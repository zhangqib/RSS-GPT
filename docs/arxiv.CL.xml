Abstract: The rapid advancement of language models has demonstrated the potential of artificial intelligence in the healthcare industry. However, small language models struggle with specialized domains in low-resource languages like Persian. While numerous medical-domain websites exist in Persian, no curated dataset or corpus has been available making ours the first of its kind. This study introduces a newly curated dataset comprising 20k doctor-patient Q\&amp;A pairs and 60\% of a 90-million-token crawled corpus from medical magazines. Using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach, we enhanced the medical knowledge of the baseline model, aya-expanse-8b. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves improved accuracy in medical question answering and successfully passed the Iranian Basic Medical Science Entrance Exam (IBSEE) in September 2023, which the baseline model did not. Additionally, the fine-tuned model improved Persian-translated MMLU accuracy by an average of 2.67\%. This work highlights the potential of leveraging open-access online data to enrich small language models in medical fields, providing a novel solution for Persian medical AI applications suitable for resource-constrained environments. Future research could explore multimodal input to further enhance performance.

<div> steering, large language models, activation, amortized learning, hallucinations  
Summary:  
Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning (CASAL) is introduced as an algorithm to reduce hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) without the need for real-time monitoring. CASAL connects interpretability with amortized optimization by embedding activation steering benefits into the model's weights during training. This approach results in LLMs abstaining from confidently providing incorrect answers to questions they do not know. CASAL shows a 30%-40% reduction in hallucination across various short-form QA benchmarks, with significantly higher efficiency compared to existing baselines such as LoRA-based methods. It is also demonstrated to be effective in out-of-distribution domains, showcasing its flexibility in text-only and vision-language models. CASAL is the first steering-based training method proven to work for both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, making it a promising advancement for practical deployment in production systems.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations. These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning (CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by 30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment in production systems.

<div> Keywords: language models, research assistant, photonics, knowledge base, citation pipeline

Summary: 
RA-FSM is a research assistant system that enhances the capabilities of large language models by incorporating a finite-state control loop for improved relevance, confidence, and knowledge in literature synthesis. Grounded in vector retrieval and a deterministic citation pipeline, the system efficiently filters queries, scores answerability, and utilizes a ranked-tier ingestion workflow to construct a domain knowledge base in the field of photonics. Evaluation on various task categories shows that domain experts prefer RA-FSM over other models due to its stronger boundary-condition handling and more defensible evidence use. The system explores beyond traditional models while maintaining tunable latency and cost overheads. Overall, RA-FSM provides transparent, well-cited answers suitable for high-stakes technical work and can be easily adapted to other scientific domains.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models accelerate literature synthesis but can hallucinate and mis-cite, limiting their usefulness in expert workflows. We present RA-FSM (Research Assistant - Finite State Machine), a modular GPT-based research assistant that wraps generation in a finite-state control loop: Relevance -> Confidence -> Knowledge. The system is grounded in vector retrieval and a deterministic citation pipeline. The controller filters out-of-scope queries, scores answerability, decomposes questions, and triggers retrieval only when needed, and emits answers with confidence labels and in-corpus, de-duplicated references. A ranked-tier ingestion workflow constructs a domain knowledge base from journals, conferences, indices, preprints, and patents, writing both to a dense vector index and to a relational store of normalized metrics. We implement the system for photonics and evaluate it on six task categories: analytical reasoning, numerical analysis, methodological critique, comparative synthesis, factual extraction, and application design. In blinded A/B reviews, domain experts prefer RA-FSM to both a strong Notebook LM (NLM) and a vanilla Default GPT API call single-pass baseline, citing stronger boundary-condition handling and more defensible evidence use. Coverage and novelty analyses indicate that RA-FSM explores beyond the NLM while incurring tunable latency and cost overheads. The design emphasizes transparent, well-cited answers for high-stakes technical work and is generalizable to other scientific domains.

<div> Transformer, speech-to-speech, Large Language Model, hybrid architecture, real-time

Summary:
- The paper introduces a novel hybrid architecture that combines real-time speech-to-speech (S2S) models with a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) backend for improved knowledge representation.
- User speech is processed through an S2S transformer for immediate responsiveness, while the query is simultaneously sent to the LLM for a text-based response.
- The LLM's response guides the S2S model's speech generation, enhancing the output with rich knowledge without significantly increasing latency.
- The system outperforms a baseline S2S model in response correctness, approaching the performance of a cascaded system, while maintaining latency comparable to the baseline. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time speech-to-speech (S2S) models excel at generating natural, low-latency conversational responses but often lack deep knowledge and semantic understanding. Conversely, cascaded systems combining automatic speech recognition, a text-based Large Language Model (LLM), and text-to-speech synthesis offer superior knowledge representation at the cost of high latency, which disrupts the flow of natural interaction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Our framework processes user speech through an S2S transformer for immediate responsiveness while concurrently relaying the query to a powerful back-end LLM. The LLM's text-based response is then injected in real time to guide the S2S model's speech generation, effectively infusing its output with rich knowledge without the full latency penalty of a cascaded system. We evaluated our method using a speech-synthesized variant of the MT-Bench benchmark that consists of multi-turn question-answering sessions. The results demonstrate that our system substantially outperforms a baseline S2S model in response correctness, approaching that of a cascaded system, while maintaining a latency on par with the baseline.

<div> Keywords: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models, Med-VQA, AMANDA, medical reasoning, low-resource settings<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces AMANDA, a framework designed to enhance medical reasoning in low-resource settings for medical visual question answering. Existing Med-MLLMs often struggle in these settings due to reasoning bottlenecks. AMANDA addresses these limitations with training-free medical knowledge augmentation through LLM agents. This augmentation includes both intrinsic, focusing on question decomposition for improved diagnosis, and extrinsic, incorporating biomedical knowledge graph retrieval for grounded reasoning. Experimental results across multiple Med-VQA benchmarks show significant improvements in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. The framework's code is available for public access, providing a useful resource for the medical community. <div>
arXiv:2510.02328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Multimodal Large Language Models (Med-MLLMs) have shown great promise in medical visual question answering (Med-VQA). However, when deployed in low-resource settings where abundant labeled data are unavailable, existing Med-MLLMs commonly fail due to their medical reasoning capability bottlenecks: (i) the intrinsic reasoning bottleneck that ignores the details from the medical image; (ii) the extrinsic reasoning bottleneck that fails to incorporate specialized medical knowledge. To address those limitations, we propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings. The code is available at https://github.com/REAL-Lab-NU/AMANDA.

<div> Keywords: Speculative decoding, LLM inference, judge decoding, self-supervision, NLP tasks

Summary:
SelfJudge introduces a novel approach for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference by training judge verifiers through self-supervision of the target model. This method assesses semantic preservation by evaluating whether token-substituted responses maintain the original meaning, enabling automatic verifier training across diverse Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The proposed SelfJudge outperforms judge decoding baselines in terms of inference-accuracy trade-offs, offering a broadly applicable solution for faster LLM inference. By leveraging self-supervision, SelfJudge eliminates the reliance on human annotations and verifiable ground truths, enhancing generalizability across various NLP tasks. This approach allows for the verification of candidate tokens from a draft model against a larger target model, with the flexibility to accept minor discrepancies in output. Overall, SelfJudge provides a promising solution for improving the efficiency and accuracy of LLM inference.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by verifying candidate tokens from a draft model against a larger target model. Recent judge decoding boosts this process by relaxing verification criteria by accepting draft tokens that may exhibit minor discrepancies from target model output, but existing methods are restricted by their reliance on human annotations or tasks with verifiable ground truths, limiting generalizability across diverse NLP tasks. We propose SelfJudge, which trains judge verifiers via self-supervision of the target model. Our method measures semantic preservation by assessing whether token-substituted responses preserve the meaning of original responses, enabling automatic verifier training across diverse NLP tasks. Our experiments show SelfJudge achieves superior inference-accuracy trade-offs than judge decoding baselines, offering a broadly applicable solution for faster LLM inference.

<div> Keywords: long-context language models, data construction, predictive uncertainty, entropy-based verification, long-range dependencies 

Summary:
EntropyLong introduces a novel approach to training long-context language models by utilizing predictive uncertainty to validate the quality of long-range dependencies. By identifying high-entropy positions in documents and retrieving semantically relevant contexts from large corpora, EntropyLong ensures that the dependencies represent genuine information gain rather than spurious correlation. The constructed training samples consist of original documents combined with verified contextual supplements, leading to significant improvements on RULER benchmarks and enhanced understanding of long-context information. Models trained using EntropyLong also demonstrate substantial gains on LongBenchv2 after instruction fine-tuning. Ablation studies further support the effectiveness of entropy-based verification in long-context training, highlighting the importance of ensuring the quality of dependencies for capturing distant information effectively. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training long-context language models to capture long-range dependencies requires specialized data construction. Current approaches, such as generic text concatenation or heuristic-based variants, frequently fail to guarantee genuine long-range dependencies. We propose EntropyLong, a novel data construction method that leverages predictive uncertainty to verify dependency quality. Our approach identifies high-entropy positions in documents, retrieves semantically relevant contexts from large corpora, and verifies their utility by assessing whether they reduce prediction entropy. This model-in-the-loop verification ensures each dependency represents measurable information gain rather than spurious correlation. We construct training samples with long-range dependencies by combining original documents with these verified contextual supplements. Using FineWebEdu and Cosmopedia, we generate a dataset of 128K-length sequences with verified dependencies. Models trained on this data demonstrate significant improvements on RULER benchmarks, particularly in tasks requiring distant information. Following instruction fine-tuning, our models also achieve substantial gains on LongBenchv2, demonstrating enhanced long-context understanding. Extensive ablation studies further validate the necessity and effectiveness of entropybased verification for long-context training.

Summary:
Generating natural dialogues for conversational recommender systems (CRSs) using language models (LMs) poses challenges due to the lack of public data. To address this, a methodology is developed using behavior simulators and LM-prompting to create dialogues consistent with the user's underlying state. This approach results in a large, open-source CRS dataset with preference elicitation and critiquing examples. Rater evaluation shows the generated dialogues exhibit consistency, factuality, and naturalness. Through the integration of user simulators and LM-driven prompting, the methodology enhances the quality of generated dialogues for CRSs.

Abstract: While language models (LMs) offer great potential for conversational recommender systems (CRSs), the paucity of public CRS data makes fine-tuning LMs for CRSs challenging. In response, LMs as user simulators qua data generators can be used to train LM-based CRSs, but often lack behavioral consistency, generating utterance sequences inconsistent with those of any real user. To address this, we develop a methodology for generating natural dialogues that are consistent with a user's underlying state using behavior simulators together with LM-prompting. We illustrate our approach by generating a large, open-source CRS data set with both preference elicitation and example critiquing. Rater evaluation on some of these dialogues shows them to exhibit considerable consistency, factuality and naturalness.

Summary: 
The article discusses neural linguistic steganography techniques aiming to embed information into natural text while maintaining statistical undetectability. Tokenization ambiguity in modern tokenizers poses a challenge, leading to decoding failures. The SyncPool method addresses this issue but sacrifices embedding capacity. The proposed look-ahead Sync method overcomes this limitation by maximizing embedding capacity while ensuring provable security. The approach strategically samples synchronized token sequences, optimizing embedding capacity without sacrificing security. The method's theoretical proofs validate its security guarantees. Experiments on English and Chinese benchmarks demonstrate the approach's superior performance over SyncPool, with an increase in embedding rate of over 160% in English and 25% in Chinese settings with larger candidate pools. This work represents a significant advancement towards practical, high-capacity, and provably secure linguistic steganography.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Neural linguistic steganography aims to embed information
  into natural text while preserving statistical undetectability. A fundamental challenge in this ffeld stems from tokenization ambiguity in modern tokenizers, which can lead to catastrophic decoding failures. The recent method, SyncPool, addresses this ambiguity
  by employing a coarse-grained synchronization mechanism over groups of ambiguous candidates. However, SyncPool sacriffces embedding capacity, as it utilizes the entire Shannon entropy of an ambiguous group solely for synchronization rather than for payload embedding. We propose a method named look-ahead Sync, which overcomes the capacity limitation of SyncPool while retaining its provable security guarantees. Our approach performs minimal synchronized sampling only on truly indistinguishable token sequences, while strategically preserving all other discernible paths to maximize embedding capacity. We provide theoretical proofs for the security of our method and analyze the gap between its achievable embedding capacity and the theoretical upper bound. Experiments on English (using Llama 3) and Chinese (using Qwen 2.5) benchmarks show that our method consistently approaches the theoretical capacity upper bound and signiffcantly outperforms SyncPool. The improvement in embedding rate exceeds 160% in English and 25% in Chinese, particularly in settings with larger candidate pools. This work represents a signiffcant step toward practical high-capacity provably secure linguistic steganography.

Summary:
The paper introduces two datasets of semantically enriched human trajectories sourced from GPS traces on OpenStreetMap. These datasets include contextual layers such as stops, moves, points of interest, inferred transportation modes, and weather data. Additionally, synthetic social media posts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) are included, enabling multimodal and semantic mobility analysis. The datasets are available in tabular and RDF formats, supporting semantic reasoning and FAIR data practices. Covering Paris and New York, the datasets can be customized using an open-source reproducible pipeline. This resource allows for behavior modeling, mobility prediction, knowledge graph construction, and LLM-based applications. Notably, this is the first resource to combine real-world movement, semantic enrichment, LLM-generated text, and semantic web compatibility in a reusable framework.

Abstract: In this resource paper, we present two publicly available datasets of semantically enriched human trajectories, together with the pipeline to build them. The trajectories are publicly available GPS traces retrieved from OpenStreetMap. Each dataset includes contextual layers such as stops, moves, points of interest (POIs), inferred transportation modes, and weather data. A novel semantic feature is the inclusion of synthetic, realistic social media posts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling multimodal and semantic mobility analysis. The datasets are available in both tabular and Resource Description Framework (RDF) formats, supporting semantic reasoning and FAIR data practices. They cover two structurally distinct, large cities: Paris and New York. Our open source reproducible pipeline allows for dataset customization, while the datasets support research tasks such as behavior modeling, mobility prediction, knowledge graph construction, and LLM-based applications. To our knowledge, our resource is the first to combine real-world movement, structured semantic enrichment, LLM-generated text, and semantic web compatibility in a reusable framework.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, AI safety, undesirable behaviors, representation analysis, token-level analysis

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities but often exhibit undesirable behaviors such as generating harmful content, factual inaccuracies, and societal biases. The challenge lies in identifying the root causes of these failures for AI safety. Traditional attribution methods based on parameter gradients have limitations due to noisy signals and computational complexity. In response, a novel framework is introduced to diagnose a range of undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representations and gradients in the activation space. The approach proves effective in tasks like tracking harmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge contamination. Not only does it excel in sample-level attribution, but it also enables precise token-level analysis to pinpoint specific samples and phrases influencing model behavior. This work offers a valuable diagnostic tool for understanding, auditing, and mitigating risks associated with LLMs. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their deployment is frequently undermined by undesirable behaviors such as generating harmful content, factual inaccuracies, and societal biases. Diagnosing the root causes of these failures poses a critical challenge for AI safety. Existing attribution methods, particularly those based on parameter gradients, often fall short due to prohibitive noisy signals and computational complexity. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient framework that diagnoses a range of undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representation and its gradients, which operates directly in the model's activation space to provide a semantically meaningful signal linking outputs to their training data. We systematically evaluate our method for tasks that include tracking harmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge contamination. The results demonstrate that our approach not only excels at sample-level attribution but also enables fine-grained token-level analysis, precisely identifying the specific samples and phrases that causally influence model behavior. This work provides a powerful diagnostic tool to understand, audit, and ultimately mitigate the risks associated with LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/plumprc/RepT.

Summary: 
Large language models have shown great progress in theorem proving but their capability as mathematical assistants remains largely unexplored. The challenge of subgoal completion, where LLMs help resolve proof obligations in complex proofs, is identified. A benchmark called FormalML is introduced, comprised of 4937 problems in optimization and probability inequalities. These problems vary in difficulty and are presented in research-level contexts, requiring both premise retrieval and complex reasoning. Evaluation of current provers shows limitations in accuracy and efficiency, highlighting the need for more capable LLM-based theorem provers for effective subgoal completion. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in formal theorem proving. Yet their ability to serve as practical assistants for mathematicians, filling in missing steps within complex proofs, remains underexplored. We identify this challenge as the task of subgoal completion, where an LLM must discharge short but nontrivial proof obligations left unresolved in a human-provided sketch. To study this problem, we introduce FormalML, a Lean 4 benchmark built from foundational theories of machine learning. Using a translation tactic that converts procedural proofs into declarative form, we extract 4937 problems spanning optimization and probability inequalities, with varying levels of difficulty. FormalML is the first subgoal completion benchmark to combine premise retrieval and complex research-level contexts. Evaluation of state-of-the-art provers highlights persistent limitations in accuracy and efficiency, underscoring the need for more capable LLM-based theorem provers for effective subgoal completion,

Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) is vital for NLP tasks but lacks resources for low-resource languages like Kurdish. The first Kurdish STS dataset, comprising 10,000 annotated sentence pairs, was introduced. The dataset covers formal and informal registers. Strong baselines including Sentence-BERT and multilingual BERT were benchmarked, yielding competitive results. Challenges specific to Kurdish, such as morphology, orthographic variation, and code-mixing, were highlighted. The dataset and baselines create a reproducible evaluation suite and serve as a foundation for future research on Kurdish semantics and low-resource NLP. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) measures the degree of meaning overlap between two texts and underpins many NLP tasks. While extensive resources exist for high-resource languages, low-resource languages such as Kurdish remain underserved. We present, to our knowledge, the first Kurdish STS dataset: 10,000 sentence pairs spanning formal and informal registers, each annotated for similarity. We benchmark Sentence-BERT, multilingual BERT, and other strong baselines, obtaining competitive results while highlighting challenges arising from Kurdish morphology, orthographic variation, and code-mixing. The dataset and baselines establish a reproducible evaluation suite and provide a strong starting point for future research on Kurdish semantics and low-resource NLP.

This paper introduces the CRACQ framework, designed to evaluate documents based on Coherence, Rigor, Appropriateness, Completeness, and Quality. Unlike single-score methods, CRACQ considers linguistic, semantic, and structural signals to provide both holistic and trait-level assessments of machine-generated text. Trained on synthetic grant proposals and tested on real applications, CRACQ demonstrates more stable and interpretable trait-level judgments compared to direct human evaluation.

Building on insights from traitbased Automated Essay Scoring (AES), CRACQ expands its fo-cus beyond essays to encompass diverse forms of machine-generated text, providing a rubricdriven and interpretable methodology for automated evaluation. Unlike singlescore approaches, CRACQ integrates linguistic, semantic, and structural signals into a cumulative assessment, enabling both holistic and trait-level analysis. Trained on 500 synthetic grant pro-posals, CRACQ was benchmarked against an LLM-as-a-judge and further tested on both strong and weak real applications. Preliminary results in-dicate that CRACQ produces more stable and interpretable trait-level judgments than direct LLM evaluation, though challenges in reliability and domain scope remain

<div> Keywords: clinical documentation, language models, reinforcement learning, factual grounding, completeness

Summary:
Automating clinical documentation using large language models requires precise alignment with priorities such as completeness and factual grounding. A new evaluation-integrated reinforcement learning framework for long-form clinical text generation has been developed, utilizing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) coupled with DocLens, a claim-level evaluator that offers deterministic rewards based on dialogue-grounded assessments. This method focuses on optimizing factual grounding and completeness without the need for a separate reward model or human-authored references. Empirical results demonstrate improved clinical note quality and reduced training costs through a straightforward reward-gating strategy. An independent evaluation of GPT-5 confirms the enhanced factuality, completeness, and brevity of outputs generated by the GRPO approach, with fewer omissions and hallucinations. These improvements, while significant, are likely a conservative estimate given the baseline model's alignment with benchmarks. The framework is adaptable to real-world applications and can integrate custom objectives such as guideline adherence or billing preferences.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Automating clinical documentation with large language models requires precise alignment with priorities such as completeness and factual grounding. We present an evaluation-integrated reinforcement learning framework for long-form clinical text generation that couples Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with DocLens, a claim-level evaluator that provides deterministic, dialogue-grounded rewards. Our method directly optimizes factual grounding and completeness without training a separate reward model or relying on human-authored references. Empirically, the approach improves clinical note quality and reduces training cost via a simple reward-gating strategy. An independent GPT-5 qualitative evaluation further supports these gains, showing higher preference for GRPO outputs in factuality, completeness, and brevity, with fewer omissions and hallucinations. Because the benchmarks are relatively clean and the base model already well aligned, these improvements likely represent a conservative lower bound. The framework is scalable to real-world settings and can incorporate custom objectives such as guideline adherence or billing preferences.

Summary: Research focuses on uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs) to ensure their reliability. The study integrates UQ methods into argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), a framework for decision-making based on computational argumentation. Experiments evaluate ArgLLMs' performance on claim verification tasks using various UQ methods. The study's novel experimental approach assesses the effectiveness of UQ methods, especially in handling complex and contentious statements. Results show that direct prompting is a highly effective UQ strategy in ArgLLMs, surpassing more complex approaches. This suggests that simplicity can be key in UQ for ArgLLMs and potentially other LLM applications. <div>

Abstract: Research in uncertainty quantification (UQ) for large language models (LLMs) is increasingly important towards guaranteeing the reliability of this groundbreaking technology. We explore the integration of LLM UQ methods in argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), an explainable LLM framework for decision-making based on computational argumentation in which UQ plays a critical role. We conduct experiments to evaluate ArgLLMs' performance on claim verification tasks when using different LLM UQ methods, inherently performing an assessment of the UQ methods' effectiveness. Moreover, the experimental procedure itself is a novel way of evaluating the effectiveness of UQ methods, especially when intricate and potentially contentious statements are present. Our results demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, direct prompting is an effective UQ strategy in ArgLLMs, outperforming considerably more complex approaches.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, temporal prediction, knowledge cutoff, prompting, forgetting

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are often used for temporal prediction tasks but their reliance on pretraining data can lead to contamination concerns. This study explores the use of prompting to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff in LLMs. Three evaluation datasets were created to assess the LLMs' ability to forget direct factual knowledge, semantic shifts, and causally related knowledge. Results indicate that while prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs are effective when queried directly, they struggle to induce forgetting of information that is not directly asked but causally related. This suggests a need for more rigorous evaluation settings when using LLMs for temporal prediction tasks. The full dataset and evaluation code are available for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for temporal prediction, but their reliance on pretraining data raises contamination concerns, as accurate predictions on pre-cutoff test data may reflect memorization rather than reasoning, leading to an overestimation of their generalization capability. With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff? In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks.

<div> Keywords: large language model, preference learning, dissatisfaction signals, iterative training, post-training

Summary:
In this paper, the authors introduce DRIFT (Dissatisfaction-Refined Iterative Preference Training), a novel approach for training large language models using real-world dissatisfaction signals. Unlike existing methods that rely on costly human annotations or assume abundant positive feedback, DRIFT anchors training on implicit user dissatisfaction signals and samples positive feedback dynamically from the evolving model policy. Empirical results demonstrate that DRIFT outperforms strong baseline methods and achieves significant improvements in model performance on both real-world and synthetic datasets. In particular, at larger scales, DRIFT-trained models surpass state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o-mini. Furthermore, DRIFT preserves exploratory capacity, leading to more diverse and high-reward solutions. Theoretical analysis shows that the design of DRIFT maintains preference margins and prevents gradient degeneration. Overall, DRIFT is shown to be an effective and scalable approach for training large language models using abundant and informative dissatisfaction signals. The code and data for DRIFT are available on GitHub for further exploration. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world large language model deployments (e.g., conversational AI systems, code generation assistants) naturally generate abundant implicit user dissatisfaction (DSAT) signals, as users iterate toward better answers through refinements, corrections, and expressed preferences, while explicit satisfaction (SAT) feedback is scarce. Existing preference learning approaches are poorly aligned with this data profile, as they rely on costly human annotations or assume plentiful positive responses. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}issatisfaction-\textbf{R}efined \textbf{I}terative pre\textbf{F}erence \textbf{T}raining), which anchors training on real-world DSAT signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy. Empirically, DRIFT models trained on real-world \textit{WildFeedback} datasets and synthetic \textit{UltraFeedback} datasets achieve up to +6.23\% (7B) / +7.61\% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95\% (7B) / +12.29\% (14B) on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, outperforming strong baseline methods such as iterative DPO and SPIN. At larger scales, the improvements are particularly pronounced: 14B models trained with DRIFT surpass GPT-4o-mini on WildBench. Further analysis shows that DRIFT also preserves exploratory capacity, yielding more diverse high-reward solutions rather than collapsing to narrow subsets. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this design preserves preference margins and avoids the gradient degeneration. These results show that DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training that leverages the most abundant and informative signal. The code and data are available at https://github.com/cacayaya/DRIFT.git.

Summary:
The article introduces SIMPACT, a toolkit for creating behaviorally-grounded social media datasets for training large language models (LLMs) as agents. It focuses on next-action prediction and introduces metrics for assessing behavioral fidelity and stylistic realism at both cluster and population levels. The BluePrint dataset, derived from public Bluesky data, anonymizes users into personas and includes a variety of social media interaction types. This dataset allows for the development of LLM-based agents that can model both language and interaction behaviors on social media. By standardizing data and evaluation protocols, SIMPACT aims to advance ethical and rigorous social media simulations. BluePrint serves as a benchmark for political discourse modeling and can be used to study challenges such as misinformation and polarization.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for simulating social media dynamics at scale, enabling studies that would be ethically or logistically challenging with human subjects. However, the field lacks standardized data resources for fine-tuning and evaluating LLMs as realistic social media agents. We address this gap by introducing SIMPACT, the SIMulation-oriented Persona and Action Capture Toolkit, a privacy respecting framework for constructing behaviorally-grounded social media datasets suitable for training agent models. We formulate next-action prediction as a task for training and evaluating LLM-based agents and introduce metrics at both the cluster and population levels to assess behavioral fidelity and stylistic realism. As a concrete implementation, we release BluePrint, a large-scale dataset built from public Bluesky data focused on political discourse. BluePrint clusters anonymized users into personas of aggregated behaviours, capturing authentic engagement patterns while safeguarding privacy through pseudonymization and removal of personally identifiable information. The dataset includes a sizable action set of 12 social media interaction types (likes, replies, reposts, etc.), each instance tied to the posting activity preceding it. This supports the development of agents that use context-dependence, not only in the language, but also in the interaction behaviours of social media to model social media users. By standardizing data and evaluation protocols, SIMPACT provides a foundation for advancing rigorous, ethically responsible social media simulations. BluePrint serves as both an evaluation benchmark for political discourse modeling and a template for building domain specific datasets to study challenges such as misinformation and polarization.

<div> dynamic expert clustering, structured compression, parameter reduction, hierarchical routing, heterogeneous precision<br />
<br />
Summary: 
This study introduces a framework for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) to address the challenges of load imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. The framework utilizes dynamic expert clustering to stabilize expert utilization and reduce parameter redundancy. By decomposing expert weights into shared base matrices and low-rank residual adapters, the model achieves significant parameter reduction while maintaining specialization. A hierarchical routing strategy assigns tokens to specific clusters and experts, decreasing the routing search space and communication volume. A heterogeneous precision scheme and dynamic offloading of inactive clusters reduce memory consumption. Evaluation on GLUE and WikiText-103 datasets shows that the framework maintains model quality while reducing parameters by 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and decreasing expert load variance. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of structural reorganization for scalable, efficient, and memory-effective MoE LLMs. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.02345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Large Language Models (LLMs) face a trilemma of load imbalance, parameter redundancy, and communication overhead. We introduce a unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient, and memory-effective MoE LLMs.

Summary: 
In this study, the development and evaluation of AI teaching assistants using small language models (SLMs) for curriculum-based guidance are explored. The research focused on a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline applied to selected SLMs to provide accurate and pedagogically aligned responses. Benchmarking eight SLMs against GPT-4o showed that with proper prompting and targeted retrieval, SLMs can match the performance of large language models (LLMs) in educational settings. One significant advantage of SLMs is their lower computational and energy requirements, enabling real-time use on consumer-grade hardware without relying on cloud infrastructure. This makes SLMs cost-effective, privacy-preserving, and environmentally responsible, making them suitable AI teaching assistants for educational institutions looking to scale personalized learning sustainably and efficiently. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The adoption of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) in education is still emerging. In this study, we explore the development and evaluation of AI teaching assistants that provide curriculum-based guidance using a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline applied to selected open-source small language models (SLMs). We benchmarked eight SLMs, including LLaMA 3.1, IBM Granite 3.3, and Gemma 3 (7-17B parameters), against GPT-4o. Our findings show that with proper prompting and targeted retrieval, SLMs can match LLMs in delivering accurate, pedagogically aligned responses. Importantly, SLMs offer significant sustainability benefits due to their lower computational and energy requirements, enabling real-time use on consumer-grade hardware without depending on cloud infrastructure. This makes them not only cost-effective and privacy-preserving but also environmentally responsible, positioning them as viable AI teaching assistants for educational institutions aiming to scale personalized learning in a sustainable and energy-efficient manner.

mini-vec2vec is introduced as an efficient and stable alternative to the original vec2vec procedure for aligning text embedding spaces without parallel data. The method utilizes a linear transformation and consists of three key stages: matching pseudo-parallel embedding vectors, fitting transformations, and iterative refinement. mini-vec2vec surpasses the original vec2vec in efficiency by orders of magnitude while achieving comparable or superior results. The method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps make it highly scalable and applicable in various domains.

Abstract: We build upon vec2vec, a procedure designed to align text embedding spaces without parallel data. vec2vec finds a near-perfect alignment, but it is expensive and unstable. We present mini-vec2vec, a simple and efficient alternative that requires substantially lower computational cost and is highly robust. Moreover, the learned mapping is a linear transformation. Our method consists of three main stages: a tentative matching of pseudo-parallel embedding vectors, transformation fitting, and iterative refinement. Our linear alternative exceeds the original instantiation of vec2vec by orders of magnitude in efficiency, while matching or exceeding their results. The method's stability and interpretable algorithmic steps facilitate scaling and unlock new opportunities for adoption in new domains and fields.

Summary: 
The article introduces LLMSQL, a revised version of the WikiSQL dataset, tailored for modern language models (LLMs). The WikiSQL dataset, while important in NL2SQL research, had issues like inconsistencies and errors. LLMSQL addresses these issues through systematic revision and transformation. The dataset is cleaned and re-annotated using automated methods, making it suitable for evaluating large language models. LLMSQL serves as an LLM-ready benchmark, providing clean natural language questions and full SQL queries in plain text format. This enables straightforward generation and evaluation for current natural language-to-SQL models, unlike the original WikiSQL designed for pointer-network models.Multiple large language models such as Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral 7B, and others were evaluated on LLMSQL, showcasing its effectiveness in NL2SQL tasks. Overall, LLMSQL enhances the usability and accuracy of text-to-SQL systems, addressing the limitations of earlier datasets like WikiSQL. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Converting natural language questions into SQL queries (Text-to-SQL) enables non-expert users to interact with relational databases and has long been a central task for natural language interfaces to data. While the WikiSQL dataset played a key role in early NL2SQL research, its usage has declined due to structural and annotation issues, including case sensitivity inconsistencies, data type mismatches, syntax errors, and unanswered questions. We present LLMSQL, a systematic revision and transformation of WikiSQL designed for the LLM era. We classify these errors and implement automated methods for cleaning and re-annotation. To assess the impact of these improvements, we evaluated multiple large language models (LLMs), including Gemma 3, LLaMA 3.2, Mistral 7B, gpt-oss 20B, Phi-3.5 Mini, Qwen 2.5, OpenAI o4-mini, DeepSeek R1 and others. Rather than serving as an update, LLMSQL is introduced as an LLM-ready benchmark: unlike the original WikiSQL, tailored for pointer-network models selecting tokens from input, LLMSQL provides clean natural language questions and full SQL queries as plain text, enabling straightforward generation and evaluation for modern natural language-to-SQL models.

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) were evaluated on their ability to assess offensiveness in political discourse from different political perspectives in English, Polish, and Russian contexts using the MD-Agreement dataset. Models like DeepSeek-R1 and o4-mini with explicit reasoning abilities showed better consistency and sensitivity to ideological and cultural variation compared to smaller models like GPT-4.1-mini and Qwen3. The study found that reasoning capabilities significantly improved the personalization and interpretability of offensiveness judgments, especially in capturing subtle distinctions. The results suggest that incorporating reasoning mechanisms is crucial for adapting LLMs for nuanced sociopolitical text classification across different languages and political ideologies.

1. Evaluation of LLMs on assessing offensiveness in political discourse 
2. Models like DeepSeek-R1 and o4-mini showed better sensitivity to ideological and cultural variations

Abstract: We explore how large language models (LLMs) assess offensiveness in political discourse when prompted to adopt specific political and cultural perspectives. Using a multilingual subset of the MD-Agreement dataset centered on tweets from the 2020 US elections, we evaluate several recent LLMs - including DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini, GPT-4.1-mini, Qwen3, Gemma, and Mistral - tasked with judging tweets as offensive or non-offensive from the viewpoints of varied political personas (far-right, conservative, centrist, progressive) across English, Polish, and Russian contexts. Our results show that larger models with explicit reasoning abilities (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, o4-mini) are more consistent and sensitive to ideological and cultural variation, while smaller models often fail to capture subtle distinctions. We find that reasoning capabilities significantly improve both the personalization and interpretability of offensiveness judgments, suggesting that such mechanisms are key to adapting LLMs for nuanced sociopolitical text classification across languages and ideologies.

Summary:<br />
This paper examines biases in spoken dialogue models, specifically focusing on the effects of paralinguistic features such as age, gender, and accent. The study evaluates biases in speech LLMs and considers the impact of multi-turn dialogues with repeated negative feedback on model outputs. Biases are measured using Group Unfairness Score (GUS) for decisions and similarity-based normalized statistics rate (SNSR) for recommendations. The analysis compares open-source models like Qwen2.5-Omni and GLM-4-Voice with closed-source APIs such as GPT-4o Audio and Gemini-2.5-Flash. The findings show that closed-source models generally exhibit lower bias, while open-source models are more sensitive to age and gender. Recommendation tasks tend to amplify cross-group disparities. Biased decisions may persist in multi-turn conversations, highlighting the importance of addressing biases in end-to-end spoken dialogue models for fair and reliable audio-based interactive systems.<br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: While biases in large language models (LLMs), such as stereotypes and cultural tendencies in outputs, have been examined and identified, their presence and characteristics in spoken dialogue models (SDMs) with audio input and output remain largely unexplored. Paralinguistic features, such as age, gender, and accent, can affect model outputs; when compounded by multi-turn conversations, these effects may exacerbate biases, with potential implications for fairness in decision-making and recommendation tasks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate biases in speech LLMs and study the impact of multi-turn dialogues with repeated negative feedback. Bias is measured using Group Unfairness Score (GUS) for decisions and similarity-based normalized statistics rate (SNSR) for recommendations, across both open-source models like Qwen2.5-Omni and GLM-4-Voice, as well as closed-source APIs such as GPT-4o Audio and Gemini-2.5-Flash. Our analysis reveals that closed-source models generally exhibit lower bias, while open-source models are more sensitive to age and gender, and recommendation tasks tend to amplify cross-group disparities. We found that biased decisions may persist in multi-turn conversations. This work provides the first systematic study of biases in end-to-end spoken dialogue models, offering insights towards fair and reliable audio-based interactive systems. To facilitate further research, we release the FairDialogue dataset and evaluation code.

Summary: 
The study explores the abstractness of meaning representations in the human language system using neural responses to sentences. By generating images corresponding to sentences and extracting vision model embeddings, researchers found that aggregating across multiple images improved prediction accuracy of language cortex responses. Averaging embeddings across multiple paraphrases of a sentence also enhanced prediction accuracy. Furthermore, enriching paraphrases with contextual details led to increased accuracy, surpassing predictions based on the original sentence embedding. These findings suggest the existence of highly abstract, form-independent meaning representations within the language cortex, indicating that the language system maintains richer and broader semantic representations compared to language models. <div>

Abstract: The human language system represents both linguistic forms and meanings, but the abstractness of the meaning representations remains debated. Here, we searched for abstract representations of meaning in the language cortex by modeling neural responses to sentences using representations from vision and language models. When we generate images corresponding to sentences and extract vision model embeddings, we find that aggregating across multiple generated images yields increasingly accurate predictions of language cortex responses, sometimes rivaling large language models. Similarly, averaging embeddings across multiple paraphrases of a sentence improves prediction accuracy compared to any single paraphrase. Enriching paraphrases with contextual details that may be implicit (e.g., augmenting "I had a pancake" to include details like "maple syrup") further increases prediction accuracy, even surpassing predictions based on the embedding of the original sentence, suggesting that the language system maintains richer and broader semantic representations than language models. Together, these results demonstrate the existence of highly abstract, form-independent meaning representations within the language cortex.

<div> DiffuSpec, training-free, diffusion-based drafting, speculative decoding, large language models, autoregressive nature
Summary:
DiffuSpec is a new framework for improving the efficiency of large language models by utilizing a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) for multi-token drafting. Unlike traditional autoregressive drafting methods, DiffuSpec allows for parallel generation of drafts in a single forward pass, leading to significant speed improvements. The framework includes a causal-consistency path search (CPS) algorithm to ensure alignment with autoregressive verification processes and an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller to optimize draft proposals based on feedback. By leveraging bidirectional conditioning, DiffuSpec overcomes limitations of traditional AR drafters and achieves up to a 3x wall-clock speedup in speculative decoding tasks. This approach offers a promising alternative for enhancing the efficiency of large language models without the need for extensive retraining. <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale up, accuracy improves, but the autoregressive (AR) nature of decoding increases latency since each token requires a serial forward pass. Speculative decoding addresses this by employing a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified in parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR drafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the drafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that uses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts in a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR verifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning, parallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally highest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right path. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a speed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two practical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this lattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and (ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size based on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length. Across benchmarks, DiffuSpec yields up to 3x wall-clock speedup, establishing diffusion-based drafting as a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters for speculative decoding.

<div> knowledge-enhanced, large language model, atmospheric emissions, Emission-GPT, domain-specific
Summary: 
The article introduces Emission-GPT, a large language model designed for the atmospheric emissions domain. Emission-GPT utilizes a curated knowledge base of over 10,000 documents to provide accurate domain-specific question answering and interactive emissions data analysis through natural language interactions. It allows users to query, visualize inventories, analyze source contributions, and recommend emission factors for specific scenarios. A case study in Guangdong Province demonstrates Emission-GPT's ability to extract key insights from raw data with simple prompts, such as point source distributions and sectoral trends. The modular and extensible architecture of Emission-GPT enables the automation of manual workflows, making it a foundational tool for next-generation emission inventory development and scenario-based assessment. <div>

Abstract: Improving air quality and addressing climate change relies on accurate understanding and analysis of air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions. However, emission-related knowledge is often fragmented and highly specialized, while existing methods for accessing and compiling emissions data remain inefficient. These issues hinder the ability of non-experts to interpret emissions information, posing challenges to research and management. To address this, we present Emission-GPT, a knowledge-enhanced large language model agent tailored for the atmospheric emissions domain. Built on a curated knowledge base of over 10,000 documents (including standards, reports, guidebooks, and peer-reviewed literature), Emission-GPT integrates prompt engineering and question completion to support accurate domain-specific question answering. Emission-GPT also enables users to interactively analyze emissions data via natural language, such as querying and visualizing inventories, analyzing source contributions, and recommending emission factors for user-defined scenarios. A case study in Guangdong Province demonstrates that Emission-GPT can extract key insights--such as point source distributions and sectoral trends--directly from raw data with simple prompts. Its modular and extensible architecture facilitates automation of traditionally manual workflows, positioning Emission-GPT as a foundational tool for next-generation emission inventory development and scenario-based assessment.

Summary: 
The study evaluates the Spiral of Silence (SoS) theory in large language models (LLMs) to understand if similar dynamics can emerge in LLM collectives as in human societies. By varying the availability of History and Persona signals in LLM agents, the research shows that both signals together create strong majority dominance, replicating SoS patterns. History signals alone lead to strong anchoring of opinions, while Persona signals alone generate diverse but uncorrelated opinions. The experiments highlight the importance of historical anchoring in generating SoS dynamics. The findings bridge computational sociology and responsible AI design, emphasizing the necessity of monitoring and mitigating emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The Spiral of Silence (SoS) theory holds that individuals with minority views often refrain from speaking out for fear of social isolation, enabling majority positions to dominate public discourse. When the 'agents' are large language models (LLMs), however, the classical psychological explanation is not directly applicable, since SoS was developed for human societies. This raises a central question: can SoS-like dynamics nevertheless emerge from purely statistical language generation in LLM collectives? We propose an evaluation framework for examining SoS in LLM agents. Specifically, we consider four controlled conditions that systematically vary the availability of 'History' and 'Persona' signals. Opinion dynamics are assessed using trend tests such as Mann-Kendall and Spearman's rank, along with concentration measures including kurtosis and interquartile range. Experiments across open-source and closed-source models show that history and persona together produce strong majority dominance and replicate SoS patterns; history signals alone induce strong anchoring; and persona signals alone foster diverse but uncorrelated opinions, indicating that without historical anchoring, SoS dynamics cannot emerge. The work bridges computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to monitor and mitigate emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.

<div> Keyword: Transformer-based models, self-attention, ChunkLLM, QK Adapter, performance evaluation

Summary:
ChunkLLM is a new training framework designed to address computational inefficiencies in Transformer-based large models. It introduces two components, QK Adapter and Chunk Adapter, to compress features, acquire chunk attention, and detect chunk boundaries. During training, only the QK Adapter and Chunk Adapter are trained while the backbone parameters remain frozen. Attention distillation is used to enhance the recall rate of key chunks. Inference phase triggers chunk selection at chunk boundaries, resulting in faster model inference. Experimental evaluations show that ChunkLLM achieves comparable performance on short-text benchmarks and maintains 98.64% performance on long-context benchmarks while preserving a 48.58% key-value cache retention rate. ChunkLLM provides a maximum speedup of 4.48x in processing 120K long texts compared to the vanilla Transformer. <div>
arXiv:2510.02361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based large models excel in natural language processing and computer vision, but face severe computational inefficiencies due to the self-attention's quadratic complexity with input tokens. Recently, researchers have proposed a series of methods based on block selection and compression to alleviate this problem, but they either have issues with semantic incompleteness or poor training-inference efficiency. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose ChunkLLM, a lightweight and pluggable training framework. Specifically, we introduce two components: QK Adapter (Q-Adapter and K-Adapter) and Chunk Adapter. The former is attached to each Transformer layer, serving dual purposes of feature compression and chunk attention acquisition. The latter operates at the bottommost layer of the model, functioning to detect chunk boundaries by leveraging contextual semantic information. During the training phase, the parameters of the backbone remain frozen, with only the QK Adapter and Chunk Adapter undergoing training. Notably, we design an attention distillation method for training the QK Adapter, which enhances the recall rate of key chunks. During the inference phase, chunk selection is triggered exclusively when the current token is detected as a chunk boundary, thereby accelerating model inference. Experimental evaluations are conducted on a diverse set of long-text and short-text benchmark datasets spanning multiple tasks. ChunkLLM not only attains comparable performance on short-text benchmarks but also maintains 98.64% of the performance on long-context benchmarks while preserving a 48.58% key-value cache retention rate. Particularly, ChunkLLM attains a maximum speedup of 4.48x in comparison to the vanilla Transformer in the processing of 120K long texts.

Summary: 
The study examines how multiple Large Language Models respond to controversial Romanian historical questions to assess biases. History is often viewed through biased perspectives influenced by cultural and state ideals, which can be perpetuated by LLMs. The research process involved three stages to observe how responses varied based on the type of question posed. Results showed high but imperfect stability in binary responses, with models frequently changing stances across languages or response formats. Numeric ratings often differed from initial binary choices, and the most consistent models were not always deemed the most accurate or neutral. The research highlights the predisposition of LLMs to inconsistencies, particularly influenced by context and language specific to the question asked. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this case study, we select a set of controversial Romanian historical questions and ask multiple Large Language Models to answer them across languages and contexts, in order to assess their biases. Besides being a study mainly performed for educational purposes, the motivation also lies in the recognition that history is often presented through altered perspectives, primarily influenced by the culture and ideals of a state, even through large language models. Since they are often trained on certain data sets that may present certain ambiguities, the lack of neutrality is subsequently instilled in users. The research process was carried out in three stages, to confirm the idea that the type of response expected can influence, to a certain extent, the response itself; after providing an affirmative answer to some given question, an LLM could shift its way of thinking after being asked the same question again, but being told to respond with a numerical value of a scale. Results show that binary response stability is relatively high but far from perfect and varies by language. Models often flip stance across languages or between formats; numeric ratings frequently diverge from the initial binary choice, and the most consistent models are not always those judged most accurate or neutral. Our research brings to light the predisposition of models to such inconsistencies, within a specific contextualization of the language for the question asked.

<div> Instance-Level Context Learning, Large Language Model, Guided Exploration, Context Document, Exploration Cost<br />
<br />
Large language model agents often struggle in complex tasks due to the lack of instance-level context, which includes specific and verifiable facts about an environment instance. This context is crucial for making accurate decisions based on persistent information. The Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) problem addresses the efficient acquisition and formatting of instance-level context by using a guided exploration method that prioritizes actions and creates a reusable context document. Experiments across different environments show significant improvements in success rates and efficiency for LLM agents. For example, success rates in TextWorld tasks increase substantially with the ILCL approach. By turning one-time exploration efforts into persistent knowledge, ILCL enhances the reliability and efficiency of large language model agents.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents typically receive two kinds of context: (i) environment-level manuals that define interaction interfaces and global rules, and (ii) task-level guidance or demonstrations tied to specific goals. In this work, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context, instance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to a specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes, and local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a common source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often depends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on making decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context requires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring, validating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We formalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce our task-agnostic method to solve it. Our method performs a guided exploration, using a compact TODO forest to intelligently prioritize its next actions and a lightweight plan-act-extract loop to execute them. This process automatically produces a high-precision context document that is reusable across many downstream tasks and agents, thereby amortizing the initial exploration cost. Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter demonstrate consistent gains in both success and efficiency: for instance, ReAct's mean success rate in TextWorld rises from 37% to 95%, while IGE improves from 81% to 95%. By transforming one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, our method complements existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM agents.

<div> Keywords: language models, knowledge arbitration, retrieval-augmented generation, training conditions, parametric knowledge

Summary:
Our study examines how training conditions affect language models' use of in-context and parametric knowledge and their arbitration between the two. We trained transformer-based models on a synthetic biographies corpus under various controlled conditions. We found that intra-document repetition of facts enhances the development of both parametric and in-context capabilities. Training on datasets with inconsistent information or distributional skew helps models develop robust strategies for leveraging parametric and in-context knowledge. These challenging properties play a crucial role in learning proper knowledge arbitration. Rather than being seen as problems to eliminate, they are actually vital for creating models that effectively integrate different types of knowledge. Our insights provide practical guidance for pretraining models to strikingly combine parametric and in-context knowledge.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models often encounter conflicts between in-context knowledge retrieved at inference time and parametric knowledge acquired during pretraining. Models that accept external knowledge uncritically are vulnerable to misinformation, whereas models that adhere rigidly to parametric knowledge fail to benefit from retrieval. Despite the widespread adoption of retrieval-augmented generation, we still lack a systematic understanding of what shapes knowledge-arbitration strategies during training. This gap risks producing pretrained models with undesirable arbitration behaviors and, consequently, wasting substantial computational resources after the pretraining budget has already been spent. To address this problem, we present the first controlled study of how training conditions influence models' use of in-context and parametric knowledge, and how they arbitrate between them. We train transformer-based language models on a synthetic biographies corpus while systematically controlling various conditions. Our experiments reveal that intra-document repetition of facts fosters the development of both parametric and in-context capabilities. Moreover, training on a corpus that contains inconsistent information or distributional skew encourages models to develop robust strategies for leveraging parametric and in-context knowledge. Rather than viewing these non-ideal properties as artifacts to remove, our results indicate that they are important for learning robust arbitration. These insights offer concrete, empirical guidance for pretraining models that harmoniously integrate parametric and in-context knowledge.

Summary: 
The article introduces a memory-augmented architecture and pretraining strategy to address the limitations of scaling parameters in language models. By using hierarchical parametric memory banks, the approach enables small language models to access and fetch context-dependent memory blocks containing world knowledge during pretraining and inference. This allows for the efficient storage of long-tail world knowledge in memory parameters while the small language model focuses on capturing common knowledge and reasoning abilities. Experiments show significant performance gains, with a 160M-parameter model augmented with an 18M-parameter memory achieving performance comparable to a larger model with over double the parameters. The study explores various types and sizes of parametric memories in transformers, scaling them up to 21B parameters and demonstrating the effectiveness of hierarchical feed-forward memories across different transformer architectures. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.02375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impressive performance gains of modern language models currently rely on scaling parameters: larger models store more world knowledge and reason better. Yet compressing all world knowledge into parameters is unnecessary, as only a fraction is used per prompt, and impractical for edge devices with limited inference-time memory and compute. We address this shortcoming by a memory-augmented architecture and a pretraining strategy aligned with existing hardware paradigms. We introduce small language models that access large hierarchical parametric memory banks encoding world knowledge. During pretraining and inference, we fetch a small, context-dependent memory block and add it to the model. Our pretraining learns to store long-tail world knowledge in the memory parameters, while the small language model acts as an anchor capturing common knowledge and general reasoning abilities. Through trillion-token-scale experiments, we show significant gains: a 160M-parameters model augmented with an 18M-parameters memory fetched from a 4.6B memory bank obtains comparable performance to a regular model with more than 2x the parameters. Through extensive experiments, we study the optimal type and size of parametric memories in transformers, scaling them to over 21B parameters. We find that our proposed hierarchical feed-forward memories work robustly across transformer architectures, whether added during pretraining or post-hoc.

The proposed approach leverages the calibrated log-likelihood score to select the best response from different LLMs, capturing their inherent knowledge and confidence.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities, yet selecting the most reliable response from multiple LLMs remains a challenge, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Existing approaches often depend on costly external verifiers, human evaluators, or self-consistency techniques that require multiple samples from a single model. While multi-LLM systems produce more diverse responses than single models and thus have greater potential, they often underperform compared to single LLM self-consistency. We propose a principled, novel and computationally efficient method to select the best response from multiple different LLMs using a calibrated log-likelihood score, implicitly leveraging the inherent knowledge and confidence of these models. Our method demonstrates improvements of approx. 4%, 3%, and 5% across both debate (multi-round LLM discussions) and non-debate (Best-of-N with multiple LLMs) settings on GSM8K, MMLU (6 subsets), and ARC datasets respectively.

Summary: 
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general Question Answering (QA) but struggle with domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs with external knowledge, yet often overlooks relational databases. This study uncovers the complementarity of databases and documents for QA, emphasizing the need for efficient source selection. The authors propose a rule-driven routing framework that balances effectiveness and efficiency by routing queries to the most suitable source. Experiment results on three QA benchmarks show that the framework outperforms static and learned routing strategies, achieving higher accuracy with moderate computational cost. The framework consists of a routing agent scoring candidate augmentation paths, a rule-making expert refining rules based on feedback, and a path-level meta-cache reducing latency and cost by reusing past decisions for similar queries. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on general Question Answering (QA), yet they often struggle in domain-specific scenarios where accurate and up-to-date information is required. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by enriching LLMs with external knowledge, but existing systems primarily rely on unstructured documents, while largely overlooking relational databases, which provide precise, timely, and efficiently queryable factual information, serving as indispensable infrastructure in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research. Motivated by this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis that reveals three central observations: (i) databases and documents offer complementary strengths across queries, (ii) naively combining both sources introduces noise and cost without consistent accuracy gains, and (iii) selecting the most suitable source for each query is crucial to balance effectiveness and efficiency. We further observe that query types show consistent regularities in their alignment with retrieval paths, suggesting that routing decisions can be effectively guided by systematic rules that capture these patterns. Building on these insights, we propose a rule-driven routing framework. A routing agent scores candidate augmentation paths based on explicit rules and selects the most suitable one; a rule-making expert agent refines the rules over time using QA feedback to maintain adaptability; and a path-level meta-cache reuses past routing decisions for semantically similar queries to reduce latency and cost. Experiments on three QA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms static strategies and learned routing baselines, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining moderate computational cost.

Summary:  
The paper introduces KnowledgeSmith, a framework that aims to understand the knowledge updating mechanism of large language models (LLMs) through knowledge editing and unlearning. It frames editing and unlearning as instances of a single optimization problem and provides an automatic dataset generator for structured interventions at multiple graph levels and data scales. The experiments conducted reveal insights into knowledge propagation, plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness of LLMs. The results show that LLMs do not update knowledge in a manner similar to humans across different knowledge levels and highlight the existence of a consistency-capacity trade-off. These findings could potentially inform the development of more reliable and scalable strategies for knowledge updating in LLMs.

arXiv:2510.02392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge editing and machine unlearning are two popular approaches for large language models (LLMs) to stay up-to-date. However, the knowledge updating mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and small-scale evaluation. For instance, are LLMs similar to humans in modifying certain knowledge? What differs editing and unlearning as training data increases? This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation, plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off. We hope our findings can offer suggestions to the design of more reliable and scalable strategies. Code: https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/KnowledgeSmith.git

Summary:<br /><br />
The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in translating Natural Language (NL) queries into SQL varies greatly depending on the database. NL queries often use domain specific vocabulary, making it challenging to map them to the correct SQL without understanding the domain expressions and their relationship to the database schema. Existing benchmarks rely on unrealistic textual hints for expressing domain knowledge, but this paper proposes a systematic framework for associating structured domain statements at the database level. By retrieving relevant structured domain statements using sub-string matching, the approach is found to be more practical and accurate than ad-hoc query-specific textual hints. The evaluation on eleven diverse database schemas across various domains shows that the sub-string matching retrieval method yields significantly higher accuracy compared to other approaches. <div>

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) for translating Natural Language (NL) queries into SQL varies significantly across databases (DBs). NL queries are often expressed using a domain specific vocabulary, and mapping these to the correct SQL requires an understanding of the embedded domain expressions, their relationship to the DB schema structure. Existing benchmarks rely on unrealistic, ad-hoc query specific textual hints for expressing domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for associating structured domain statements at the database level. We present retrieval of relevant structured domain statements given a user query using sub-string level match. We evaluate on eleven realistic DB schemas covering diverse domains across five open-source and proprietary LLMs and demonstrate that (1) DB level structured domain statements are more practical and accurate than existing ad-hoc query specific textual domain statements, and (2) Our sub-string match based retrieval of relevant domain statements provides significantly higher accuracy than other retrieval approaches.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) trained solely on text data can acquire implicit multimodal knowledge embedded in language. The study explores how explicit sensory prompts can activate latent visual and auditory representations in text-trained LLMs. By instructing the model to 'see' or 'hear', the prompts guide the model to generate predictions as if based on visual or auditory information. Results demonstrate that simple prompt adjustments can effectively engage modality-specific representations in text-based LLMs, enhancing alignment with specialized vision and audio models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained purely on text ostensibly lack any direct perceptual experience, yet their internal representations are implicitly shaped by multimodal regularities encoded in language. We test the hypothesis that explicit sensory prompting can surface this latent structure, bringing a text-only LLM into closer representational alignment with specialist vision and audio encoders. When a sensory prompt tells the model to 'see' or 'hear', it cues the model to resolve its next-token predictions as if they were conditioned on latent visual or auditory evidence that is never actually supplied. Our findings reveal that lightweight prompt engineering can reliably activate modality-appropriate representations in purely text-trained LLMs.

<div> framework, language models, syntax acquisition, probabilistic context-free grammars, learning dynamics
Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework for understanding how language models learn syntax, focusing on probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) that capture various domains. By studying small models trained on synthetic languages from PCFGs, the authors derive formulae for training loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Unlike children, models reduce loss across all subgrammars simultaneously, rather than mastering simple structures first. Subgrammar pretraining improves final loss for smaller models and aligns internal representations with the grammar's substructure. Models struggle with deep recursive structures, highlighting challenges in representing hierarchical syntax. This research paves the way for studying transformer learning dynamics on PCFGs as a versatile testbed for exploring language model learning, sparking new research directions and questions. 
Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce a new framework for understanding how language models acquire syntax. While large models achieve impressive results, little is known about their learning dynamics. Our approach starts with the observation that most domains of interest, such as natural language syntax, coding languages, arithmetic problems, are captured by probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs). We study the learning dynamics of small models trained on synthetic languages generated from PCFGs, enabling precise control over grammar complexity, recursion depth, and subgrammar structure. We prove several general, recursive formulae for the training loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence over the subgrammar structure of a PCFG. Empirically, we find that unlike children, who first master simple substructures before progressing to more complex constructions, transformers reduce loss across all subgrammars in parallel. We further show that subgrammar pretraining can improve the final loss for smaller models, and that pretrained models develop internal representations more aligned with the grammar's substructure. Finally, we demonstrate that models struggle with deeper recursive structures (a limitation even of large language models), revealing fundamental challenges in how neural networks represent hierarchical syntax. Overall, our work initiates the study of the learning dynamics of transformers on PCFGs as a versatile testbed for probing learning in language models, opening a research direction with many open questions.

Summary: 
Neural document retrieval often overlooks corpus structure, resulting in opaque explanations. This study introduces a novel approach using the Cobweb framework to organize sentence embeddings into a prototype tree, enabling ranking documents through coarse-to-fine traversal. The internal nodes of the hierarchy serve as concept prototypes, offering multi-granular relevance signals and transparent retrieval paths. Two inference methods, best-first search and path-sum ranker, are implemented and evaluated on datasets with various embeddings. The results demonstrate that the novel retrieval approaches match traditional methods with strong encoder embeddings and exhibit robustness with lower-quality embeddings. Notably, the approach remains effective and interpretable, showcasing competitive performance, robustness, scalability, and transparent retrieval via hierarchical prototypes.

Abstract: Neural document retrieval often treats a corpus as a flat cloud of vectors scored at a single granularity, leaving corpus structure underused and explanations opaque. We use Cobweb--a hierarchy-aware framework--to organize sentence embeddings into a prototype tree and rank documents via coarse-to-fine traversal. Internal nodes act as concept prototypes, providing multi-granular relevance signals and a transparent rationale through retrieval paths. We instantiate two inference approaches: a generalized best-first search and a lightweight path-sum ranker. We evaluate our approaches on MS MARCO and QQP with encoder (e.g., BERT/T5) and decoder (GPT-2) representations. Our results show that our retrieval approaches match the dot product search on strong encoder embeddings while remaining robust when kNN degrades: with GPT-2 vectors, dot product performance collapses whereas our approaches still retrieve relevant results. Overall, our experiments suggest that Cobweb provides competitive effectiveness, improved robustness to embedding quality, scalability, and interpretable retrieval via hierarchical prototypes.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in text generation and dialog systems. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a key application of LLMs, improving generated content reliability. Evaluating RAG systems is challenging due to traditional metrics' limitations. Building on the RAGAS tool, a KG-based evaluation approach enables multi-hop reasoning and semantic clustering for more comprehensive scoring. Comparing this method with RAGAS and human annotations shows better sensitivity to semantic nuances in outputs. The study highlights the need for improved evaluation methods for RAG systems and suggests future research directions. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) has become a significant research focus and is utilized in various fields, such as text generation and dialog systems. One of the most essential applications of LLM is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which greatly enhances generated content's reliability and relevance. However, evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness. Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated outputs. Finally, we discuss the key challenges in evaluating RAG systems and highlight potential directions for future research.

Summary:  
Spoken language models (SLMs) integrate speech with large language models (LMs) using modality adapters (MAs) to map speech encoder output for decoder LM understanding. This study analyzes MA output representations in three SLMs—SALMONN, Qwen2-Audio, Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct—to uncover transformation strategies. MAs in Whisper encoder models display an interlingua-based approach, capturing input meaning comprehensible across languages. In contrast, models like Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct without Whisper encoder focus on phonetic representation in English words. The distinction suggests MAs encode input semantics differently based on speech encoder training for recognition or translation tasks. Understanding these strategies enhances the design and performance of SLMs for multilingual and multimodal applications.  
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) that integrate speech with large language models (LMs) rely on modality adapters (MAs) to map the output of speech encoders to a representation that is understandable to the decoder LM. Yet we know very little about how these crucial MAs transform representations. Here we examine the MA output representation in three SLMs (SALMONN, Qwen2-Audio and Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct). By finding the nearest decoder LM token to an MA representation, we uncover two strategies for MA representations. For models using a Whisper encoder, MAs appear to represent the meaning of the input using an English-based interlingua, allowing them to handle languages unseen in instruction tuning. For models that don't, like Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct, MAs instead represent the phonetics of the input, but expressed with English words. We hypothesise that which arises depends on whether the speech encoder is trained only for speech recognition or also for translation.

Summary:
The study focuses on the evaluation of Highlight explanations (HEs) in explaining context utilization in Language Models (LMs). A gold standard HE evaluation framework was introduced to assess the effectiveness of HE methods in attributing context. The evaluation involved four HE methods, four context scenarios, four datasets, and five LMs. MechLight, a mechanistic interpretability approach, emerged as the best-performing method across all context scenarios. However, all methods faced challenges with longer contexts and exhibited positional biases. These findings highlight the need for new approaches to deliver reliable explanations for context utilization at scale. The study provides valuable insights into the opacity of context utilization in LMs and emphasizes the importance of accurate explanation frameworks in understanding model behavior. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.02629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context utilisation, the ability of Language Models (LMs) to incorporate relevant information from the provided context when generating responses, remains largely opaque to users, who cannot determine whether models draw from parametric memory or provided context, nor identify which specific context pieces inform the response. Highlight explanations (HEs) offer a natural solution as they can point the exact context pieces and tokens that influenced model outputs. However, no existing work evaluates their effectiveness in accurately explaining context utilisation. We address this gap by introducing the first gold standard HE evaluation framework for context attribution, using controlled test cases with known ground-truth context usage, which avoids the limitations of existing indirect proxy evaluations. To demonstrate the framework's broad applicability, we evaluate four HE methods -- three established techniques and MechLight, a mechanistic interpretability approach we adapt for this task -- across four context scenarios, four datasets, and five LMs. Overall, we find that MechLight performs best across all context scenarios. However, all methods struggle with longer contexts and exhibit positional biases, pointing to fundamental challenges in explanation accuracy that require new approaches to deliver reliable context utilisation explanations at scale.

Summary: 
This study explores how users interact differently with Large Language Models (LLMs) compared to human agents, uncovering significant differences in communication styles such as grammatical fluency, politeness, and lexical diversity. The findings suggest that LLMs may struggle to adapt to the shift in communication style when deployed as chatbots. To address this, the researchers experimented with data augmentation post-training and user message reformulation at inference time. Models trained on stylistically diverse datasets performed better than those trained on uniform datasets, highlighting the importance of incorporating varied communication styles in LLM training. However, inference-time reformulation showed less effectiveness in improving model performance. These insights are crucial for enhancing the robustness of LLMs in user interactions, ultimately leading to improved user experiences with chatbots.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in customer-facing applications, a critical yet underexplored question is how users communicate differently with LLM chatbots compared to human agent. In this study, we present empirical evidence that users adopt distinct communication styles when users interact with chatbots versus human agents. Our analysis reveals significant differences in grammatical fluency, politeness, and lexical diversity in user language between the two settings. These findings suggest that models trained exclusively on human-human interaction data may not adequately accommodate the communication style shift that occurs once an LLM chatbot is deployed. To enhance LLM robustness to post-launch communication style changes, we experimented with two strategies: (1) data augmentation during the post-training phase and (2) inference-time user message reformulation. Our results indicate that models trained on stylistically diverse datasets significantly outperform those trained exclusively on original or stylistically uniform datasets, while inference-time reformulation proved less effective. These insights help us to better adapt our models for improved LLM-user interaction experiences.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a novel training-free method that enhances multilingual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). It achieves this by Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge Transformation, converting language-specific semantic information into language-agnostic structured representations. SoT enables models to better understand queries in different languages and guides LLMs to maintain consistent reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations. Experimental results show that SoT surpasses strong baselines on various multilingual reasoning benchmarks, across different LLM backbones. It can also be combined with other training-free strategies for additional enhancements. The code for SoT is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.  <div>

Abstract: Recent developments have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to engage in complex reasoning tasks through deep thinking. However, the capacity of reasoning has not been successfully transferred to non-high-resource languages due to resource constraints, which struggles with multilingual reasoning tasks. To this end, we propose Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a training-free method that improves the performance on multilingual reasoning through a multi-step transformation: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge Transformation. The SoT method converts language-specific semantic information into language-agnostic structured representations, enabling the models to understand the query in different languages more sophisticated. Besides, SoT effectively guides LLMs toward more concentrated reasoning to maintain consistent underlying reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations in expression. Experimental results demonstrate that SoT outperforms several strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks when adapting to various backbones of LLMs. It can also be integrated with other training-free strategies for further improvements. Our code is available at https://github.com/Cherry-qwq/SoT.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) research has primarily focused on closed-book factual question answering (QA), while contextual QA remains unexplored, despite its importance in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on UQ for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic, token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution. By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance (using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty (avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised (sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a 13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead.

Summary:
This article explores the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-turn dialogues through survival analysis. By analyzing 36,951 conversation turns across 9 LLMs, the study models failure as a time-to-event process. The analysis reveals that abrupt semantic drift between prompts significantly increases the risk of conversational failure, while gradual drift acts as a protective factor, allowing for longer dialogues. Models incorporating interactions demonstrate superior performance in predicting failure events. This research highlights the importance of temporal dynamics in evaluating LLMs' robustness, challenges the necessity of semantic consistency in conversational AI systems, and provides insights for designing more resilient conversational agents. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized conversational AI, yet their robustness in extended multi-turn dialogues remains poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks focus on static benchmarks and single-turn assessments, failing to capture the temporal dynamics of conversational degradation that characterize real-world interactions. In this work, we present the first comprehensive survival analysis of conversational AI robustness, analyzing 36,951 conversation turns across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs to model failure as a time-to-event process. Our survival modeling framework-employing Cox proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest approaches-reveals extraordinary temporal dynamics. We find that abrupt, prompt-to-prompt(P2P) semantic drift is catastrophic, dramatically increasing the hazard of conversational failure. In stark contrast, gradual, cumulative drift is highly protective, vastly reducing the failure hazard and enabling significantly longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions demonstrate superior performance, achieving excellent discrimination and exceptional calibration. These findings establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm for evaluating LLM robustness, offer concrete insights for designing resilient conversational agents, and challenge prevailing assumptions about the necessity of semantic consistency in conversational AI Systems.

Abstract: Results on existing LLM benchmarks capture little information over the model capabilities in low-resource tasks, making it difficult to develop effective solutions in these domains. To address these challenges, we curated 14 travel-domain datasets spanning 7 common NLP tasks using anonymised data from real-world scenarios, and analysed the performance across LLMs. We report on the accuracy, scaling behaviour, and reasoning capabilities of LLMs in a variety of tasks. Our results confirm that general benchmarking results are insufficient for understanding model performance in low-resource tasks. Despite the amount of training FLOPs, out-of-the-box LLMs hit performance bottlenecks in complex, domain-specific scenarios. Furthermore, reasoning provides a more significant boost for smaller LLMs by making the model a better judge on certain tasks.

Abstract: The task of entity linking, which involves associating mentions with their respective entities in a knowledge graph, has received significant attention due to its numerous potential applications. Recently, various multimodal entity linking (MEL) techniques have been proposed, targeted to learn comprehensive embeddings by leveraging both text and vision modalities. The selection of high-quality negative samples can potentially play a crucial role in metric/representation learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, this possibility remains unexplored in existing literature within the framework of MEL. To fill this gap, we address the multimodal entity linking problem in a generative adversarial setting where the generator is responsible for generating high-quality negative samples, and the discriminator is assigned the responsibility for the metric learning tasks. Since the generator is involved in generating samples, which is a discrete process, we optimize it using policy gradient techniques and propose a policy gradient-based generative adversarial network for multimodal entity linking (PGMEL). Experimental results based on Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate that PGMEL learns meaningful representation by selecting challenging negative samples and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across critical domains owing to their impressive contextual understanding and generative capabilities. However, their increasing deployment in high stakes applications necessitates rigorous evaluation of embedded biases, particularly in culturally diverse contexts like India where existing embedding-based bias assessment methods often fall short in capturing nuanced stereotypes. We propose an evaluation framework based on a encoder trained using contrastive learning that captures fine-grained bias through embedding similarity. We also introduce a novel dataset - IndiCASA (IndiBias-based Contextually Aligned Stereotypes and Anti-stereotypes) comprising 2,575 human-validated sentences spanning five demographic axes: caste, gender, religion, disability, and socioeconomic status. Our evaluation of multiple open-weight LLMs reveals that all models exhibit some degree of stereotypical bias, with disability related biases being notably persistent, and religion bias generally lower likely due to global debiasing efforts demonstrating the need for fairer model development.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but such training typically demands substantial efforts in creating and annotating data. In this work, we explore improving LLMs through RL with minimal data. Our approach alternates between the LLM proposing a task and then attempting to solve it. To minimize data dependency, we introduce two novel mechanisms grounded in self-awareness: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, where the model learns to assess task difficulty relative to its own abilities and prioritize challenging yet solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, where the model recognizes when a task is beyond its capability boundary and proactively requests external data to break through that limit. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks showing a 53.8% relative improvement with less than 1.2% extra data demonstrate the efficacy of self-aware RL and underscore the promise of self-evolving agent training.

Abstract: Cross-lingual topic modeling aims to uncover shared semantic themes across languages. Several methods have been proposed to address this problem, leveraging both traditional and neural approaches. While previous methods have achieved some improvements in topic diversity, they often struggle to ensure high topic coherence and consistent alignment across languages. We propose XTRA (Cross-Lingual Topic Modeling with Topic and Representation Alignments), a novel framework that unifies Bag-of-Words modeling with multilingual embeddings. XTRA introduces two core components: (1) representation alignment, aligning document-topic distributions via contrastive learning in a shared semantic space; and (2) topic alignment, projecting topic-word distributions into the same space to enforce crosslingual consistency. This dual mechanism enables XTRA to learn topics that are interpretable (coherent and diverse) and well-aligned across languages. Experiments on multilingual corpora confirm that XTRA significantly outperforms strong baselines in topic coherence, diversity, and alignment quality. Code and reproducible scripts are available at https: //github.com/tienphat140205/XTRA.

<title>A Computational Framework for Interpretable Text-Based Personality Assessment from Social Media</title>

Abstract: Personality refers to individual differences in behavior, thinking, and feeling. With the growing availability of digital footprints, especially from social media, automated methods for personality assessment have become increasingly important. Natural language processing (NLP) enables the analysis of unstructured text data to identify personality indicators. However, two main challenges remain central to this thesis: the scarcity of large, personality-labeled datasets and the disconnect between personality psychology and NLP, which restricts model validity and interpretability. To address these challenges, this thesis presents two datasets -- MBTI9k and PANDORA -- collected from Reddit, a platform known for user anonymity and diverse discussions. The PANDORA dataset contains 17 million comments from over 10,000 users and integrates the MBTI and Big Five personality models with demographic information, overcoming limitations in data size, quality, and label coverage. Experiments on these datasets show that demographic variables influence model validity. In response, the SIMPA (Statement-to-Item Matching Personality Assessment) framework was developed - a computational framework for interpretable personality assessment that matches user-generated statements with validated questionnaire items. By using machine learning and semantic similarity, SIMPA delivers personality assessments comparable to human evaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency. Although focused on personality assessment, SIMPA's versatility extends beyond this domain. Its model-agnostic design, layered cue detection, and scalability make it suitable for various research and practical applications involving complex label taxonomies and variable cue associations with target concepts.

<title>StepChain GraphRAG: Reasoning Over Knowledge Graphs for Multi-Hop Question Answering</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02827</link>

Abstract: Recent progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has led to more accurate and interpretable multi-hop question answering (QA). Yet, challenges persist in integrating iterative reasoning steps with external knowledge retrieval. To address this, we introduce StepChain GraphRAG, a framework that unites question decomposition with a Breadth-First Search (BFS) Reasoning Flow for enhanced multi-hop QA. Our approach first builds a global index over the corpus; at inference time, only retrieved passages are parsed on-the-fly into a knowledge graph, and the complex query is split into sub-questions. For each sub-question, a BFS-based traversal dynamically expands along relevant edges, assembling explicit evidence chains without overwhelming the language model with superfluous context. Experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA show that StepChain GraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art Exact Match and F1 scores. StepChain GraphRAG lifts average EM by 2.57% and F1 by 2.13% over the SOTA method, achieving the largest gain on HotpotQA (+4.70% EM, +3.44% F1). StepChain GraphRAG also fosters enhanced explainability by preserving the chain-of-thought across intermediate retrieval steps. We conclude by discussing how future work can mitigate the computational overhead and address potential hallucinations from large language models to refine efficiency and reliability in multi-hop QA.

<title>Evaluating Large Language Models for IUCN Red List Species Information</title>

arXiv:2510.02830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted in conservation to address the biodiversity crisis, yet their reliability for species evaluation is uncertain. This study systematically validates five leading models on 21,955 species across four core IUCN Red List assessment components: taxonomy, conservation status, distribution, and threats. A critical paradox was revealed: models excelled at taxonomic classification (94.9%) but consistently failed at conservation reasoning (27.2% for status assessment). This knowledge-reasoning gap, evident across all models, suggests inherent architectural constraints, not just data limitations. Furthermore, models exhibited systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates, potentially amplifying existing conservation inequities. These findings delineate clear boundaries for responsible LLM deployment: they are powerful tools for information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions. A hybrid approach is recommended, where LLMs augment expert capacity while human experts retain sole authority over risk assessment and policy.

Abstract: Wordle presents an algorithmically rich testbed for constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) solving. While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint treatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with novel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy, computing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw candidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian word-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315 English words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9% success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward Checking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3 percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates 88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from linguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration, robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for structured puzzle-solving domains.

<title>Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02919</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02919</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.02919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve complex reasoning tasks via long chain-of-thought, but their forward-only autoregressive generation process is fragile; early token errors can cascade, which creates a clear need for self-reflection mechanisms. However, existing self-reflection either performs revisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training, both fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time framework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token generation, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify high-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific corrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a self-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By retrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more trustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors at highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model reasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger self-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a plug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for reliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and broad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g., SLOT) techniques.

Abstract: We present the Conversational Data Retrieval (CDR) benchmark, the first comprehensive test set for evaluating systems that retrieve conversation data for product insights. With 1.6k queries across five analytical tasks and 9.1k conversations, our benchmark provides a reliable standard for measuring conversational data retrieval performance. Our evaluation of 16 popular embedding models shows that even the best models reach only around NDCG@10 of 0.51, revealing a substantial gap between document and conversational data retrieval capabilities. Our work identifies unique challenges in conversational data retrieval (implicit state recognition, turn dynamics, contextual references) while providing practical query templates and detailed error analysis across different task categories. The benchmark dataset and code are available at https://github.com/l-yohai/CDR-Benchmark.

<title>Leave No TRACE: Black-box Detection of Copyrighted Dataset Usage in Large Language Models via Watermarking</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02962</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.02962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly fine-tuned on smaller, domain-specific datasets to improve downstream performance. These datasets often contain proprietary or copyrighted material, raising the need for reliable safeguards against unauthorized use. Existing membership inference attacks (MIAs) and dataset-inference methods typically require access to internal signals such as logits, while current black-box approaches often rely on handcrafted prompts or a clean reference dataset for calibration, both of which limit practical applicability. Watermarking is a promising alternative, but prior techniques can degrade text quality or reduce task performance. We propose TRACE, a practical framework for fully black-box detection of copyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning. \texttt{TRACE} rewrites datasets with distortion-free watermarks guided by a private key, ensuring both text quality and downstream utility. At detection time, we exploit the radioactivity effect of fine-tuning on watermarked data and introduce an entropy-gated procedure that selectively scores high-uncertainty tokens, substantially amplifying detection power. Across diverse datasets and model families, TRACE consistently achieves significant detections (p<0.05), often with extremely strong statistical evidence. Furthermore, it supports multi-dataset attribution and remains robust even after continued pretraining on large non-watermarked corpora. These results establish TRACE as a practical route to reliable black-box verification of copyrighted dataset usage. We will make our code available at: https://github.com/NusIoraPrivacy/TRACE.

<title>Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical Evidence: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation System for Querying UK NICE Clinical Guidelines</title>

arXiv:2510.02967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for querying the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines using Large Language Models (LLMs). The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was evaluated against a database of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries.
  The most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context Precision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability to prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source material. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling cost-effective access to medical guidelines.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is essential for improving human-computer interaction, yet its accuracy remains constrained by the complexity of emotional nuances in speech. In this study, we distinguish between descriptive semantics, which represents the contextual content of speech, and expressive semantics, which reflects the speaker's emotional state. After watching emotionally charged movie segments, we recorded audio clips of participants describing their experiences, along with the intended emotion tags for each clip, participants' self-rated emotional responses, and their valence/arousal scores. Through experiments, we show that descriptive semantics align with intended emotions, while expressive semantics correlate with evoked emotions. Our findings inform SER applications in human-AI interaction and pave the way for more context-aware AI systems.

<title>Revisiting Direct Speech-to-Text Translation with Speech LLMs: Better Scaling than CoT Prompting?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work on Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) has focused on LLM-based models, introducing the increasingly adopted Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, where the model is guided to first transcribe the speech and then translate it. CoT typically outperforms direct prompting primarily because it can exploit abundant Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT) datasets to explicitly model its steps. In this paper, we systematically compare CoT and Direct prompting under increasing amounts of S2TT data. To this end, we pseudo-label an ASR corpus by translating its transcriptions into six European languages, and train LLM-based S2TT systems with both prompting strategies at different data scales. Our results show that Direct improves more consistently as the amount of data increases, suggesting that it may become a more effective approach as larger S2TT resources are created.

<title>Semantic Similarity in Radiology Reports via LLMs and NER</title>

Abstract: Radiology report evaluation is a crucial part of radiologists' training and plays a key role in ensuring diagnostic accuracy. As part of the standard reporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary report, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce the final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and final reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to help uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly growing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains challenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge. In this paper, we explore the ability of LLMs to provide explainable and accurate comparisons of reports in the radiology domain. We begin by comparing the performance of several LLMs in comparing radiology reports. We then assess a more traditional approach based on Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). However, both approaches exhibit limitations in delivering accurate feedback on semantic similarity. To address this, we propose Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method using a combination of Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to emphasise or de-emphasise specific types of differences. Our approach generates a quantitative similarity score for tracking progress and also gives an interpretation of the score that aims to offer valuable guidance in reviewing and refining their reporting. We find our method achieves 67% exact-match accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/- 1 when compared to radiologist-provided ground truth scores - outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently.

Abstract: Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) systems built from Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT) modules face two major limitations: error propagation and the inability to exploit prosodic or other acoustic cues. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has recently been introduced, with the expectation that jointly accessing speech and transcription will overcome these issues. Analyzing CoT through attribution methods, robustness evaluations with corrupted transcripts, and prosody-awareness, we find that it largely mirrors cascaded behavior, relying mainly on transcripts while barely leveraging speech. Simple training interventions, such as adding Direct S2TT data or noisy transcript injection, enhance robustness and increase speech attribution. These findings challenge the assumed advantages of CoT and highlight the need for architectures that explicitly integrate acoustic information into translation.

Abstract: Academic survey writing, which distills vast literature into a coherent and insightful narrative, remains a labor-intensive and intellectually demanding task. While recent approaches, such as general DeepResearch agents and survey-specialized methods, can generate surveys automatically (a.k.a. LLM4Survey), their outputs often fall short of human standards and there lacks a rigorous, reader-aligned benchmark for thoroughly revealing their deficiencies. To fill the gap, we propose a fine-grained, quiz-driven evaluation framework SurveyBench, featuring (1) typical survey topics source from recent 11,343 arXiv papers and corresponding 4,947 high-quality surveys; (2) a multifaceted metric hierarchy that assesses the outline quality (e.g., coverage breadth, logical coherence), content quality (e.g., synthesis granularity, clarity of insights), and non-textual richness; and (3) a dual-mode evaluation protocol that includes content-based and quiz-based answerability tests, explicitly aligned with readers' informational needs. Results show SurveyBench effectively challenges existing LLM4Survey approaches (e.g., on average 21% lower than human in content-based evaluation).

Abstract: Confidence calibration, the alignment of a model's predicted confidence with its actual accuracy, is crucial for the reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this critical property remains largely under-explored in multilingual contexts. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale, systematic studies of multilingual calibration across six model families and over 100 languages, revealing that non-English languages suffer from systematically worse calibration. To diagnose this, we investigate the model's internal representations and find that the final layer, biased by English-centric training, provides a poor signal for multilingual confidence. In contrast, our layer-wise analysis uncovers a key insight that late-intermediate layers consistently offer a more reliable and better-calibrated signal. Building on this, we introduce a suite of training-free methods, including Language-Aware Confidence Ensemble (LACE), which adaptively selects an optimal ensemble of layers for each specific language. Our study highlights the hidden costs of English-centric alignment and offer a new path toward building more globally equitable and trustworthy LLMs by looking beyond the final layer.

arXiv:2510.03154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant proportion of queries to large language models ask them to edit user-provided text, rather than generate new text from scratch. While previous work focuses on detecting fully AI-generated text, we demonstrate that AI-edited text is distinguishable from human-written and AI-generated text. First, we propose using lightweight similarity metrics to quantify the magnitude of AI editing present in a text given the original human-written text and validate these metrics with human annotators. Using these similarity metrics as intermediate supervision, we then train EditLens, a regression model that predicts the amount of AI editing present within a text. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both binary (F1=94.7%) and ternary (F1=90.4%) classification tasks in distinguishing human, AI, and mixed writing. Not only do we show that AI-edited text can be detected, but also that the degree of change made by AI to human writing can be detected, which has implications for authorship attribution, education, and policy. Finally, as a case study, we use our model to analyze the effects of AI-edits applied by Grammarly, a popular writing assistance tool. To encourage further research, we commit to publicly releasing our models and dataset.

Abstract: Previous work has shown correlations between the hidden states of large language models and fMRI brain responses, on language tasks. These correlations have been taken as evidence of the representational similarity of these models and brain states. This study tests whether these previous results are robust to several possible concerns. Specifically this study shows: (i) that the previous results are still found after dimensionality reduction, and thus are not attributable to the curse of dimensionality; (ii) that previous results are confirmed when using new measures of similarity; (iii) that correlations between brain representations and those from models are specific to models trained on human language; and (iv) that the results are dependent on the presence of positional encoding in the models. These results confirm and strengthen the results of previous research and contribute to the debate on the biological plausibility and interpretability of state-of-the-art large language models.

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as neural topic models rely on inference and generation networks to learn latent topic distributions. This paper explores a new paradigm for topic modeling in the era of large language models, framing TM as a long-form generation task whose definition is updated in this paradigm. We propose a simple but practical approach to implement LLM-based topic model tasks out of the box (sample a data subset, generate topics and representative text with our prompt, text assignment with keyword match). We then investigate whether the long-form generation paradigm can beat NTMs via zero-shot prompting. We conduct a systematic comparison between NTMs and LLMs in terms of topic quality and empirically examine the claim that "a majority of NTMs are outdated."

Abstract: We present NN-Rank, an algorithm for ranking source languages for cross-lingual transfer, which leverages hidden representations from multilingual models and unlabeled target-language data. We experiment with two pretrained multilingual models and two tasks: part-of-speech tagging (POS) and named entity recognition (NER). We consider 51 source languages and evaluate on 56 and 72 target languages for POS and NER, respectively. When using in-domain data, NN-Rank beats state-of-the-art baselines that leverage lexical and linguistic features, with average improvements of up to 35.56 NDCG for POS and 18.14 NDCG for NER. As prior approaches can fall back to language-level features if target language data is not available, we show that NN-Rank remains competitive using only the Bible, an out-of-domain corpus available for a large number of languages. Ablations on the amount of unlabeled target data show that, for subsets consisting of as few as 25 examples, NN-Rank produces high-quality rankings which achieve 92.8% of the NDCG achieved using all available target data for ranking.

This saturates context limits and increases computational cost processing; moreover, processing full pages exposes agents to security risks such as prompt injection. Existing pruning strategies either discard relevant content or retain irrelevant context, leading to suboptimal action prediction. We introduce FocusAgent, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from accessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. By pruning noisy and irrelevant content, FocusAgent enables efficient reasoning while reducing vulnerability to injection attacks. Experiments on WorkArena and WebArena benchmarks show that FocusAgent matches the performance of strong baselines, while reducing observation size by over 50%. Furthermore, a variant of FocusAgent significantly reduces the success rate of prompt-injection attacks, including banner and pop-up attacks, while maintaining task success performance in attack-free settings. Our results highlight that targeted LLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents that are efficient, effective, and secure.

<title>Cache-to-Cache: Direct Semantic Communication Between Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size, supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus, we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5% higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average 2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/C2C.

Abstract: To solve complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), prompting-based methods offer a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. However, as reasoning chains extend, critical intermediate steps and the original prompt will be buried in the context, receiving insufficient attention and leading to errors. In this paper, we propose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline that leverages the inherent structure of reasoning to steer LLM attention. Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories into structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to the most relevant inference steps, allowing the model to maintain focus throughout generation. Our experiment shows that Self-Anchor outperforms SOTA prompting methods across six benchmarks. Notably, Self-Anchor significantly reduces the performance gap between ``non-reasoning'' models and specialized reasoning models, with the potential to enable most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning tasks without retraining.

Abstract: The emergence of reinforcement learning in post-training of large language models has sparked significant interest in reward models. Reward models assess the quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is also performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI model. We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to redundant terminology and repeated pitfalls. Common challenges include susceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking, methods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our position paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help overcome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward models on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas. Grounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer alignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference elicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and calibration-aware meta-evaluation.

Abstract: The growth of highly advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) constitutes a huge dual-use problem, making it necessary to create dependable AI-generated text detection systems. Modern detectors are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial attacks, with paraphrasing standing out as an effective evasion technique that foils statistical detection. This paper presents a comparative study of adversarial robustness, first by quantifying the limitations of standard adversarial training and then by introducing a novel, significantly more resilient detection framework: Perturbation-Invariant Feature Engineering (PIFE), a framework that enhances detection by first transforming input text into a standardized form using a multi-stage normalization pipeline, it then quantifies the transformation's magnitude using metrics like Levenshtein distance and semantic similarity, feeding these signals directly to the classifier. We evaluate both a conventionally hardened Transformer and our PIFE-augmented model against a hierarchical taxonomy of character-, word-, and sentence-level attacks. Our findings first confirm that conventional adversarial training, while resilient to syntactic noise, fails against semantic attacks, an effect we term "semantic evasion threshold", where its True Positive Rate at a strict 1% False Positive Rate plummets to 48.8%. In stark contrast, our PIFE model, which explicitly engineers features from the discrepancy between a text and its canonical form, overcomes this limitation. It maintains a remarkable 82.6% TPR under the same conditions, effectively neutralizing the most sophisticated semantic attacks. This superior performance demonstrates that explicitly modeling perturbation artifacts, rather than merely training on them, is a more promising path toward achieving genuine robustness in the adversarial arms race.

Abstract: The advancement of computational psychology requires AI tools capable of deeply understanding counseling dialogues. Existing audio language models (AudioLLMs) often rely on single speech encoders pre-trained on general data, struggling to capture domain-specific features like complex emotions and professional techniques. To address this, we propose WEE-Therapy, a multi-task AudioLLM incorporating a Weak Encoder Ensemble (WEE) mechanism. This supplements a powerful base encoder with a pool of lightweight, specialized encoders. A novel dual-routing strategy combines stable, data-independent domain knowledge with dynamic, data-dependent expert selection. Evaluated on emotion recognition, technique classification, risk detection, and summarization, WEE-Therapy achieves significant performance gains across all tasks with minimal parameter overhead, demonstrating strong potential for AI-assisted clinical analysis.

Abstract: Spoken communication plays a central role in clinical workflows. In radiology, for example, most reports are created through dictation. Yet, nearly all medical AI systems rely exclusively on written text. In this work, we address this gap by exploring the feasibility of learning visual-language representations directly from spoken radiology reports. Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale dataset (Speech-RATE) of spoken radiology reports and train SpeechCT-CLIP, a contrastive model that aligns speech and 3D CT volumes in a shared representation space. While naive speech-based models underperform compared to text-trained counterparts, we show that knowledge distillation from a pretrained text-image CLIP model effectively transfers semantic alignment capabilities from text to speech, substantially narrowing this gap. Experiments demonstrate improved zero-shot classification F1 from 0.623 to 0.705, recovering 88% of the performance difference, and strong retrieval results without requiring text at inference. These findings highlight speech as a practical alternative to text in multimodal pretraining and open the door to voice-driven diagnostic support tools in clinical practice.

Abstract: Watermarking algorithms for Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively identify machine-generated content by embedding and detecting hidden statistical features in text. However, such embedding leads to a decline in text quality, especially in low-entropy scenarios where performance needs improvement. Existing methods that rely on entropy thresholds often require significant computational resources for tuning and demonstrate poor adaptability to unknown or cross-task generation scenarios. We propose \textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{T}hreshold watermarking ($\myalgo$), a novel framework that dynamically adjusts watermarking intensity based on real-time semantic context. $\myalgo$ partitions text generation into semantic states using logits clustering, establishing context-aware entropy thresholds that preserve fidelity in structured content while embedding robust watermarks. Crucially, it requires no pre-defined thresholds or task-specific tuning. Experiments show $\myalgo$ improves text quality in cross-tasks without sacrificing detection accuracy.

<title>How to Train Your Advisor: Steering Black-Box LLMs with Advisor Models</title>

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly deployed as black-box services, where model weights cannot be modified and customization is limited to prompting. While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.

Abstract: Driving scene manipulation with sensor data is emerging as a promising alternative to traditional virtual driving simulators. However, existing frameworks struggle to generate realistic scenarios efficiently due to limited editing capabilities. To address these challenges, we present SIMSplat, a predictive driving scene editor with language-aligned Gaussian splatting. As a language-controlled editor, SIMSplat enables intuitive manipulation using natural language prompts. By aligning language with Gaussian-reconstructed scenes, it further supports direct querying of road objects, allowing precise and flexible editing. Our method provides detailed object-level editing, including adding new objects and modifying the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians, while also incorporating predictive path refinement through multi-agent motion prediction to generate realistic interactions among all agents in the scene. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate SIMSplat's extensive editing capabilities and adaptability across a wide range of scenarios. Project page: https://sungyeonparkk.github.io/simsplat/

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) is plagued by long training times and massive energy consumption, with modern models requiring months of computation and gigawatt-hours of electricity. In light of these challenges,we introduce Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and $55\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters. These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.

<title>Beyond Imitation: Recovering Dense Rewards from Demonstrations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Conventionally, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is treated as a simple imitation learning process that only trains a policy to imitate expert behavior on demonstration datasets. In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert demonstrations.

Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities, spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate, producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns. To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can improve reasoning at inference time through test-time scaling (TTS), where multiple reasoning traces are generated and the best one is selected. Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces. Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3 (0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning (RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent potential of base models.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), especially Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), has emerged as a promising approach to fine-tuning large language models(LLMs) while reducing computational and memory overhead. However, LoRA assumes a uniform rank \textit{r} for each incremental matrix, not accounting for the varying significance of weight matrices across different modules and layers. AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value Decomposition $(P, \Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without sacrificing performance. Additionally, further extension experiments on other LoRA-based approaches validate the broad applicability of our method.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) couples document retrieval with large language models (LLMs). While scaling generators improves accuracy, it also raises cost and limits deployability. We explore an orthogonal axis: enlarging the retriever's corpus to reduce reliance on large LLMs. Experimental results show that corpus scaling consistently strengthens RAG and can often serve as a substitute for increasing model size, though with diminishing returns at larger scales. Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the most, while tiny and large models benefit less. Our analysis shows that improvements arise primarily from increased coverage of answer-bearing passages, while utilization efficiency remains largely unchanged. These findings establish a principled corpus-generator trade-off: investing in larger corpora offers an effective path to stronger RAG, often comparable to enlarging the LLM itself.

Abstract: Hyperparameters greatly impact models' capabilities; however, modern models are too large for extensive search. Instead, researchers design recipes that train well across scales based on their understanding of the hyperparameters. Despite this importance, few tools exist for understanding the hyperparameter loss surface. We discover novel structure in it and propose a new theory yielding such tools. The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search. Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its convergence. These new tools enable new analyses, such as confidence intervals for the best possible performance or determining the effective number of hyperparameters. We make these tools available at https://github.com/nicholaslourie/opda .

Abstract: Open-weight LLMs can be modified at inference time with simple activation edits, which raises a practical question for safety: do common safety interventions like refusal training or metatag training survive such edits? We study model abliteration, a lightweight projection technique designed to remove refusal-sensitive directions, and conduct a controlled evaluation across a granular sequence of Safety Pretraining checkpoints for SmolLM2-1.7B, alongside widely used open baselines. For each of 20 systems, original and abliterated, we issue 100 prompts with balanced harmful and harmless cases, classify responses as **Refusal** or **Non-Refusal** using multiple judges, and validate judge fidelity on a small human-labeled subset. We also probe whether models can identify refusal in their own outputs. Our study produces a checkpoint-level characterization of which data-centric safety components remain robust under abliteration, quantifies how judge selection influences evaluation outcomes, and outlines a practical protocol for integrating inference-time edits into safety assessments.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue, such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding resources could be found at: https://github.com/Deng-Jingyuan/MaskCD .

Abstract: Kleinberg and Mullainathan (2024) recently proposed an interesting model for language generation in the limit: Given a countable collection of languages, and an adversary enumerating the strings of some language $L$ from the collection, the objective is to generate new strings from the target language, such that all strings generated beyond some finite time are valid. Li, Raman and Tewari (2024) and Charikar and Pabbaraju (2024) showed strong non-uniform generation guarantees in this model, giving algorithms that generate new valid strings from $L$ after seeing a number of distinct input strings $t(L)$ that depends only on $L$ (and the collection), but not the enumeration order. However, for both these works, the language-wise generation times $t(L)$ of the algorithm can be strictly sub-optimal.
  In this work, we study Pareto-optimality of non-uniform language generation in the limit. We propose an algorithm, whose generation times $t^\star(L)$ are (almost) Pareto-optimal: any other algorithm whose generation time for some language $L$ is strictly smaller than $t^\star(L)$, must satisfy that its generation time for some other language $L'$ is strictly worse than $t^\star(L')$. Pareto-optimality is essentially the best that one can achieve for non-uniform generation. Our algorithmic framework conveniently adapts to further give Pareto-optimal non-uniform generation algorithms in the practically motivated settings of noisy as well as representative generation.

Existing methods either assess entire reasoning chains, suffering attention dilution, or rely on expensive multi-sampling. We introduce Node-wise Consistency Verification (NCV), a training-free framework that recasts verification as lightweight binary consistency checks at the node level. By decomposing the chain of thought into interconnected verification nodes, NCV precisely localizes errors and avoids unnecessary long-form generation. Experiments demonstrate that our approach enhances interpretability and efficiency, presenting a scalable solution for reliable LLM reasoning verification. On public datasets, NCV achieves a 10\% to 25\% improvement in F1 scores over baselines while utilizing $6\times$~$58\times$ fewer tokens than traditional methods like CoT-based verifiers.

<title>Beyond the Final Answer: Evaluating the Reasoning Trajectories of Tool-Augmented Agents</title>

Abstract: Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity. The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.

<title>When Names Disappear: Revealing What LLMs Actually Understand About Code</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong results on code tasks, but how they derive program meaning remains unclear. We argue that code communicates through two channels: structural semantics, which define formal behavior, and human-interpretable naming, which conveys intent. Removing the naming channel severely degrades intent-level tasks such as summarization, where models regress to line-by-line descriptions. Surprisingly, we also observe consistent reductions on execution tasks that should depend only on structure, revealing that current benchmarks reward memorization of naming patterns rather than genuine semantic reasoning. To disentangle these effects, we introduce a suite of semantics-preserving obfuscations and show that they expose identifier leakage across both summarization and execution. Building on these insights, we release ClassEval-Obf, an obfuscation-enhanced benchmark that systematically suppresses naming cues while preserving behavior. Our results demonstrate that ClassEval-Obf reduces inflated performance gaps, weakens memorization shortcuts, and provides a more reliable basis for assessing LLMs' code understanding and generalization.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential for visual planning but struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning. In contrast, Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal planning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these complementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into PDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem files satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain files, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely on human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access for refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can autonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual planning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and a GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the PDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of generalizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the different instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different problems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world domains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game rules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios, simulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal reaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of SimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for unseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively.

<title>Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion: Make Your Diffusion Language Model a Latent Reasoner</title>

Abstract: Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space, leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.

<title>Low-probability Tokens Sustain Exploration in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses, signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \textbf{\textit{reasoning sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of \textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse. This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a $60.17\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\%$ over prior methods. Code is available at https://github.com/CarlanLark/Lp-Reg.

Abstract: Neural machine translation (MT) models achieve strong results across a variety of settings, but it is widely believed that they are highly sensitive to "noisy" inputs, such as spelling errors, abbreviations, and other formatting issues. In this paper, we revisit this insight in light of recent multilingual MT models and large language models (LLMs) applied to machine translation. Somewhat surprisingly, we show through controlled experiments that these models are far more robust to many kinds of noise than previous models, even when they perform similarly on clean data. This is notable because, even though LLMs have more parameters and more complex training processes than past models, none of the open ones we consider use any techniques specifically designed to encourage robustness. Next, we show that similar trends hold for social media translation experiments -- LLMs are more robust to social media text. We include an analysis of the circumstances in which source correction techniques can be used to mitigate the effects of noise. Altogether, we show that robustness to many types of noise has increased.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used by software engineers for programming tasks. However, research shows that LLMs often lack a deep understanding of program semantics. Even minor changes to syntax, such as renaming variables, can significantly degrade performance across various tasks. In this work, we examine the task of type prediction: given a partially typed program, can a model predict a missing type annotations such that the resulting program is more typed? We construct a dataset of adversarial examples where models initially predict the correct types, but begin to fail after semantically irrelevant edits. This is problematic, as models should ideally generalize across different syntactic forms of semantically equivalent code. This lack of robustness suggests that models may have a shallow understanding of code semantics. Despite this, we provide evidence that LLMs do, in fact, learn robust mechanisms for type prediction-though these mechanisms often fail to activate in adversarial scenarios. By using activation steering, a method that manipulates a model's internal activations to guide it toward using latent knowledge, we restore accurate predictions on adversarial inputs. We show that steering successfully activates a type prediction mechanism that is shared by both Python and TypeScript, and is more effective than prompting with in-context examples. Across five different models, our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that LLMs can learn generalizable representations of code semantics that transfer across programming languages.

<title>ChunkKV: Semantic-Preserving KV Cache Compression for Efficient Long-Context LLM Inference</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant GPU memory when processing long texts, with the key value (KV) cache consuming up to 70\% of total memory during inference. Although existing compression methods reduce memory by evaluating the importance of individual tokens, they overlook critical semantic relationships between tokens, resulting in fragmented context and degraded performance. We introduce ChunkKV, which fundamentally reimagines KV cache compression by treating semantic chunks - rather than isolated tokens - as basic compression units. This approach preserves complete linguistic structures and contextual integrity, ensuring that essential meaning is retained even under aggressive compression. Our innovation includes a novel layer-wise index reuse technique that exploits the higher cross-layer similarity of preserved indices in ChunkKV, reducing computational overhead and improving throughput by 26.5\%. Comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks: LongBench, Needle-In-A-HayStack, GSM8K, and JailbreakV demonstrate that ChunkKV outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 8.7\% in precision while maintaining the same compression ratio. These results confirm that semantic-aware compression significantly enhances both efficiency and performance for long-context LLM inference, providing a simple yet effective solution to the memory bottleneck problem.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems traditionally employ sophisticated training strategies to enhance robustness against retrieval noise. In this work, we investigate a critical question: does the benefit of these complex robust training methods diminish as language models become more powerful? Through systematic evaluation across multiple model scales and question-answering datasets, our analysis reveals a consistent trend: \emph{the marginal robustness benefit of sophisticated training strategies decreases substantially as model capacity increases.} While smaller models show significant performance improvements from complex document selection and adversarial objectives, more capable models achieve comparable or even superior performance with simpler training approaches. Further investigation demonstrates that stronger models naturally exhibit better confidence calibration, cross-dataset generalization capability, and more effective attention patterns, even under simple training regimes. These findings suggest that as foundation models evolve, the engineering effort invested in complex robust training may yield diminishing returns, indicating that simplified RAG pipelines could suffice for powerful models while maintaining competitive performance.

<title>Towards Economical Inference: Enabling DeepSeek's Multi-Head Latent Attention in Any Transformer-based LLMs</title>

Abstract: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) is an innovative architecture proposed by DeepSeek, designed to ensure efficient and economical inference by significantly compressing the Key-Value (KV) cache into a latent vector. Compared to MLA, standard LLMs employing Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and its variants such as Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) exhibit significant cost disadvantages. Enabling well-trained LLMs (e.g., Llama) to rapidly adapt to MLA without pre-training from scratch is both meaningful and challenging. This paper proposes the first data-efficient fine-tuning method for transitioning from MHA to MLA (MHA2MLA), which includes two key components: for partial-RoPE, we remove RoPE from dimensions of queries and keys that contribute less to the attention scores, for low-rank approximation, we introduce joint SVD approximations based on the pre-trained parameters of keys and values. These carefully designed strategies enable MHA2MLA to recover performance using only a small fraction (0.3% to 0.6%) of the data, significantly reducing inference costs while seamlessly integrating with compression techniques such as KV cache quantization. For example, the KV cache size of Llama2-7B is reduced by 92.19%, with only a 0.5% drop in LongBench performance.

Abstract: Humor is prevalent in online communications and it often relies on more than one modality (e.g., cartoons and memes). Interpreting humor in multimodal settings requires drawing on diverse types of knowledge, including metaphorical, sociocultural, and commonsense knowledge. However, identifying the most useful knowledge remains an open question. We introduce \method{}, a method inspired by the information bottleneck principle that elicits relevant world knowledge from vision and language models which is iteratively refined for generating an explanation of the humor in an unsupervised manner. Our experiments on three datasets confirm the advantage of our method over a range of baselines. Our method can further be adapted in the future for additional tasks that can benefit from eliciting and conditioning on relevant world knowledge and open new research avenues in this direction.

Abstract: Reasoning language models have shown an uncanny ability to improve performance at test-time by ``thinking longer''-that is, by generating longer chain-of-thought sequences and hence using more compute. However, the length of their chain-of-thought reasoning is not controllable, making it impossible to allocate test-time compute to achieve a desired level of performance. We introduce Length Controlled Policy Optimization (LCPO), a simple reinforcement learning method that optimizes for accuracy and adherence to user-specified length constraints. We use LCPO to train L1, a reasoning language model that produces outputs satisfying a length constraint given in its prompt. L1's length control allows for smoothly trading off computational cost and accuracy on a wide range of tasks, and outperforms the state-of-the-art S1 method for length control. Furthermore, we uncover an unexpected short chain-of-thought capability in models trained with LCPO. Specifically, using LCPO we derive Short Reasoning Models (SRMs), that exhibit similar reasoning patterns as full-length reasoning models, but can generate CoT lengths comparable to non-reasoning models. They demonstrate significant performance gains, for instance, our 1.5B L1 model surpasses GPT-4o at equal reasoning lengths. Overall, LCPO enables precise control over reasoning length, allowing for fine-grained allocation of test-time compute and accuracy. We release code and models at https://www.cmu-l3.github.io/l1

Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM) agents for automating data science show promise, but they remain constrained by narrow task scopes, limited generalization across tasks and models, and over-reliance on state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. We introduce DatawiseAgent, a notebook-centric LLM agent framework for adaptive and robust data science automation. Inspired by how human data scientists work in computational notebooks, DatawiseAgent introduces a unified interaction representation and a multi-stage architecture based on finite-state transducers (FSTs). This design enables flexible long-horizon planning, progressive solution development, and robust recovery from execution failures. Extensive experiments across diverse data science scenarios and models show that DatawiseAgent consistently achieves SOTA performance by surpassing strong baselines such as AutoGen and TaskWeaver, demonstrating superior effectiveness and adaptability. Further evaluations reveal graceful performance degradation under weaker or smaller models, underscoring the robustness and scalability.

Abstract: We introduce Spire, a speech-augmented language model (LM) capable of both translating and transcribing speech input from English into 10 other languages as well as translating text input in both language directions. Spire integrates the speech modality into an existing multilingual LM via speech discretization and continued pre-training using only 42.5K hours of speech. In particular, we adopt the pretraining framework of multilingual LMs and treat discretized speech input as an additional translation language. This approach not only equips the model with speech capabilities, but also preserves its strong text-based performance. We achieve this using significantly less data than existing speech LMs, demonstrating that discretized speech input integration as an additional language is feasible during LM adaptation. We make our code and models available to the community.

Abstract: When asked to explain their decisions, LLMs can often give explanations which sound plausible to humans. But are these explanations faithful, i.e. do they convey the factors actually responsible for the decision? In this work, we analyse counterfactual faithfulness across 75 models from 13 families. We analyze the tradeoff between conciseness and comprehensiveness, how correlational faithfulness metrics assess this tradeoff, and the extent to which metrics can be gamed. This analysis motivates two new metrics: the phi-CCT, a simplified variant of the Correlational Counterfactual Test (CCT) which avoids the need for token probabilities while explaining most of the variance of the original test; and F-AUROC, which eliminates sensitivity to imbalanced intervention distributions and captures a model's ability to produce explanations with different levels of detail. Our findings reveal a clear scaling trend: larger and more capable models are consistently more faithful on all metrics we consider.

Abstract: We study last-layer outlier dimensions, i.e. dimensions that display extreme activations for the majority of inputs. We show that outlier dimensions arise in many different modern language models, and trace their function back to the heuristic of constantly predicting frequent words. We further show how a model can block this heuristic when it is not contextually appropriate, by assigning a counterbalancing weight mass to the remaining dimensions, and we investigate which model parameters boost outlier dimensions and when they arise during training. We conclude that outlier dimensions are a specialized mechanism discovered by many distinct models to implement a useful token prediction heuristic.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has become the standard approach for equipping Large Language Models (LLMs) with up-to-date knowledge. However, standard RAG, relying on independent passage retrieval, often fails to capture the interconnected nature of information required for complex, multi-hop reasoning. While structured RAG methods attempt to address this using knowledge graphs built from triples, we argue that the inherent context loss of triples (context collapse) limits the fidelity of the knowledge representation. We introduce PropRAG, a novel RAG framework that shifts from triples to context-rich propositions and introduces an efficient, LLM-free online beam search over proposition paths to discover multi-step reasoning chains. By coupling a higher-fidelity knowledge representation with explicit path discovery, PropRAG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot Recall@5 and F1 scores on 2Wiki, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue, advancing non-parametric knowledge integration by improving evidence retrieval through richer representation and efficient reasoning path discovery.

Abstract: Accurately evaluating machine-translated text remains a long-standing challenge, particularly for long documents. Recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can serve as reliable and interpretable sentence-level translation evaluators via MQM error span annotations. With modern LLMs supporting larger context windows, a natural question arises: can we feed entire document translations into an LLM for quality assessment? Ideally, evaluation should be invariant to text length, producing consistent error spans regardless of input granularity. However, our analysis shows that text length significantly impacts evaluation: longer texts lead to fewer error spans and reduced system ranking accuracy. To address this limitation, we evaluate several strategies, including granularity-aligned prompting, Focus Sentence Prompting (FSP), and a fine-tuning approach to better align LLMs with the evaluation task. The latter two methods largely mitigate this length bias, making LLMs more reliable for long-form translation evaluation.

Abstract: Neural language models are black-boxes--both linguistic patterns and factual knowledge are distributed across billions of opaque parameters. This entangled encoding makes it difficult to reliably inspect, verify, or update specific facts. We introduce Limited Memory Language Models (LMLM), a new class of language models that externalizes factual knowledge to external database during pre-training rather than memorizing them. Our pre-training approach strategically masks externally retrieved factual values from the training loss, thereby teaching the model to perform targeted lookups rather than relying on memorization in model weights. Our experiments demonstrate that LMLMs achieve competitive performance compared to significantly larger LLMs on standard benchmarks, while offering the advantages of explicit, editable, and verifiable knowledge bases.

Abstract: Obtaining large-scale, high-quality reasoning data is crucial for improving the geometric reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing data generation methods, whether based on predefined tem plates or constrained symbolic provers, inevitably face diversity and numerical generalization limitations. To address these limitations, we propose NeSyGeo, a novel neuro-symbolic framework for generating geometric reasoning data. First, we propose a domain-specific language grounded in the entity-attributes-relations paradigm to comprehensively represent all components of plane geometry, along with generative actions defined within this symbolic space. We then design a symbolic-visual-text pipeline that synthesizes symbolic sequences, maps them to visual and textual representations and generates reasoning path with reverse search and forward validation. Based on this framework, we construct NeSyGeo CoT and NeSyGeo-Caption datasets, containing 100k samples, and release a new benchmark NeSyGeo-Test for evaluating geometric reasoning abilities in MLLMs. Experiments demonstrate that the proposal significantly and consistently improves the performance of multiple MLLMs under both reinforcement and supervised fine-tuning. With only 4k samples and two epochs of reinforcement fine-tuning, base models achieve improvements of up to +15.8% on MathVision, +8.4% on MathVerse, and +7.3% on GeoQA. Notably, a 4B model can be improved to outperform an 8B model from the same series on geometric reasoning tasks.s

Abstract: We introduce EconWebArena, a benchmark for evaluating autonomous agents on complex, multimodal economic tasks in realistic web environments. The benchmark comprises 360 curated tasks from 82 authoritative websites spanning domains such as macroeconomics, labor, finance, trade, and public policy. Each task challenges agents to navigate live websites, interpret structured and visual content, interact with real interfaces, and extract precise, time-sensitive data through multi-step workflows. We construct the benchmark by prompting multiple large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate tasks, followed by rigorous human curation to ensure clarity, feasibility, and source reliability. Unlike prior work, EconWebArena emphasizes fidelity to authoritative data sources and the need for grounded web-based economic reasoning. We evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs as web agents, analyze failure cases, and conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of visual grounding, plan-based reasoning, and interaction design. Our results reveal substantial performance gaps and highlight persistent challenges in grounding, navigation, and multimodal understanding, positioning EconWebArena as a rigorous testbed for economic web intelligence.

<title>Same Task, Different Circuits: Disentangling Modality-Specific Mechanisms in VLMs</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language models (VLMs) show impressive abilities to answer questions on visual inputs (e.g., counting objects in an image), yet demonstrate higher accuracies when performing an analogous task on text (e.g., counting words in a text). We investigate this accuracy gap by identifying and comparing the \textit{circuits} - the task-specific computational sub-graphs - in different modalities. We show that while circuits are largely disjoint between modalities, they implement relatively similar functionalities: the differences lie primarily in processing modality-specific data positions (an image or a text sequence). Zooming in on the image data representations, we observe they become aligned with the higher-performing analogous textual representations only towards later layers, too late in processing to effectively influence subsequent positions. To overcome this, we patch the representations of visual data tokens from later layers back into earlier layers. In experiments with multiple tasks and models, this simple intervention closes a third of the performance gap between the modalities, on average. Our analysis sheds light on the multi-modal performance gap in VLMs and suggests a training-free approach for reducing it.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate plausible free text self-explanations to justify their answers. However, these natural language explanations may not accurately reflect the model's actual reasoning process, indicating a lack of faithfulness. Existing faithfulness evaluation methods rely primarily on behavioral tests or computational block analysis without examining the semantic content of internal neural representations. This paper proposes NeuroFaith, a flexible framework that measures the faithfulness of LLM free text self-explanation by identifying key concepts within explanations and mechanistically testing whether these concepts actually influence the model's predictions. We show the versatility of NeuroFaith across 2-hop reasoning and classification tasks. Additionally, a linear faithfulness probe based on NeuroFaith is developed to detect unfaithful self-explanations from representation space and improve faithfulness through steering. NeuroFaith provides a principled approach to evaluating and enhancing the faithfulness of LLM free text self-explanations, addressing critical needs for trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: It is important for Large Language Models (LLMs) to be aware of the boundary of their knowledge, distinguishing queries they can confidently answer from those that lie beyond their capabilities. Such awareness enables models to perform adaptive inference, such as invoking retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), engaging in slow and deep thinking, or abstaining from answering when appropriate. These mechanisms are key to developing efficient and trustworthy AI. In this work, we propose a method to detect knowledge boundaries via Query-Level Uncertainty, which estimates if a model is capable of answering a given query before generating any tokens, thus avoiding the generation cost. To this end, we propose a novel, training-free method called Internal Confidence, which leverages self-evaluations across layers and tokens to provide a reliable signal of uncertainty. Empirical studies on both factual question answering and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that our Internal Confidence outperforms several baselines in quality of confidence while being computationally cheaper. Furthermore, we demonstrate its benefits in adaptive inference settings, showing that for RAG and model cascading it reduces inference costs while preserving overall performance.

<title>When Large Language Models are Reliable for Judging Empathic Communication</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating empathic responses in text-based conversations. But, how reliably do they judge the nuances of empathic communication? We investigate this question by comparing how experts, crowdworkers, and LLMs annotate empathic communication across four evaluative frameworks drawn from psychology, natural language processing, and communications applied to 200 real-world conversations where one speaker shares a personal problem and the other offers support. Drawing on 3,150 expert annotations, 2,844 crowd annotations, and 3,150 LLM annotations, we assess inter-rater reliability between these three annotator groups. We find that expert agreement is high but varies across the frameworks' sub-components depending on their clarity, complexity, and subjectivity. We show that expert agreement offers a more informative benchmark for contextualizing LLM performance than standard classification metrics. Across all four frameworks, LLMs consistently approach this expert level benchmark and exceed the reliability of crowdworkers. These results demonstrate how LLMs, when validated on specific tasks with appropriate benchmarks, can support transparency and oversight in emotionally sensitive applications including their use as conversational companions.

Abstract: Pun generation seeks to creatively modify linguistic elements in text to produce humour or evoke double meanings. It also aims to preserve coherence and contextual appropriateness, making it useful in creative writing and entertainment across various media and contexts. Although pun generation has received considerable attention in computational linguistics, there is currently no dedicated survey that systematically reviews this specific area. To bridge this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of pun generation datasets and methods across different stages, including conventional approaches, deep learning techniques, and pre-trained language models. Additionally, we summarise both automated and human evaluation metrics used to assess the quality of pun generation. Finally, we discuss the research challenges and propose promising directions for future work.

Abstract: Turn-taking is a fundamental component of spoken dialogue, however conventional studies mostly involve dyadic settings. This work focuses on applying voice activity projection (VAP) to predict upcoming turn-taking in triadic multi-party scenarios. The goal of VAP models is to predict the future voice activity for each speaker utilizing only acoustic data. This is the first study to extend VAP into triadic conversation. We trained multiple models on a Japanese triadic dataset where participants discussed a variety of topics. We found that the VAP trained on triadic conversation outperformed the baseline for all models but that the type of conversation affected the accuracy. This study establishes that VAP can be used for turn-taking in triadic dialogue scenarios. Future work will incorporate this triadic VAP turn-taking model into spoken dialogue systems.

Abstract: Persona prompting is increasingly used in large language models (LLMs) to simulate views of various sociodemographic groups. However, how a persona prompt is formulated can significantly affect outcomes, raising concerns about the fidelity of such simulations. Using five open-source LLMs, we systematically examine how different persona prompt strategies, specifically role adoption formats and demographic priming strategies, influence LLM simulations across 15 intersectional demographic groups in both open- and closed-ended tasks. Our findings show that LLMs struggle to simulate marginalized groups but that the choice of demographic priming and role adoption strategy significantly impacts their portrayal. Specifically, we find that prompting in an interview-style format and name-based priming can help reduce stereotyping and improve alignment. Surprisingly, smaller models like OLMo-2-7B outperform larger ones such as Llama-3.3-70B. Our findings offer actionable guidance for designing sociodemographic persona prompts in LLM-based simulation studies.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), low-resource languages remain excluded from NLP, limiting digital access for millions. We present PunGPT2, the first fully open-source Punjabi generative model suite, trained on a 35GB corpus covering literature, religious texts, news, social discourse, etc. PunGPT2 captures Punjabi's syntactic and morphological richness through a tokenizer optimized for Gurmukhi and Shahmukhi scripts. We introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework integrating PunGPT2 with a FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base, and Pun-Instruct, an instruction-tuned variant using QLoRA for robust zero-shot summarization, translation, and question answering. Our key innovation, Quantum-RAG, fuses sparse, dense, and quantum kernel embeddings for efficient, context-aware retrieval with low memory overhead, marking the first practical quantum-inspired retrieval in a low-resource LLM. Our models outperform multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL, BLOOM) on FLORES-200, IndicGenBench, and a new PunjabiEval suite. Quantum-RAG yields +7.4 Recall@10 over FAISS and +3.5 BLEU over mT5 on PunjabiEval. We publicly release all training scripts, hyperparameters, evaluation pipelines, the 35GB Punjabi corpus, the PunjabiEval benchmark, and all model weights, establishing new state-of-the-art results for Punjabi language generation and retrieval.

<title>Better by Comparison: Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Reasoning for Automatic Prompt Optimization</title>

Abstract: Automatic prompt optimization has recently emerged as a strategy for improving the quality of prompts used in Large Language Models (LLMs), with the goal of generating more accurate and useful responses. However, most prior work focuses on direct prompt refinement or model fine-tuning, overlooking the potential of leveraging LLMs' inherent reasoning capability to learn from contrasting examples. In this paper, we present Contrastive Reasoning Prompt Optimization (CRPO), a novel framework that formulates prompt optimization as a retrieval-augmented reasoning process. Our approach retrieves top k reference prompt-response pairs from the HelpSteer2 dataset, an open source collection where each response is annotated for helpfulness, correctness, coherence, complexity, and verbosity, and constructs two complementary optimization paradigms: (1) tiered contrastive reasoning, where the LLM compares high-, medium-, and low-quality exemplars (both prompts and responses) to refine its own generation through reflective reasoning, and (2) multi-metric contrastive reasoning, where the LLM analyzes the best exemplars along each evaluation dimension and integrates their strengths into an optimized prompt. By explicitly contrasting high and low quality exemplars, CRPO enables the model to deduce why certain prompts succeed while others fail, thereby achieving more robust and interpretable optimization. Experimental results on the HelpSteer2 benchmark demonstrate that CRPO significantly outperforms baselines. Our findings highlight the promise of contrastive, retrieval-augmented reasoning for advancing automatic prompt optimization.

Abstract: Temporal reasoning and knowledge are essential capabilities for language models (LMs). While much prior work has analyzed and improved temporal reasoning in LMs, most studies have focused solely on the Gregorian calendar. However, many non-Gregorian systems, such as the Japanese, Hijri, and Hebrew calendars, are in active use and reflect culturally grounded conceptions of time. If and how well current LMs can accurately handle such non-Gregorian calendars has not been evaluated so far. Here, we present a systematic evaluation of how well open-source LMs handle one such non-Gregorian system: the Japanese calendar. For our evaluation, we create datasets for four tasks that require both temporal knowledge and temporal reasoning. Evaluating a range of English-centric and Japanese-centric LMs, we find that some models can perform calendar conversions, but even Japanese-centric models struggle with Japanese-calendar arithmetic and with maintaining consistency across calendars. Our results highlight the importance of developing LMs that are better equipped for culture-specific calendar understanding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise in addressing complex medical problems. However, while most prior studies focus on improving accuracy and reasoning abilities, a significant bottleneck in developing effective healthcare agents lies in the readability of LLM-generated responses, specifically, their ability to answer public health problems clearly and simply to people without medical backgrounds. In this work, we introduce RephQA, a benchmark for evaluating the readability of LLMs in public health question answering (QA). It contains 533 expert-reviewed QA pairs from 27 sources across 13 topics, and includes a proxy multiple-choice task to assess informativeness, along with two readability metrics: Flesch-Kincaid grade level and professional score. Evaluation of 25 LLMs reveals that most fail to meet readability standards, highlighting a gap between reasoning and effective communication. To address this, we explore four readability-enhancing strategies-standard prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and a token-adapted variant. Token-adapted GRPO achieves the best results, advancing the development of more practical and user-friendly public health agents. These results represent a step toward building more practical agents for public health.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning improves LLM reasoning, yet sparse delayed reward over long sequences makes token-level credit assignment the key bottleneck. We study the verifiable-reward setting, where the final answer is checkable and multiple responses can be drawn per prompt. Reasoning tasks in math and medical QA align with this setup, where only a few decision tokens significantly impact the outcome. PPO offers token-level advantages with a learned value model, but it is complex to train both the actor and critic models simultaneously, and it is not easily generalizable, as the token-level values from the critic model can make training prone to overfitting. GRPO is critic-free and supports verifiable rewards, but spreads a single sequence-level return across tokens and ignores branching. We introduce \textbf{Prefix-to-Tree (P2T)}, a simple procedure that converts a group of responses into a prefix tree and computes \emph{nonparametric} prefix values \(V(s)\) by aggregating descendant outcomes. Built on P2T, we propose \textbf{TEMPO} (\emph{\textbf{T}ree-\textbf{E}stimated \textbf{M}ean Prefix Value for \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization}), a critic-free algorithm that augments the group-relative outcome signal of GRPO with \emph{branch-gated} temporal-difference corrections derived from the tree. At non-branch tokens, the temporal-difference (TD) term is zero, so TEMPO reduces to GRPO; at branching tokens, it supplies precise token-level credit without a learned value network or extra judges/teachers. On Qwen3-1.7B/4B, TEMPO outperforms PPO and GRPO on in-distribution (MATH, MedQA) and out-of-distribution (GSM-HARD, AMC23, MedMCQA, MMLU-Medical) benchmarks, and reaches higher validation accuracy with roughly the same wall-clock time.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across natural language processing (NLP) tasks. As real-world applications increasingly demand longer context windows, continued pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context data has become a common approach. While the effects of data length in continued pretraining have been extensively studied, their implications for SFT remain unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate how SFT data length influences LLM behavior on short-context tasks. Counterintuitively, we find that long-context SFT improves short-context performance, contrary to the commonly observed degradation from long-context pretraining. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon, we first decouple and analyze two key components, Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN), and show that both independently benefit from long-context SFT. We further study their interaction and reveal a knowledge preference bias: long-context SFT promotes contextual knowledge, while short-context SFT favors parametric knowledge, making exclusive reliance on long-context SFT suboptimal. Finally, we demonstrate that hybrid training mitigates this bias, offering explainable guidance for fine-tuning LLMs.

Abstract: Recent video generative models primarily rely on carefully written text prompts for specific tasks, like inpainting or style editing. They require labor-intensive textual descriptions for input videos, hindering their flexibility to adapt personal/raw videos to user specifications. This paper proposes RACCooN, a versatile and user-friendly video-to-paragraph-to-video generative framework that supports multiple video editing capabilities such as removal, addition, and modification, through a unified pipeline. RACCooN consists of two principal stages: Video-to-Paragraph (V2P) and Paragraph-to-Video (P2V). In the V2P stage, we automatically describe video scenes in well-structured natural language, capturing both the holistic context and focused object details. Subsequently, in the P2V stage, users can optionally refine these descriptions to guide the video diffusion model, enabling various modifications to the input video, such as removing, changing subjects, and/or adding new objects. The proposed approach stands out from other methods through several significant contributions: (1) RACCooN suggests a multi-granular spatiotemporal pooling strategy to generate well-structured video descriptions, capturing both the broad context and object details without requiring complex human annotations, simplifying precise video content editing based on text for users. (2) Our video generative model incorporates auto-generated narratives or instructions to enhance the quality and accuracy of the generated content. (3) RACCooN also plans to imagine new objects in a given video, so users simply prompt the model to receive a detailed video editing plan for complex video editing. The proposed framework demonstrates impressive versatile capabilities in video-to-paragraph generation, video content editing, and can be incorporated into other SoTA video generative models for further enhancement.

arXiv:2412.07192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a new vulnerability in commercial-scale safety-aligned large language models (LLMs): their refusal to generate harmful responses can be broken by flipping only a few bits in model parameters. Our attack jailbreaks billion-parameter language models with just 5 to 25 bit-flips, requiring up to 40$\times$ fewer bit flips than prior attacks on much smaller computer vision models. Unlike prompt-based jailbreaks, our method directly uncensors models in memory at runtime, enabling harmful outputs without requiring input-level modifications. Our key innovation is an efficient bit-selection algorithm that identifies critical bits for language model jailbreaks up to 20$\times$ faster than prior methods.
  We evaluate our attack on 10 open-source LLMs, achieving high attack success rates (ASRs) of 80-98% with minimal impact on model utility. We further demonstrate an end-to-end exploit via Rowhammer-based fault injection, reliably jailbreaking 5 models (69-91% ASR) on a GDDR6 GPU. Our analyses reveal that: (1) models with weaker post-training alignment require fewer bit-flips to jailbreak; (2) certain model components, e.g., value projection layers, are substantially more vulnerable; and (3) the attack is mechanistically different from existing jailbreak methods. We evaluate potential countermeasures and find that our attack remains effective against defenses at various stages of the LLM pipeline.

Abstract: The main challenges limiting the adoption of deep learning-based solutions in medical workflows are the availability of annotated data and the lack of interpretability of such systems. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) tackle the latter by constraining the model output on a set of predefined and human-interpretable concepts. However, the increased interpretability achieved through these concept-based explanations implies a higher annotation burden. Moreover, if a new concept needs to be added, the whole system needs to be retrained. Inspired by the remarkable performance shown by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in few-shot settings, we propose a simple, yet effective, methodology, CBVLM, which tackles both of the aforementioned challenges. First, for each concept, we prompt the LVLM to answer if the concept is present in the input image. Then, we ask the LVLM to classify the image based on the previous concept predictions. Moreover, in both stages, we incorporate a retrieval module responsible for selecting the best examples for in-context learning. By grounding the final diagnosis on the predicted concepts, we ensure explainability, and by leveraging the few-shot capabilities of LVLMs, we drastically lower the annotation cost. We validate our approach with extensive experiments across four medical datasets and twelve LVLMs (both generic and medical) and show that CBVLM consistently outperforms CBMs and task-specific supervised methods without requiring any training and using just a few annotated examples.

Abstract: MarketSenseAI is a novel framework for holistic stock analysis which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to process financial news, historical prices, company fundamentals and the macroeconomic environment to support decision making in stock analysis and selection. In this paper, we present the latest advancements on MarketSenseAI, driven by rapid technological expansion in LLMs. Through a novel architecture combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation and LLM agents, the framework processes SEC filings and earnings calls, while enriching macroeconomic analysis through systematic processing of diverse institutional reports. We demonstrate a significant improvement in fundamental analysis accuracy over the previous version. Empirical evaluation on S\&amp;P 100 stocks over two years (2023-2024) shows MarketSenseAI achieving cumulative returns of 125.9% compared to the index return of 73.5%, while maintaining comparable risk profiles. Further validation on S\&amp;P 500 stocks during 2024 demonstrates the framework's scalability, delivering a 33.8% higher Sortino ratio than the market. This work marks a significant advancement in applying LLM technology to financial analysis, offering insights into the robustness of LLM-driven investment strategies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in specialized fields such as finance, law, and medicine. However, in cybersecurity, we have noticed a lack of open-source datasets, with a particular lack of high-quality cybersecurity pretraining corpora, even though much research indicates that LLMs acquire their knowledge during pretraining. To address this, we present a comprehensive suite of datasets covering all major training stages, including pretraining, instruction fine-tuning, and reasoning distillation with cybersecurity-specific self-reflection data. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate their effectiveness on public cybersecurity benchmarks. In particular, continual pre-training on our dataset yields a 15.9% improvement in the aggregate score, while reasoning distillation leads to a 15.8% gain in security certification (CISSP). We will release all datasets and trained cybersecurity LLMs under the ODC-BY and MIT licenses to encourage further research in the community.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate or automate human behavior in complex sequential decision-making settings. A natural question is then whether LLMs exhibit similar decision-making behavior to humans, and can achieve comparable (or superior) performance. In this work, we focus on the exploration-exploitation (E&amp;E) tradeoff, a fundamental aspect of dynamic decision-making under uncertainty. We employ canonical multi-armed bandit (MAB) experiments introduced in the cognitive science and psychiatry literature to conduct a comparative study of the E&amp;E strategies of LLMs, humans, and MAB algorithms. We use interpretable choice models to capture the E&amp;E strategies of the agents and investigate how enabling thinking traces, through both prompting strategies and thinking models, shapes LLM decision-making. We find that enabling thinking in LLMs shifts their behavior toward more human-like behavior, characterized by a mix of random and directed exploration. In a simple stationary setting, thinking-enabled LLMs exhibit similar levels of random and directed exploration compared to humans. However, in more complex, non-stationary environments, LLMs struggle to match human adaptability, particularly in effective directed exploration, despite achieving similar regret in certain scenarios. Our findings highlight both the promise and limits of LLMs as simulators of human behavior and tools for automated decision-making and point to potential areas for improvement.

<title>SelfBudgeter: Adaptive Token Allocation for Efficient LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: While reasoning models demonstrate exceptional performance on complex tasks, they often exhibit tendencies of overthinking on simple problems. This phenomenon not only leads to excessive computational resource consumption but also significantly degrades user experience. To address this challenge, we propose SelfBudgeter - a novel user-friendly adaptive controllable reasoning framework that incorporates a budget estimation mechanism prior to reasoning. The framework adopts a dual-phase training paradigm: during the cold-start phase, the model learns to predict token budgets before executing reasoning in a standardized format; in the reinforcement learning phase, the model is trained to autonomously plan budgets based on problem difficulty and strictly adhere to them when generating responses. Since the model outputs budget estimates at the initial stage, users can immediately anticipate waiting duration, enabling flexible decisions on whether to interrupt or continue the generation process. Notably, our method supports manual control of reasoning length through pre-filled budget fields. Experimental results demonstrate that SelfBudgeter can dynamically allocate budgets according to problem complexity, yielding an average response length compression of 61% for the 1.5B model on GSM8K, MATH500, and AIME2025, and 48% for the 7B model, while maintaining nearly undiminished accuracy.

<title>Understanding the Performance Gap in Preference Learning: A Dichotomy of RLHF and DPO</title>

Abstract: We present a fine-grained theoretical analysis of the performance gap between reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) under a representation gap. Our study decomposes this gap into two sources: an explicit representation gap under exact optimization and an implicit representation gap under finite samples. In the exact optimization setting, we characterize how the relative capacities of the reward and policy model classes influence the final policy qualities. We show that RLHF, DPO, or online DPO can outperform one another depending on type of model mis-specifications. Notably, online DPO can outperform both RLHF and standard DPO when the reward and policy model classes are isomorphic and both mis-specified. In the approximate optimization setting, we provide a concrete construction where the ground-truth reward is implicitly sparse and show that RLHF requires significantly fewer samples than DPO to recover an effective reward model -- highlighting a statistical advantage of two-stage learning. Together, these results provide a comprehensive understanding of the performance gap between RLHF and DPO under various settings, and offer practical insights into when each method is preferred.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become essential for large-scale code generation, grounding predictions in external code corpora to improve actuality. However, a critical yet underexplored aspect of RAG pipelines is chunking -- the process of dividing documents into retrievable units. Existing line-based chunking heuristics often break semantic structures, splitting functions or merging unrelated code, which can degrade generation quality. We propose chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (\ourwork), a structure-aware method that recursively breaks large AST nodes into smaller chunks and merges sibling nodes while respecting size limits. This approach generates self-contained, semantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving performance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3 points on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation. Our work highlights the importance of structure-aware chunking for scaling retrieval-enhanced code intelligence.

<title>From Long Videos to Engaging Clips: A Human-Inspired Video Editing Framework with Multimodal Narrative Understanding</title>

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks: highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500 professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

<title>Rubrics as Rewards: Reinforcement Learning Beyond Verifiable Domains</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for complex reasoning tasks with clear correctness signals such as math and coding. However, extending it to real-world reasoning tasks is challenging, as evaluation depends on nuanced, multi-criteria judgments rather than binary correctness. Instance-specific rubrics have recently been used in evaluation benchmarks to capture such judgments, but their potential as reward signals for on-policy post-training remains underexplored. We introduce $\textbf{Rubrics as Rewards}$ (RaR), an on-policy reinforcement learning method that extends RLVR beyond verifiable domains by using rubric-based feedback. Across both medical and science domains, we evaluate multiple strategies for aggregating rubric feedback into rewards. The best RaR variant achieves relative improvements of up to $31\%$ on HealthBench and $7\%$ on GPQA-Diamond over popular LLM-as-judge baselines that rely on direct Likert-based rewards. These results demonstrate that RaR-trained policies adapt well to diverse evaluation formats, performing strongly on both rubric-based and multiple-choice tasks. Moreover, we find that using rubrics as structured reward signals yields better alignment for smaller judges and reduces performance variance across judge scales.

<title>FinAgentBench: A Benchmark Dataset for Agentic Retrieval in Financial Question Answering</title>

arXiv:2508.14052v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate information retrieval (IR) is critical in the financial domain, where investors must identify relevant information from large collections of documents. Traditional IR methods -- whether sparse or dense -- often fall short in retrieval accuracy, as it requires not only capturing semantic similarity but also performing fine-grained reasoning over document structure and domain-specific knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened up new opportunities for retrieval with multi-step reasoning, where the model ranks passages through iterative reasoning about which information is most relevant to a given query. However, there exists no benchmark to evaluate such capabilities in the financial domain. To address this gap, we introduce FinAgentBench, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating retrieval with multi-step reasoning in finance -- a setting we term agentic retrieval. The benchmark consists of 26K expert-annotated examples on S&amp;P-500 listed firms and assesses whether LLM agents can (1) identify the most relevant document type among candidates, and (2) pinpoint the key passage within the selected document. Our evaluation framework explicitly separates these two reasoning steps to address context limitations. This design enables to provide a quantitative basis for understanding retrieval-centric LLM behavior in finance. We evaluate a suite of state-of-the-art models and further demonstrated how targeted fine-tuning can significantly improve agentic retrieval performance. Our benchmark provides a foundation for studying retrieval-centric LLM behavior in complex, domain-specific tasks for finance.

Abstract: When using a public communication channel -- whether formal or informal, such as commenting or posting on social media -- end users have no expectation of privacy: they compose a message and broadcast it for the world to see. Even if an end user takes utmost precautions to anonymize their online presence -- using an alias or pseudonym; masking their IP address; spoofing their geolocation; concealing their operating system and user agent; deploying encryption; registering with a disposable phone number or email; disabling non-essential settings; revoking permissions; and blocking cookies and fingerprinting -- one obvious element still lingers: the message itself. Assuming they avoid lapses in judgment or accidental self-exposure, there should be little evidence to validate their actual identity, right? Wrong. The content of their message -- necessarily open for public consumption -- exposes an attack vector: stylometric analysis, or author profiling. In this paper, we dissect the technique of stylometry, discuss an antithetical counter-strategy in adversarial stylometry, and devise enhancements through Unicode steganography.

arXiv:2509.13761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in mathematical reasoning, but still continue to struggle with high-precision tasks like numerical computation and formal symbolic manipulation. Integrating external tools has emerged as a promising approach to bridge this gap. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: constructing tool-integrated reasoning data, performing fine-grained optimization, and enhancing inference. To overcome these limitations, we propose THOR (Tool-Integrated Hierarchical Optimization via RL). First, we introduce TIRGen, a multi-agent actor-critic-based pipeline for constructing high-quality datasets of tool-integrated reasoning paths, aligning with the policy and generalizing well across diverse models. Second, to perform fine-grained hierarchical optimization, we introduce an RL strategy that jointly optimizes for both episode-level problem solving and step-level code generation. This is motivated by our key insight that the success of an intermediate tool call is a strong predictor of the final answer's correctness. Finally, THOR incorporates a self-correction mechanism that leverages immediate tool feedback to dynamically revise erroneous reasoning paths during inference. Our approach demonstrates strong generalization across diverse models, performing effectively in both reasoning and non-reasoning models. It further achieves state-of-the-art performance for models of a similar scale on multiple mathematical benchmarks, while also delivering consistent improvements on code benchmarks. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/JingMog/THOR.

arXiv:2509.22315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking, Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and \textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation}, \textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and \textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

<div> vulnerable, structural perturbations, semantic perturbations, pseudocode, syntactic styles
Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) benefit from code data to improve reasoning abilities. A systematic study using different programming languages and controlled perturbations revealed that LLMs are more affected by structural than semantic disruptions, especially in math and code tasks. Abstract representations like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, and compressing information with fewer tokens can maintain or enhance performance. Even corrupted code can perform well if surface-level regularities are preserved. Different syntactic styles impact task-specific performance, with Python excelling in natural language reasoning and lower-level languages like Java and Rust in math tasks. This research provides insights into how code properties influence LLM reasoning and offers guidance for enhancing their capabilities through training data design.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.21499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Code data has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear which aspects of code are most responsible. We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist. Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

The article introduces a new dataset of concept learning tasks aimed at uncovering implicit biases in large language models. Through in-context concept learning experiments, the study reveals a potential bias towards upward monotonicity in quantifiers within language models. Interestingly, this bias is less pronounced when the models are tested using direct prompting devoid of concept learning components. The findings underscore the importance of utilizing in-context concept learning as an effective means of identifying hidden biases in language models. <div>

Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) for low-resource languages remains fundamentally constrained by the lack of textual corpora, standardized orthographies, and scalable annotation pipelines. While recent advances in large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive, pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery, where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology, particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity. This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.

Summary:<br /><br />
This paper introduces a framework using large language models to assess the maturity of climate disclosures among US-listed firms, revealing insights into the state of corporate sustainability reporting. Risk-focused narratives are often linked to explicit commitments, but quantitative targets like net-zero pledges lack alignment in tone. Larger and higher-emitting firms tend to disclose more commitments and actions but struggle with consistent quantitative targets. The analysis also uncovers a trend of mimetic behavior in disclosure styles, diminishing differentiation and decision usefulness. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and emphasize the necessity for stronger regulation to ensure commitments are backed by verifiable transition strategies. <div>
arXiv:2510.01222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change has increased demands for transparent and comparable corporate climate disclosures, yet imitation and symbolic reporting often undermine their value. This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment, specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights: (1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2) larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect commitments with verifiable transition strategies.

The study evaluated three veterinary-focused large language models (LLMs) summarization tools on veterinary oncology records. Product 1 achieved the highest overall performance, scoring well in domains such as Factual Accuracy and Chronological Order. The evaluation process using the LLM-as-a-judge framework showed high reproducibility across multiple runs. These findings emphasize the need for veterinary-specific LLM tools and demonstrate the effectiveness of using LLMs as judges in assessing clinical natural language processing (NLP) summarization in veterinary medicine. The study showcases the potential of LLMs in clinical settings and highlights the importance of accurate, complete, and clinically relevant summarization in veterinary oncology. Discovering the optimal use of LLMs in veterinary medicine could greatly benefit the field by improving efficiency and accuracy in handling clinical records.

arXiv:2510.01224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, yet their performance in veterinary medicine remains underexplored. We evaluated three commercially available veterinary-focused LLM summarization tools (Product 1 [Hachiko] and Products 2 and 3) on a standardized dataset of veterinary oncology records. Using a rubric-guided LLM-as-a-judge framework, summaries were scored across five domains: Factual Accuracy, Completeness, Chronological Order, Clinical Relevance, and Organization. Product 1 achieved the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR: 0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for Product 3. It also received perfect median scores in Factual Accuracy and Chronological Order. To assess the internal consistency of the grading framework itself, we repeated the evaluation across three independent runs. The LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3). These findings highlight the importance of veterinary-specific commercial LLM tools and demonstrate that LLM-as-a-judge evaluation is a scalable and reproducible method for assessing clinical NLP summarization in veterinary medicine.

Abstract: We introduce ClaimCheck, an LLM-guided automatic fact-checking system designed to verify real-world claims using live Web evidence and small language models. Unlike prior systems that rely on large, closed-source models and static knowledge stores, ClaimCheck employs a transparent, stepwise verification pipeline that mirrors human fact-checking workflows consisting of Web search query planning, Web-based evidence retrieval and summarization, evidence synthesis and re-retrieval, and claim verdict evaluation. Each module is optimized for small LLMs, allowing the system to deliver accurate and interpretable fact-checking with significantly lower computational requirements. Despite using a much smaller Qwen3-4B model, ClaimCheck achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 76.4% on the AVeriTeC dataset, outperforming previous approaches using LLaMA3.1 70B and GPT-4o. Extensive ablations demonstrate that careful modular design and prompting strategies can overcome the limitations of smaller LLMs. To promote accessibility and transparency, we provide a public demo at https://idir.uta.edu/claimcheck.

Current benchmarks, primarily based on the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO), may overstate models' abilities due to familiar problem types and data contamination. To provide a more comprehensive assessment, a new benchmark named EEFSUVA is introduced, sourced from lesser-known regional and national Olympiads with challenging nonstandard problems. Initial results indicate that even advanced LLMs struggle with EEFSUVA compared to traditional benchmarks. The study underscores the importance of diverse evaluation datasets for accurate measurement of mathematical reasoning skills and to guide future model improvements.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs) match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning. The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for guiding future model development.

Linear probing analysis of large language models revealed that conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with distinct subspaces for system-user and social conflicts. Direct Logit Attribution showed stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases but consistent resolution for social cues. Steering experiments demonstrated that despite using social cues, vectors amplify instruction following in a role-agnostic manner. These findings explain the fragile obedience of language models and emphasize the necessity for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive alignment methods.<br /><br />Summary: Linear probing analysis identified early encoding of conflict-decision signals, with distinct subspaces for different types of conflicts.

Abstract: Large language models should follow hierarchical instructions where system prompts override user inputs, yet recent work shows they often ignore this rule while strongly obeying social cues such as authority or consensus. We extend these behavioral findings with mechanistic interpretations on a large-scale dataset. Linear probing shows conflict-decision signals are encoded early, with system-user and social conflicts forming distinct subspaces. Direct Logit Attribution reveals stronger internal conflict detection in system-user cases but consistent resolution only for social cues. Steering experiments show that, despite using social cues, the vectors surprisingly amplify instruction following in a role-agnostic way. Together, these results explain fragile system obedience and underscore the need for lightweight hierarchy-sensitive alignment methods.

Abstract: Effective document reranking is essential for improving search relevance across diverse applications. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at reranking due to their deep semantic understanding and reasoning, their high computational cost makes them impractical for many real-world deployments. Fine-tuning smaller, task-specific models is a more efficient alternative but typically depends on scarce, manually labeled data. To overcome this, we propose a novel pipeline that eliminates the need for human-labeled query-document pairs. Our method uses LLMs to generate synthetic queries from domain-specific corpora and employs an LLM-based classifier to label positive and hard-negative pairs. This synthetic dataset is then used to fine-tune a smaller transformer model with contrastive learning using Localized Contrastive Estimation (LCE) loss. Experiments on the MedQuAD dataset show that our approach significantly boosts in-domain performance and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. By using LLMs for data generation and supervision rather than inference, we reduce computational costs while maintaining strong reranking capabilities.

Summary: 
The study examines geometric patterns in Chinese character embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. It identifies clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function words across various embedding models and dimensionality reduction methods. The analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters reveals a correlation between geometric complexity and semantic content, with meaningful characters showing rich geometric diversity. Additionally, the study demonstrates a systematic semantic expansion from elemental characters through a child-network analysis of 123 phrases.

Abstract: We systematically investigate geometric patterns in Chinese character embeddings using PHATE manifold analysis. Through cross-validation across seven embedding models and eight dimensionality reduction methods, we observe clustering patterns for content words and branching patterns for function words. Analysis of over 1000 Chinese characters across 12 semantic domains reveals that geometric complexity correlates with semantic content: meaningful characters exhibit rich geometric diversity while structural radicals collapse into tight clusters. The comprehensive child-network analysis (123 phrases) demonstrates systematic semantic expansion from elemental character. These findings provide computational evidence supporting traditional linguistic theory and establish a novel framework for geometric analysis of semantic organization.

<div> Keywords: automatic summarization, uncertainty quantification, risk-aware mechanisms, information overload, high-risk decision-making

Summary: 
This study introduces a large language model framework for automatic summarization in high-risk scenarios. By integrating uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms, the model aims to improve the reliability and trustworthiness of summaries while ensuring key information is accurately preserved. The conditional generation-based summarization model incorporates Bayesian inference to address uncertainty in the parameter space, leading to more accurate and less overconfident predictions. The model measures the uncertainty level of generated content using predictive distribution entropy and applies joint optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss to enhance the robustness of summarization. By incorporating risk scoring and regulation modules, the model provides explicit risk-level prompts in the summaries, improving their trustworthiness for high-risk decision-making scenarios. Experimental results and sensitivity analyses validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in maintaining fluency and semantic integrity while improving reliability and robustness in high-risk applications. This research offers a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization with practical value at the methodological level.

arXiv:2510.01231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts. Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity. This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.

<div> keywords: Large Language Models, Benchmark Profiling, Abilities, Model Interpretability, Benchmark Audit
Summary:
Benchmark Profiling introduces a method to assess the performance of Large Language Models on standard benchmarks by breaking down performance into ten cognitive abilities. It finds that most benchmarks require a mix of abilities, rather than just one, and datasets with similar labels may rely on different ability combinations. Code-generation benchmarks benefit from broad multi-skill improvement, with limited gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning. The presence of irrelevant abilities can negatively impact performance. This framework sheds light on why performance improvements on benchmarks may not correspond to actual user competence, offering a transparent tool for benchmark evaluation and model interpretability. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models are commonly judged by their scores on standard benchmarks, yet such scores often overstate real capability since they mask the mix of skills a task actually demands. For example, ARC is assumed to test reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii) datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii) code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and model interpretability.

Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities, latency and computational costs presents a critical deployment challenge: selecting the most suitable model for each prompt to optimize the trade-off between performance and efficiency. We introduce LLMRank, a prompt-aware routing framework that leverages rich, human-readable features extracted from prompts, including task type, reasoning patterns, complexity indicators, syntactic cues, and signals from a lightweight proxy solver. Unlike prior one-shot routers that rely solely on latent embeddings, LLMRank predicts per-model utility using a neural ranking model trained on RouterBench, comprising 36,497 prompts spanning 11 benchmarks and 11 state-of-the-art LLMs, from small efficient models to large frontier systems. Our approach achieves up to 89.2% of oracle utility, while providing interpretable feature attributions that explain routing decisions. Extensive studies demonstrate the importance of multifaceted feature extraction and the hybrid ranking objective, highlighting the potential of feature-driven routing for efficient and transparent LLM deployment.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical image analysis, yet their capacity for structured reasoning in complex domains like dermatology is often limited by data scarcity and the high computational cost of advanced training techniques. To address these challenges, we introduce DermIQ-VLM, a VLM developed through a multi-stage, resource-efficient methodology designed to emulate a dermatologist's diagnostic process. Our primary contribution is a modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++, which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Summary:
This article introduces a confidence-aware routing system for Large Language Models (LLMs) to reduce hallucination in generated content. The system proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation using signals such as semantic alignment, internal convergence analysis, and confidence estimation. Based on the unified confidence score, queries are redirected to different pathways: local generation, retrieval-augmented generation, larger models, or human review. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks shows improved hallucination detection and reduced computational costs compared to post-hoc methods. The F1 score also increases with low false positive rates, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proactive assessment approach in enhancing LLM reliability. This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment offers a computationally efficient way to improve the reliability of LLM-generated content. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models suffer from hallucination, generating plausible yet factually incorrect content. Current mitigation strategies focus on post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42 baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates (0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.

Summary: <br />
The study investigates the impact of padding tokens on large language models (LLMs). It explores how even small amounts of padding can affect hidden representations, degrade generation quality in smaller models, and unpredictably alter bias. The research also found that padding weakens safety guardrails in LLMs. The study conducted assessments across three open-source model families - Llama, Gemma, and Qwen - and evaluated outcomes on activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. The results show that the influence of padding tokens is not well understood and can pose robustness risks in LLM deployment. Hence, it is crucial to handle padding carefully to mitigate these risks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.01238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Padding tokens are widely used in large language models (LLMs) to equalize sequence lengths during batched inference. While they should be fully masked, implementation errors can cause them to influence computation, and the extent of this influence is not well understood. We systematically study this effect across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes: activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails. These findings demonstrate that padding is not a harmless detail but a robustness risk that must be carefully handled in deployment.

Summary:
CIFLEX introduces an execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn interactions using a single on-device large language model (LLM). Traditional approaches incur high computational overhead by reprocessing the entire conversation context when switching between main and sub-tasks. CIFLEX addresses this issue by reusing the main task's key-value cache and injecting task-specific instructions into isolated side paths for sub-task execution. The model seamlessly transitions back to the main path using cached context, eliminating redundant computation. Additionally, a hierarchical classification strategy is developed for sub-task selection, simplifying decision-making for smaller models. Experiments demonstrate that CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining task performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogues on-device. <div>

Abstract: We present CIFLEX (Contextual Instruction Flow for Sub-task Execution), which is a novel execution system for efficient sub-task handling in multi-turn interactions with a single on-device large language model (LLM). As LLMs become increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests. Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models, decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now perform strongly on many public math suites, yet frontier separation within mathematics increasingly suffers from ceiling effects. We present two complementary benchmarks: SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH, a 100-item, structure-aware diagnostic set with per-item metadata on length, numeric density, and symbolic complexity; and SKYLENAGE-MATH, a 150-item contest-style suite spanning four stages from high school to doctoral under a seven-subject taxonomy. We evaluate fifteen contemporary LLM variants under a single setup and analyze subject x model and grade x model performance. On the contest suite, the strongest model reaches 44% while the runner-up reaches 37%; accuracy declines from high school to doctoral, and top systems exhibit a doctoral-to-high-school retention near 79%. On the reasoning set, the best model attains 81% overall, and hardest-slice results reveal clear robustness gaps between leaders and the mid-tier. In summary, we release SKYLENAGE-ReasoningMATH and report aggregate results for SKYLENAGE-MATH; together, SKYLENAGE provides a hard, reasoning-centered and broadly covering math benchmark with calibrated difficulty and rich metadata, serving as a reference benchmark for future evaluations of mathematical reasoning.

- The Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a metric of memory aging derived from observable recall behavior.
- AAS is well-defined, bounded, and monotonic, applicable across various tasks and domains.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models, semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions, while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled, entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0), yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset, the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded, task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy, and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.

ARGRE models toxicity transitions within the latent representation space to provide stable and precise editing guidance. By identifying non-toxic semantic directions and interpolating between toxic and non-toxic representations, ARGRE transforms sparse toxicity annotations into dense training signals. At inference, ARGRE utilizes an autoregressive reward model to guide a two-step editing process that effectively detoxifies LLM representations. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs demonstrate that ARGRE outperforms leading baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency, reducing toxicity by 62.21% and inference time by 47.58%. This framework allows for safe and responsible deployment of LLMs while maintaining their core capabilities with minimal degradation. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content, necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To address this challenge, we propose \textsc{A}utoregressive \textsc{R}eward \textsc{G}uided \textsc{R}epresentation \textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance. At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions, followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.

Summary: 
The study focused on developing an ontology for mental stress, integrating theoretical models with concepts from stress assessment tools. MeSO identified six categories of stress-related information and refined its structure with expert validation. Using MeSO, stress-related information was extracted from Reddit posts using a Large Language Model (LLM). The final ontology included 181 concepts across eight top-level classes. The LLM correctly identified 78.2% of extractable stress-related items, with some misclassifications and missed items. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for structured extraction of stress-related information, potentially enhancing stress documentation in ambient AI systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison across LLMs.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors, individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses, significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream clinical utility.
  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology (MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert validation.
  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21 (9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although 24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.
  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison across LLMs.

<div> semantic synthesis pipeline, dynamic mobility prediction, multi-agent framework, LLM-based agents, progressive fusion architecture

Summary:
SeMob is a novel framework for dynamic mobility prediction that integrates textual descriptions of external events into spatiotemporal models. The system utilizes LLM-powered agents to extract and reason about relevant text data, which is then fused with spatiotemporal information using a progressive fusion architecture. By incorporating rich event priors, SeMob outperforms traditional spatiotemporal models, achieving significant reductions in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The framework demonstrates particular strength in predicting mobility patterns near event locations and times, highlighting its effectiveness in accounting for abrupt changes in human mobility. SeMob represents a promising approach to enhancing urban services by improving the accuracy of mobility forecasting models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Human mobility prediction is vital for urban services, but often fails to account for abrupt changes from external events. Existing spatiotemporal models struggle to leverage textual descriptions detailing these events. We propose SeMob, an LLM-powered semantic synthesis pipeline for dynamic mobility prediction. Specifically, SeMob employs a multi-agent framework where LLM-based agents automatically extract and reason about spatiotemporally related text from complex online texts. Fine-grained relevant contexts are then incorporated with spatiotemporal data through our proposed innovative progressive fusion architecture. The rich pre-trained event prior contributes enriched insights about event-driven prediction, and hence results in a more aligned forecasting model. Evaluated on a dataset constructed through our pipeline, SeMob achieves maximal reductions of 13.92% in MAE and 11.12% in RMSE compared to the spatiotemporal model. Notably, the framework exhibits pronounced superiority especially within spatiotemporal regions close to an event's location and time of occurrence.

<div> autoencoders, language model, steering, sparse, mathematical reasoning

Summary:
Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven to be effective in steering language models, but previous approaches focusing on top-k latents sometimes capture non-semantic features. This study suggests focusing on the most relevant SAE latent (top-1) to eliminate redundant features and enhance semantic attributes. The constant SAE steering method often leads to repetitive single words, so a token-wise decaying steering strategy is introduced to address this issue. By steering an SAE latent associated with reasoning, the model can effectively elicit step-by-step mathematical reasoning and improve inference quality, mimicking the effect of appending a guiding token. Empirical results show that SAEs outperform mean activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and achieve similar performance on IF-Eval. Overall, the proposed approach improves the quality of inference and reasoning in language models using sparse autoencoders. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for language model steering. Prior work has explored top-k SAE latents for steering, but we observe that many dimensions among the top-k latents capture non-semantic features such as punctuation rather than semantic attributes like instructions. To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match their performance on IF-Eval.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are primarily evaluated on globally popular sports, often overlooking regional and indigenous sporting traditions. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}}, a benchmark designed to assess LMs' understanding of traditional sports across 60 countries and 6 continents, encompassing four distinct cultural categories. The dataset features 33,000 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) across text and image modalities, each of which is categorized into three key types: history-based, rule-based, and scenario-based. To evaluate model performance, we employ zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across a diverse set of Large Language Models (LLMs), Small Language Models (SLMs), and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLMs). By providing a comprehensive multilingual and multicultural sports benchmark, \textbf{\textit{CultSportQA}} establishes a new standard for assessing AI's ability to understand and reason about traditional sports.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel structure aware self supervised learning method, SSTAG, designed for Text Attributed Graphs (TAGs). This method aims to bridge the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the structural modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance the scalability of large-scale TAGs. SSTAG utilizes a dual knowledge distillation framework to co-distill LLMs and GNNs into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Additionally, an in-memory mechanism is introduced to store typical graph representations and align them with memory anchors in an in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that SSTAG surpasses existing models in cross-domain transfer learning tasks, offers exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining competitive performance.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large scale pretrained models have revolutionized Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), showcasing remarkable cross domain generalization abilities. However, in graph learning, models are typically trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications. To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSTAG outperforms state-of-the-art models on cross-domain transfer learning tasks, achieves exceptional scalability, and reduces inference costs while maintaining competitive performance.

Summary:
LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation) is a framework designed to improve the reliability of scientific question-answering datasets used by Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing datasets often suffer from high error rates due to logical leaps and implicit reasoning in the answers. LOCA addresses this issue by enhancing raw answers, completing missing logical steps, and separating scientific principles from their derivations. By applying LOCA, noisy datasets can be filtered, reducing error rates from 20% to below 2%. This framework provides a scalable and effective method for creating high-quality scientific corpora, enabling more reliable training and evaluation of scientific AI.<br /><br />Summary: LOCA, a framework for enhancing scientific question-answering datasets, addresses high error rates by completing missing logical steps and improving the quality of scientific corpora used by Large Language Models. <div>

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general domains, their reliability often falls short in scientific problem-solving. The advancement of scientific AI depends on large-scale, high-quality corpora. However, existing scientific question-answering (QA) datasets suffer from high error rates, frequently resulting from logical leaps and implicit reasoning within the answers. To address this issue, we introduce LOCA (Logical Chain Augmentation), a novel framework for automatically cleaning scientific corpora, implemented through an augment-and-review loop. At its core, LOCA enhances raw answers by completing missing logical steps and explicitly separating the underlying scientific principle from its subsequent derivation. By applying LOCA to challenging scientific corpora, we demonstrate that it can automatically filter noisy datasets, typically reducing the error rate from as high as 20\% to below 2\%. LOCA provides a scalable and effective methodology for creating high-quality scientific corpora, paving the way for more reliable training and evaluation of scientific AI.

Abstract: As social-media platforms emerge and evolve faster than the regulations meant to oversee them, automated detoxification might serve as a timely tool for moderators to enforce safe discourse at scale. We here describe our submission to the PAN 2025 Multilingual Text Detoxification Challenge, which rewrites toxic single-sentence inputs into neutral paraphrases across 15 typologically diverse languages. Building on a 12B-parameter Gemma-3 multilingual transformer, we apply parameter-efficient LoRA SFT fine-tuning and prompting techniques like few-shot and Chain-of-Thought. Our multilingual training corpus combines 3,600 human-authored parallel pairs, 21,600 machine-translated synthetic pairs, and model-generated pairs filtered by Jaccard thresholds. At inference, inputs are enriched with three LaBSE-retrieved neighbors and explicit toxic-span annotations. Evaluated via Style Transfer Accuracy, LaBSE-based semantic preservation, and xCOMET fluency, our system ranks first on high-resource and low-resource languages. Ablations show +0.081 joint score increase from few-shot examples and +0.088 from basic CoT prompting. ANOVA analysis identifies language resource status as the strongest predictor of performance ($\eta^2$ = 0.667, p < 0.01).

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the challenge of linking textual values in tabular data to entities in a Knowledge Base using Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs excel at Entity Linking (EL), their practical deployment requires accurate predictions and reliable uncertainty estimates. The study explores a self-supervised approach to estimate uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing the need for resource-intensive multi-shot inference. Evaluation on an EL task reveals that the method effectively identifies low-accuracy outputs at a lower computational cost, making it a cost-effective solution for integrating uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows. By providing a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL workflows with minimal computational overhead, the approach enhances the usability and efficiency of LLMs in real-world applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference, posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows. The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL workflows with limited computational overhead.

Summary: 
Large language models (LLMs) are being trained on vast, unfiltered datasets, posing challenges in understanding their representations and the underlying data. By coupling LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs), this study explores the interpretability of not only model behavior but also the inherent structures, themes, and biases within the training data. Using a GPT-style transformer model trained exclusively on Jane Austen's novels, known for rich social constructs and narrative patterns, SAEs are applied to hidden states across different layers. This approach reveals sparse, interpretable features reflecting key narratives and concepts such as gender, class, and societal duty present in the corpus. The combination of LLMs and SAEs serves as scalable tools for delving into complex datasets, facilitating corpus exploration, bias identification, and model interpretability on a larger scale. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained on massive, uncurated corpora, understanding both model representations and the data they internalize has become a major challenge. In this work, we show that pairing LLMs with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) enables interpretation not only of model behavior but also of the deeper structures, themes, and biases embedded in the training data. We train a GPT-style transformer model exclusively on the novels of Jane Austen, a corpus rich in social constructs and narrative patterns. We then apply SAEs to hidden states across multiple layers, uncovering sparse, interpretable features that reflect the key narratives and concepts present in the corpus, including gender, class, and societal duty. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs combined with SAEs can act as scalable probes into complex datasets, offering a new path for corpus exploration, bias discovery, and model interpretability at scale.

Summary: <br />
Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in SpeechLLMs focused on MCQA formats, assuming model performance consistency across tasks. However, fine-tuning models to prefer stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or neutral/uncertain answers showed inconsistent generalization to other MCQA benchmarks and long-form tasks. Performance on MCQA bias benchmarks did not reliably predict across tasks, highlighting limited cross-task generalization in the speech domain. An evaluation suite is proposed for measuring behavior transferability in future models and benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2510.01254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work in benchmarking bias and fairness in speech large language models (SpeechLLMs) has relied heavily on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats. The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe that assumption.
  We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour transferability in future models and benchmarks.

Summary: 
The study focuses on the impact of opaque content moderation practices on the outputs of large language models (LLMs). The researchers introduce AI Watchman, a system designed to track and measure LLM refusals over time to provide transparency into this aspect of LLM behavior. By auditing Open AI's models, GPT-4.1, GPT-5, and DeepSeek in both English and Chinese, the study reveals that changes in company policies can be detected through AI Watchman, highlighting differences in content moderation practices between models. The research also categorizes different forms of refusal by LLMs. This work underscores the importance of longitudinal auditing in understanding and addressing the impact of company policies on LLM outputs, providing valuable insights for ensuring transparency and accountability in the use of these models.

arXiv:2510.01255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models' (LLMs') outputs are shaped by opaque and frequently-changing company content moderation policies and practices. LLM moderation often takes the form of refusal; models' refusal to produce text about certain topics both reflects company policy and subtly shapes public discourse. We introduce AI Watchman, a longitudinal auditing system to publicly measure and track LLM refusals over time, to provide transparency into an important and black-box aspect of LLMs. Using a dataset of over 400 social issues, we audit Open AI's moderation endpoint, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5, and DeepSeek (both in English and Chinese). We find evidence that changes in company policies, even those not publicly announced, can be detected by AI Watchman, and identify company- and model-specific differences in content moderation. We also qualitatively analyze and categorize different forms of refusal. This work contributes evidence for the value of longitudinal auditing of LLMs, and AI Watchman, one system for doing so.

Summary:
Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE) is a framework designed to improve knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) by refining reasoning paths, evaluating sufficiency, and exploring additional evidence. RJE enhances the performance of small-sized LLMs, such as GPT-4o-mini, by introducing specialized auxiliary modules like Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted Exploration. This approach outperforms existing baselines and allows small open-source LLMs with 3B and 8B parameters to achieve competitive results without fine-tuning. RJE reduces the number of LLM calls and token usage, improving efficiency in KGQA. <div>

Abstract: Knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) aims to answer natural language questions using knowledge graphs. Recent research leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance KGQA reasoning, but faces limitations: retrieval-based methods are constrained by the quality of retrieved information, while agent-based methods rely heavily on proprietary LLMs. To address these limitations, we propose Retrieval-Judgment-Exploration (RJE), a framework that retrieves refined reasoning paths, evaluates their sufficiency, and conditionally explores additional evidence. Moreover, RJE introduces specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively: Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant efficiency improvements.

Summary:
This study examines the political biases present in large language models (LLMs) used in artificial intelligence. By evaluating algorithmic political partisanship using a zero-shot classification approach, the researchers found an overall liberal-authoritarian alignment in the LLMs tested. The study also identified issues such as reasoning supersessions and canned refusals in the model responses. These biases stem from training data, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws, impacting public discourse. The research underscores the importance of understanding the psychological influences in human-computer interactions and how biases can shape political discourse, leading to either conformity or polarization in societies with different socio-political structures. <div>

Abstract: Amidst the rapid normalization of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), intelligent systems have come to dominate political discourse across information mediums. However, internalized political biases stemming from training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms, each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric. Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's pre-existing socio-political structures.

<div> Keywords: OpenAI, refusal behavior, language choice, evaluation awareness, reproducibility

Summary:
This study examines the impact of sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy on refusal behavior using OpenAI's gpt-oss-20b model. Various harm domains such as cyber threats and unsafe advice are tested, showing significant differences in assistance rates based on different prompts. The study also reveals that formal registers in German and French prompt leaks more compared to English prompts. A role-play scenario using a "Linux terminal" overrides context rules in many cases, highlighting the need for AI-assisted hardening to reduce leakage. Evaluation awareness is tested, showing inconsistencies in assistance rates for matched prompts. The study also finds that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures helpful outputs and raises concerns about reproducibility with different inference stacks. The researchers provide all data and code for reproducibility at the given GitHub repository. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We probe OpenAI's open-weights 20-billion-parameter model gpt-oss-20b to study how sociopragmatic framing, language choice, and instruction hierarchy affect refusal behavior. Across 80 seeded iterations per scenario, we test several harm domains including ZIP-bomb construction (cyber threat), synthetic card-number generation, minor-unsafe driving advice, drug-precursor indicators, and RAG context exfiltration. Composite prompts that combine an educator persona, a safety-pretext ("what to avoid"), and step-cue phrasing flip assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts. A "Linux terminal" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and measure frame-conditioned differences between matched "helpfulness" and "harmfulness" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising reproducibility concerns. We release prompts, seeds, outputs, and code for reproducible auditing at https://github.com/ndurner/gpt-oss-rt-run .

<div> vulnerabilities, biases, inaccuracies, cultural insensitivities, safety alignment  

Summary:<br /><br />Researchers identified vulnerabilities in OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, specifically focusing on its performance and safety in a low-resource language like Hausa. The study revealed biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's behavior, with potential for generating harmful and culturally insensitive content. The model's safety protocols were found to relax with polite language, leading to misinformation and hate speech outputs. Errors included misinformation on the safety of common substances, inability to distinguish between foods, and incorporation of demeaning proverbs. The issues were attributed to inadequate safety tuning in low-resource language contexts, highlighting a significant gap in red-teaming efforts. Recommendations were provided to address these flaws. <div>

Abstract: In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.

Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate. Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.

Summary:<br />
- The paper introduces Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR) as an inference-time technique for Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically, reducing the potential for generating harmful or inappropriate content.
- Experimental results show a significant reduction in attack success rates without additional training, maintaining original performance on benign tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of PSR in enhancing LLM safety.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically. Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\% to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method, where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to the input's risk profile.

<div> hallucination detection, diffusion large language models, TraceDet, denoising process, multi-step

Summary:
TraceDet is a novel framework designed to address the hallucination problem in Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs). Unlike existing detection methods for auto-regressive LLMs, TraceDet explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs to identify and detect hallucinations. By modeling the denoising process as an action trace and analyzing the informative sub-traces, TraceDet effectively detects hallucination signals that emerge throughout the multi-step denoising process. Experimental results on various D-LLMs show that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination detection, achieving a significant average gain in AUROC compared to baselines. This method provides a reliable solution for detecting hallucinations in D-LLMs, enhancing their reliability in real-world applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion large language models (D-LLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to auto-regressive LLMs (AR-LLMs). However, the hallucination problem in D-LLMs remains underexplored, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods are designed for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.

Summary: 
Sentiment analysis is crucial in understanding consumer sentiments, opinions, and preferences. The study explores the use of transformer-based BERT models and other large language models for sentiment analysis of Bangladesh e-commerce reviews. Fine-tuning the Llama-3.1-8B model on a subset of 4000 samples from the dataset yielded superior performance compared to other models, with an overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, and 90% respectively. The study highlights the effectiveness of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, LoRA and PEFT, in reducing computational overhead, making it suitable for resource-limited contexts. The results demonstrate the potential of large language models in sentiment analysis tasks, showcasing their ability to handle the complexity and diversity of written languages. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is an essential part of text analysis, which is a larger field that includes determining and evaluating the author's emotional state. This method is essential since it makes it easier to comprehend consumers' feelings, viewpoints, and preferences holistically. The introduction of large language models (LLMs), such as Llama, has greatly increased the availability of cutting-edge model applications, such as sentiment analysis. However, accurate sentiment analysis is hampered by the intricacy of written language and the diversity of languages used in evaluations. The viability of using transformer-based BERT models and other LLMs for sentiment analysis from Bangladesh e commerce reviews is investigated in this paper. A subset of 4000 samples from the original dataset of Bangla and English customer reviews was utilized to fine-tune the model. The fine tuned Llama-3.1-8B model outperformed other fine-tuned models, including Phi-3.5-mini-instruct, Mistral-7B-v0.1, DistilBERT-multilingual, mBERT, and XLM-R-base, with an overall accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 95.5%, 93%, 88%, 90%. The study emphasizes how parameter efficient fine-tuning methods (LoRA and PEFT) can lower computational overhead and make it appropriate for contexts with limited resources.

Summary:
The paper introduces TUMIX, an ensemble framework that combines multiple agents using different tool-use strategies to improve reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). By iteratively sharing and refining responses based on questions and previous answers, TUMIX achieved up to a 3.55% accuracy improvement over existing methods on different benchmarks. Agent diversity and quality play a crucial role, and using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs further enhances performance. TUMIX can stop refining responses once sufficient confidence is reached, maintaining performance at a lower inference cost. While additional scaling can lead to higher performance, it comes at a higher cost. In summary, TUMIX demonstrates the effectiveness of combining textual reasoning, coding, and search in LLM reasoning, showcasing the importance of agent diversity and auto-optimization for improved performance at manageable costs.

Abstract: While integrating tools like Code Interpreter and Search has significantly enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning in models like ChatGPT Agent and Gemini-Pro, practical guidance on optimal tool use is lacking. The core challenge is effectively combining textual reasoning, coding, and search for diverse questions. In this paper, we propose Tool-Use Mixture (TUMIX), an ensemble framework that runs multiple agents in parallel, each employing distinct tool-use strategies and answer paths. Agents in TUMIX iteratively share and refine responses based on the question and previous answers. In experiments, TUMIX achieves significant gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented and test-time scaling methods, delivering an average accuracy improvement of up to 3.55% over the best baseline on Gemini-2.5-Pro and Gemini-2.5-Flash across key reasoning benchmarks, with near-equal inference costs. We find that agent diversity and quality are crucial and can be enhanced by using LLMs to auto-optimize agent designs. Furthermore, TUMIX can halt refinement upon reaching sufficient confidence, preserving performance at only 49% of the inference cost. Further scaling can achieve higher performance, albeit at a greater cost.

<div> Keywords: Speculative decoding, Hierarchical Speculative Decoding, Early-exit models, Intermediate verification, High-throughput decoding

Summary:
Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HiSpec) is introduced to accelerate language model (LLM) inference by utilizing early-exit (EE) models for intermediate verification. The framework aims to reduce verification time and overheads while maintaining accuracy. HiSpec allows tokens to exit early by skipping layer traversal in the verification process. By reusing key-value caches and hidden states between models, HiSpec improves throughput by up to 2.01 times compared to single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy. The methodology periodically validates draft tokens accepted by the intermediate verifier against the target model to ensure accuracy. Evaluation using various benchmarks and models demonstrates the effectiveness of HiSpec in improving throughput and efficiency in speculative decoding tasks. <br /><br />Summary: HiSpec introduces a framework for high-throughput speculative decoding, leveraging early-exit models for efficient intermediate verification. By reusing resources and prioritizing accuracy through periodic validation, HiSpec significantly improves throughput and efficiency in language model inference tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.01336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a smaller draft model to speculate tokens that a larger target model verifies. Verification is often the bottleneck (e.g. verification is $4\times$ slower than token generation when a 3B model speculates for a 70B target model), but most prior works focus only on accelerating drafting. $\textit{``Intermediate"}$ verification reduces verification time by discarding inaccurate draft tokens early, but existing methods incur substantial training overheads in incorporating the intermediate verifier, increase the memory footprint to orchestrate the intermediate verification step, and compromise accuracy by relying on approximate heuristics.
  We propose $\underline{\textit{Hi}}\textit{erarchical }\underline{\textit{Spec}}\textit{ulative Decoding (HiSpec)}$, a framework for high-throughput speculative decoding that exploits $\textit{early-exit (EE) models}$ for low-overhead intermediate verification. EE models allow tokens to exit early by skipping layer traversal and are explicitly trained so that hidden states at selected layers can be interpreted, making them uniquely suited for intermediate verification without drastically increasing compute and memory overheads. To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the intermediate verifier against the target model. Our evaluations using various representative benchmarks and models show that HiSpec improves throughput by 1.28$\times$ on average and by up to 2.01$\times$ compared to the baseline single-layer speculation without compromising accuracy.

<div> Keyword: Large language models, Event-based questions, Causal reasoning, Temporal reasoning, Prompting framework

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are highly effective at general language tasks but often struggle with event-based questions that require causal or temporal reasoning. To address this limitation, a new prompting framework called TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question Answering) has been introduced. TAG-EQA injects causal event graphs into LLM inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements. It offers nine prompting configurations, combining different strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with various input modalities (text-only, graph-only, text+graph). Results on the TORQUESTRA benchmark show that TAG-EQA improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with significant gains in zero-shot and graph-augmented CoT prompting settings. This study demonstrates that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without the need for fine-tuning, providing a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general language tasks but often struggle with event-based questions-especially those requiring causal or temporal reasoning. We introduce TAG-EQA (Text-And-Graph for Event Question Answering), a prompting framework that injects causal event graphs into LLM inputs by converting structured relations into natural-language statements. TAG-EQA spans nine prompting configurations, combining three strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought) with three input modalities (text-only, graph-only, text+graph), enabling a systematic analysis of when and how structured knowledge aids inference. On the TORQUESTRA benchmark, TAG-EQA improves accuracy by 5% on average over text-only baselines, with gains up to 12% in zero-shot settings and 18% when graph-augmented CoT prompting is effective. While performance varies by model and configuration, our findings show that causal graphs can enhance event reasoning in LLMs without fine-tuning, offering a flexible way to encode structure in prompt-based QA.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel method for automatically evaluating Language Model responses using semantic embedding distances. The method efficiently matches target candidates with LM-generated text, providing a robust classification of responses at a low compute cost. Testing across various data sets and LM architectures, the method achieved a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of ~96% compared to human annotators. This structure-free evaluation approach addresses the limitations of existing methods, such as high cost and deviation from real-world conditions. By leveraging embeddings and semantic distances, the proposed method offers a practical and effective solution for evaluating LM responses in both model training and production settings. <div>
arXiv:2510.01469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automatic evaluation of Language Model (LM) responses is a critical piece in the development of benchmarks and metrics, both for model training and quality assessment of production model endpoints. The current approaches to response classification relies on methods that are too expensive (i.e. LLM-as-a-Judge) or that are far from real-world conditions (string-matching, logprob). In this paper, a structure-free evaluation method is presented. The method makes use of semantic embedding distances to match target candidates with arbitrary LM-generated text, resulting in a robust classification of the response at a relatively low compute cost (embedding models of less than $10B$ parameters). The results show a regression score of ~0.97 and an accuracy of ~96% against human annotators, tested over 3 data sets and 3 different LM architectures.

Abstract: Domain-specific quantitative reasoning remains a major challenge for large language models (LLMs), especially in fields requiring expert knowledge and complex question answering (QA). In this work, we propose Expert Question Decomposition (EQD), an approach designed to balance the use of domain knowledge with computational efficiency. EQD is built on a two-step fine-tuning framework and guided by a reward function that measures the effectiveness of generated sub-questions in improving QA outcomes. It requires only a few thousand training examples and a single A100 GPU for fine-tuning, with inference time comparable to zero-shot prompting. Beyond its efficiency, EQD outperforms state-of-the-art domain-tuned models and advanced prompting strategies. We evaluate EQD in the financial domain, characterized by specialized knowledge and complex quantitative reasoning, across four benchmark datasets. Our method consistently improves QA performance by 0.6% to 10.5% across different LLMs. Our analysis reveals an important insight: in domain-specific QA, a single supporting question often provides greater benefit than detailed guidance steps.

Abstract: While Transformer architectures have demonstrated impressive scalability across domains, they continue to face challenges in long-context reasoning, computational efficiency, and structural generalization - largely due to rigid layer stacking, dense attention, and reliance on positional encodings. We present ReSSFormer, a Recursive Sparse Structured Transformer that integrates three complementary innovations: Recurrent Reasoning & Memory Unit (R2MU) for iterative reasoning with bounded depth, Adaptive Sparse Attention Module (ASAM) for efficient and focused context selection, and Self-Organizing Encoder Structure (SOES) for position-free structure induction. ReSSFormer replaces conventional depth stacking with recurrent inference, substitutes full attention with token- and expert-level sparsity, and models latent token topology directly from content. Across language modeling, multi-hop QA, and structure-sensitive tasks, ReSSFormer consistently outperforms strong baselines under comparable FLOPs and parameter budgets, highlighting its scalability, efficiency, and structural flexibility.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Model, hidden states, verification, clustering, correctness 

Summary:
This paper addresses the challenge of assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs by leveraging the model's internal hidden states. It proposes a minimalist verifier called Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), which classifies correctness based on the trajectory of hidden activations. The method does not have trainable parameters and outperforms existing methods in verifying LLM outputs. By analyzing hidden states, Clue identifies a geometrically separable signature that indicates the correctness of a solution. Empirical results show that Clue improves accuracy in reranking candidates across different datasets, including AIME 24/25 and GPQA. In particular, on AIME 24 with a 1.5B model, Clue significantly enhances accuracy compared to majority-vote and confidence-based methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of utilizing hidden states for verification tasks.

Abstract: Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information (e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues, or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure'' clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24 with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0% (top-maj@16).

<br />
Summary: 
In this study, various fine-tuning strategies for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines were evaluated and compared. RAG utilizes two large language models (LLMs) to retrieve relevant context documents and generate answers to questions. The fine-tuning strategies assessed included independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. The research findings indicated that all strategies led to comparable enhancements in EM and F1 generation quality metrics but varied in computational costs. The optimal approach depends on factors such as the presence of context labels in the training dataset and the necessity of a grid search over learning rates for the embedding and generator models. Ultimately, the study underscores the importance of selecting the most suitable fine-tuning strategy based on specific task requirements and computational considerations.

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models (LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the embedding and generator models is required.

Summary: 
RAG-BioQA is a novel framework developed to address the challenges posed by the exponential growth of biomedical literature by producing evidence-based, long-form answers for clinical decision-making. The framework combines retrieval-augmented generation with domain-specific fine-tuning, utilizing BioBERT embeddings and FAISS indexing. Various re-ranking strategies such as BM25, ColBERT, and MonoT5 are compared to optimize context selection before synthesizing evidence through a fine-tuned T5 model. Experimental results on the PubMedQA dataset demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, with the best model showing substantial gains in BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR metrics. This advancement in accessible, evidence-based biomedical knowledge retrieval showcases the effectiveness of the RAG-BioQA framework in providing comprehensive explanations for medical information access.

<div> Keywords: Small Language Models, Traditional Chinese, PureTC-1B, Continual Pre-Training, Language Stability

Summary: 
Small Language Models (SLMs) are valuable for on-device AI applications in Traditional Chinese (TC), but face token-level instability issues. In response, PureTC-1B was developed, using a three-stage stabilization pipeline with LoRA adapters to enhance monolingual robustness. The pipeline includes Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric data, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using TC-adherence preferences. PureTC-1B showed a 51.3% reduction in non-TC output tokens compared to the base model and significant improvements in Named Entity Translation (NET) tasks. These results demonstrate that robust TC adherence is achievable even at the 1B model scale. The reproducible, adapter-only pipeline is practical and hardware-friendly, providing a solution for enhancing language stability in TC and potentially other non-English languages.

Abstract: Small Language Models (SLMs) enable cost-effective, on-device and latency-sensitive AI applications, yet their deployment in Traditional Chinese (TC) remains hindered by token-level instability - models unpredictably emit non-TC characters or code-switch into other languages. We address this practical reliability gap by creating PureTC-1B, a three-stage stabilization pipeline for Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct (an open-weight, instruction-tuned model released by Meta) using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters. Our method combines Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and 57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.

<title>AMAS: Adaptively Determining Communication Topology for LLM-based Multi-Agent System</title>

arXiv:2510.01617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing capabilities, their practical implementation as autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) for industrial problem-solving encounters persistent barriers. Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness, resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from a range of vulnerabilities that allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of the input text. These so-called jailbreak prompts are designed to trick the LLM into circumventing the safety guardrails put in place to keep responses acceptable to the developer's policies. In this study, we analyse the ability of different machine learning models to distinguish jailbreak prompts from genuine uses, including looking at our ability to identify jailbreaks that use previously unseen strategies. Our results indicate that using current datasets the best performance is achieved by fine tuning a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model end-to-end for identifying jailbreaks. We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a signal of jailbreak intention.

Abstract: Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance in language understanding and generation. However, their application in text embedding tasks has been relatively slow, along with the analysis of their semantic representation in probing tasks, due to the constraints of the unidirectional attention mechanism.
  This paper aims to explore whether such constraints can be overcome by enabling bidirectional attention in LLMs. We tested different variants of the Llama architecture through additional training steps, progressively enabling bidirectional attention and unsupervised/supervised contrastive learning.

Abstract: Cybersecurity is a relentless arms race, with AI driven offensive systems evolving faster than traditional defenses can adapt. Research and tooling remain fragmented across isolated defensive functions, creating blind spots that adversaries exploit. Autonomous agents capable of integrating, exploit confirmation, remediation, and validation into a single closed loop offer promise, but the field lacks three essentials: a framework defining the agentic capabilities of security systems across security life cycle, a principled method for evaluating closed loop agents, and a benchmark for measuring their performance in practice. We introduce CLASP: the Closed-Loop Autonomous Security Performance framework which aligns the security lifecycle (reconnaissance, exploitation, root cause analysis, patch synthesis, validation) with core agentic capabilities (planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, reflection & perception) providing a common vocabulary and rubric for assessing agentic capabilities in security tasks. By applying CLASP to 21 representative works, we map where systems demonstrate strengths, and where capability gaps persist. We then define the Closed-Loop Capability (CLC) Score, a composite metric quantifying both degree of loop closure and operational effectiveness, and outline the requirements for a closed loop benchmark. Together, CLASP and the CLC Score, provide the vocabulary, diagnostics, and measurements needed to advance both function level performance and measure closed loop security agents.

Abstract: Multimodal Dialogue Summarization (MDS) is a critical task with wide-ranging applications. To support the development of effective MDS models, robust automatic evaluation methods are essential for reducing both cost and human effort. However, such methods require a strong meta-evaluation benchmark grounded in human annotations. In this work, we introduce MDSEval, the first meta-evaluation benchmark for MDS, consisting image-sharing dialogues, corresponding summaries, and human judgments across eight well-defined quality aspects. To ensure data quality and richfulness, we propose a novel filtering framework leveraging Mutually Exclusive Key Information (MEKI) across modalities. Our work is the first to identify and formalize key evaluation dimensions specific to MDS. We benchmark state-of-the-art modal evaluation methods, revealing their limitations in distinguishing summaries from advanced MLLMs and their susceptibility to various bias.

Abstract: Reasoning protocols such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT) organize internal deliberation but lack an explicit mechanism for external questioning that elicits self-revision. We present FOR-Prompting (From Objection to Revision Prompting), an asymmetric protocol where a Defender proposes an answer, an Objectioner raises question-style objections with no direct fixes, and a Host enforces consistency and closure. On GSM8K we observe about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1 judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19% accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.

<title>How Do Language Models Compose Functions?</title>

arXiv:2510.01685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) appear to be increasingly capable of solving compositional tasks, it is an open question whether they do so using compositional mechanisms. In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as $g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the "compositionality gap": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y = g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$. Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\textit{compositionally}$, computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves them $\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in the embedding spaces. We fully release our data and code at: https://github.com/apoorvkh/composing-functions .

<title>Format Inertia: A Failure Mechanism of LLMs in Medical Pre-Consultation</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have brought significant improvements to various service domains, including chatbots and medical pre-consultation applications. In the healthcare domain, the most common approach for adapting LLMs to multi-turn dialogue generation is Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, datasets for SFT in tasks like medical pre-consultation typically exhibit a skewed turn-count distribution. Training on such data induces a novel failure mechanism we term **Format Inertia**, where models tend to generate repetitive, format-correct, but diagnostically uninformative questions in long medical dialogues. To mitigate this observed failure mechanism, we adopt a simple, data-centric method that rebalances the turn-count distribution of the training dataset. Experimental results show that our approach substantially alleviates Format Inertia in medical pre-consultation.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning models have recently shown promise on challenging domains such as olympiad-level geometry, yet their evaluation remains dominated by aggregate accuracy, a single score that obscures where and how models are improving. We introduce MathLens, a benchmark designed to disentangle the subskills of multimodal reasoning while preserving the complexity of textbook-style geometry problems. The benchmark separates performance into three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs, Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First, reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally, robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and experimental logs.

Abstract: Engineering design processes use technical specifications and must comply with standards. Product specifications, product type data sheets, and design standards are still mainly document-centric despite the ambition to digitalize industrial work. In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable, machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format, and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS 23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO).
  We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset. We create "functional location tags" as OWL individuals that become instances of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards. Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart Standards.

<title>Can LLMs Refuse Questions They Do Not Know? Measuring Knowledge-Aware Refusal in Factual Tasks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01782</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs. Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in legal natural language processing demands scalable methods for evaluating text extraction from judicial decisions. This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168 expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based, semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories, operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE = 0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC = 0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density (Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches, enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values, cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts.

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has enabled the generation of highly persuasive spam reviews that closely mimic human writing. These reviews pose significant challenges for existing detection systems and threaten the credibility of online platforms. In this work, we first create three realistic LLM-generated spam review datasets using three distinct LLMs, each guided by product metadata and genuine reference reviews. Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution for real-world applications. Our contributions include new synthetic datasets, a practical detection framework, and empirical evidence highlighting the urgency of adapting spam detection to the LLM era. Our code and datasets are available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FraudSquad-5389/.

<title>Syntactic Blind Spots: How Misalignment Leads to LLMs Mathematical Errors</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong mathematical problem-solving abilities but frequently fail on problems that deviate syntactically from their training distribution. We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.

Abstract: Semi-structured content in HTML tables, lists, and infoboxes accounts for a substantial share of factual data on the web, yet the formatting complicates usage, and reliably extracting structured information from them remains challenging. Existing methods either lack generalization or are resource-intensive due to per-page LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be applied to groups of structurally similar webpages. Our approach further improves by iteratively training on synthetic annotations from in-the-wild CommonCrawl data. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong baselines by over 13% in script quality and boosts downstream question answering accuracy by more than 4% for GPT-4o, enabling scalable and resource-efficient web information extraction.

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language model literature is that these models tend to underperform in \textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal performance.

Abstract: Post-training for large language models (LLMs) is constrained by the high cost of acquiring new knowledge or correcting errors and by the unintended side effects that frequently arise from retraining. To address these issues, we introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management. Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects. Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30% across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting. This work introduces a robust framework for developing reliable, scalable, and continually evolving LLMs.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in enhancing the reasoning performance of LLMs. For example, they can provide training signals to finetune LLMs during reinforcement learning (RL) and help select the best answer from multiple candidates during inference. In this paper, we provide a systematic introduction to RMs, along with a comprehensive survey of their applications in LLM reasoning. We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on existing research and our own empirical findings. Our analysis aims to provide actionable insights for the effective deployment and advancement of RMs for LLM reasoning.

<title>Inverse Language Modeling towards Robust and Grounded LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.01929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current landscape of defensive mechanisms for LLMs is fragmented and underdeveloped, unlike prior work on classifiers. To further promote adversarial robustness in LLMs, we propose Inverse Language Modeling (ILM), a unified framework that simultaneously 1) improves the robustness of LLMs to input perturbations, and, at the same time, 2) enables native grounding by inverting model outputs to identify potentially toxic or unsafe input triggers. ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems, potentially helping RED teaming. ILM can lay the foundation for next-generation LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more controllable and trustworthy. The code is publicly available at github.com/davegabe/pag-llm.

<title>Veri-R1: Toward Precise and Faithful Claim Verification via Online Reinforcement Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.01932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Claim verification with large language models (LLMs) has recently attracted considerable attention, owing to their superior reasoning capabilities and transparent verification pathways compared to traditional answer-only judgments. Online claim verification requires iterative evidence retrieval and reasoning, yet existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering or predesigned reasoning workflows without offering a unified training paradigm to improve necessary skills. Therefore, we introduce Veri-R1, an online reinforcement learning (RL) framework that enables an LLM to interact with a search engine and to receive reward signals that explicitly shape its planning, retrieval, and reasoning behaviors. The dynamic interaction between models and retrieval systems more accurately reflects real-world verification scenarios and fosters comprehensive verification skills. Empirical results show that Veri-R1 improves joint accuracy by up to 30% and doubles evidence score, often surpassing larger-scale counterparts. Ablation studies further reveal the impact of reward components and the link between output logits and label accuracy. Our results highlight the effectiveness of online RL for precise and faithful claim verification and provide a foundation for future research. We release our code to support community progress in LLM empowered claim verification.

<title>Taking a SEAT: Predicting Value Interpretations from Sentiment, Emotion, Argument, and Topic Annotations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.01976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our interpretation of value concepts is shaped by our sociocultural background and lived experiences, and is thus subjective. Recognizing individual value interpretations is important for developing AI systems that can align with diverse human perspectives and avoid bias toward majority viewpoints. To this end, we investigate whether a language model can predict individual value interpretations by leveraging multi-dimensional subjective annotations as a proxy for their interpretive lens. That is, we evaluate whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion, Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the incorporation of individual subjective annotators. To the best of our knowledge, this controlled setting, although small in size, is the first attempt to go beyond demographics and investigate the impact of annotation behavior on value prediction, providing a solid foundation for future large-scale validation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.01989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schema design, particularly normalization, is a critical yet often overlooked factor in natural language to SQL (NL2SQL) systems. Most prior research evaluates models on fixed schemas, overlooking the influence of design on performance. We present the first systematic study of schema normalization's impact, evaluating eight leading large language models on synthetic and real-world datasets with varied normalization levels. We construct controlled synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF) introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the types of queries to be supported. Our study demonstrates the importance of considering schema design when developing NL2SQL interfaces and integrating adaptive schema selection for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Online social media platforms are central to everyday communication and information seeking. While these platforms serve positive purposes, they also provide fertile ground for the spread of hate speech, offensive language, and bullying content targeting individuals, organizations, and communities. Such content undermines safety, participation, and equity online. Reliable detection systems are therefore needed, especially for low-resource languages where moderation tools are limited. In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset, BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded pretraining remains critical for robust performance. Together, our dataset and findings establish a stronger benchmark for developing culturally aligned moderation tools in low-resource contexts. For reproducibility, we will release the dataset and all related scripts.

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs)' creativity have focused primarily on the quality of their outputs rather than the processes that shape them. This study takes a process-oriented approach, drawing on narratology to examine LLMs as computational authors. We introduce constraint-based decision-making as a lens for authorial creativity. Using controlled prompting to assign authorial personas, we analyze the creative preferences of the models. Our findings show that LLMs consistently emphasize Style over other elements, including Character, Event, and Setting. By also probing the reasoning the models provide for their choices, we show that distinctive profiles emerge across models and argue that our approach provides a novel systematic tool for analyzing AI's authorial creativity.

<title>Stream RAG: Instant and Accurate Spoken Dialogue Systems with Streaming Tool Usage</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02044</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.02044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural, expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200% relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for more agentic, real-time AI assistants.

<title>Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Streaming Full-Duplex End-to-End Spoken Dialogue Systems</title>

Abstract: Most end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue systems (SDS) rely on voice activity detection (VAD) for turn-taking, but VAD fails to distinguish between pauses and turn completions. Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block. Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.

Abstract: The practice of speculative decoding, whereby inference is probabilistically supported by a smaller, cheaper, ``drafter'' model, has become a standard technique for systematically reducing the decoding time of large language models. This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs, revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.

<title>RESTRAIN: From Spurious Votes to Signals -- Self-Driven RL with Self-Penalization</title>

arXiv:2510.02172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human-annotated data has boosted chain-of-thought reasoning in large reasoning models, but these gains come at high costs in labeled data while faltering on harder tasks. A natural next step is experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO, enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data. With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to +140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels. These results demonstrate that RESTRAIN establishes a scalable path toward stronger reasoning without gold labels.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate hallucinations -- unsupported content that undermines reliability. While most prior works frame hallucination detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.

Abstract: Interacting with knowledge graphs can be a daunting task for people without a background in computer science since the query language that is used (SPARQL) has a high barrier of entry. Large language models (LLMs) can lower that barrier by providing support in the form of Text2SPARQL translation. In this paper we introduce a generalized method based on SPINACH, an LLM backed agent that translates natural language questions to SPARQL queries not in a single shot, but as an iterative process of exploration and execution. We describe the overall architecture and reasoning behind our design decisions, and also conduct a thorough analysis of the agent behavior to gain insights into future areas for targeted improvements. This work was motivated by the Text2SPARQL challenge, a challenge that was held to facilitate improvements in the Text2SPARQL domain.

<title>Say One Thing, Do Another? Diagnosing Reasoning-Execution Gaps in VLM-Powered Mobile-Use Agents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02204</link>

arXiv:2510.02204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps, which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment (GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM) metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy. This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i) Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap, sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.

<title>More Than One Teacher: Adaptive Multi-Guidance Policy Optimization for Diverse Exploration</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02227</link>

arXiv:2510.02227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy model fails to generate correct solutions. This "guidance-on-demand" approach expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover, AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend, thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability. Our code is available at https://github.com/SII-Enigma/AMPO.

Abstract: Recent technological advances in smartphones and communications, including the growth of such online platforms as massive social media networks such as X (formerly known as Twitter) endangers young people and their emotional well-being by exposing them to cyberbullying, taunting, and bullying content. Most proposed approaches for automatically detecting cyberbullying have been developed around the English language, and methods for detecting Arabic-language cyberbullying are scarce. Methods for detecting Arabic-language cyberbullying are especially scarce. This paper aims to enhance the effectiveness of methods for detecting cyberbullying in Arabic-language content. We assembled a dataset of 10,662 X posts, pre-processed the data, and used the kappa tool to verify and enhance the quality of our annotations. We conducted four experiments to test numerous deep learning models for automatically detecting Arabic-language cyberbullying. We first tested a long short-term memory (LSTM) model and a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model with several experimental word embeddings. We also tested the LSTM and Bi-LSTM models with a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder from representations (BERT) and then tested them on a different experimental models BERT again. LSTM-BERT and Bi-LSTM-BERT demonstrated a 97% accuracy. Bi-LSTM with FastText embedding word performed even better, achieving 98% accuracy. As a result, the outcomes are generalize

<title>Explore Briefly, Then Decide: Mitigating LLM Overthinking via Cumulative Entropy Regulation</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities on complex problems using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, they often suffer from overthinking, meaning generating unnecessarily lengthy reasoning steps for simpler problems. This issue may degrade the efficiency of the models and make them difficult to adapt the reasoning depth to the complexity of problems. To address this, we introduce a novel metric Token Entropy Cumulative Average (TECA), which measures the extent of exploration throughout the reasoning process. We further propose a novel reasoning paradigm -- Explore Briefly, Then Decide -- with an associated Cumulative Entropy Regulation (CER) mechanism. This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.

<title>InfoMosaic-Bench: Evaluating Multi-Source Information Seeking in Tool-Augmented Agents</title>

Abstract: Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However, existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains (medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration), InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still struggle with even basic tool handling.

<title>Parallel Scaling Law: Unveiling Reasoning Generalization through A Cross-Linguistic Perspective</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in Reinforcement Post-Training (RPT) have significantly enhanced the capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), sparking increased interest in the generalization of RL-based reasoning. While existing work has primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question: $\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization. To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental results yield three key findings: $\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single parallel language, and a predictable $\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as $\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs fail to fully generalize across languages. Our study challenges the assumption that LRM reasoning mirrors human cognition, providing critical insights for the development of more language-agnostic LRMs.

Abstract: We introduce VLM-Lens, a toolkit designed to enable systematic benchmarking, analysis, and interpretation of vision-language models (VLMs) by supporting the extraction of intermediate outputs from any layer during the forward pass of open-source VLMs. VLM-Lens provides a unified, YAML-configurable interface that abstracts away model-specific complexities and supports user-friendly operation across diverse VLMs. It currently supports 16 state-of-the-art base VLMs and their over 30 variants, and is extensible to accommodate new models without changing the core logic.
  The toolkit integrates easily with various interpretability and analysis methods. We demonstrate its usage with two simple analytical experiments, revealing systematic differences in the hidden representations of VLMs across layers and target concepts. VLM-Lens is released as an open-sourced project to accelerate community efforts in understanding and improving VLMs.

Abstract: We introduce F2LLM - Foundation to Feature Large Language Models, a suite of state-of-the-art embedding models in three sizes: 0.6B, 1.7B, and 4B. Unlike previous top-ranking embedding models that require massive contrastive pretraining, sophisticated training pipelines, and costly synthetic training data, F2LLM is directly finetuned from foundation models on 6 million query-document-negative tuples curated from open-source, non-synthetic datasets, striking a strong balance between training cost, model size, and embedding performance. On the MTEB English leaderboard, F2LLM-4B ranks 2nd among models with approximately 4B parameters and 7th overall, while F2LLM-1.7B ranks 1st among models in the 1B-2B size range. To facilitate future research in the field, we release the models, training dataset, and code, positioning F2LLM as a strong, reproducible, and budget-friendly baseline for future works.

<title>Drawing Conclusions from Draws: Rethinking Preference Semantics in Arena-Style LLM Evaluation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02306</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.02306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the "battle" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically, we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of 1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.

<title>Control the Temperature: Selective Sampling for Diverse and High-Quality LLM Outputs</title>

Abstract: Diversity is an essential metric for evaluating the creativity of outputs generated by language models. Temperature-based sampling is a common strategy to increase diversity. However, for tasks that require high precision, e.g., mathematical reasoning, uncontrolled high temperature sampling, e.g., min-$p$ or top-$p$, degrades reasoning quality. We demonstrate that the loss of accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \textbf{selective sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency overhead. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that selective sampling enhances the quality-diversity trade-off, even in high-temperature settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various tasks. However, they remain exposed to jailbreak attacks, eliciting harmful responses. The nested scenario strategy has been increasingly adopted across various methods, demonstrating immense potential. Nevertheless, these methods are easily detectable due to their prominent malicious intentions. In this work, we are the first to find and systematically verify that LLMs' alignment defenses are not sensitive to nested scenarios, where these scenarios are highly semantically relevant to the queries and incorporate targeted toxic knowledge. This is a crucial yet insufficiently explored direction. Based on this, we propose RTS-Attack (Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with Targeted Toxic Knowledge), an adaptive and automated framework to examine LLMs' alignment. By building scenarios highly relevant to the queries and integrating targeted toxic knowledge, RTS-Attack bypasses the alignment defenses of LLMs. Moreover, the jailbreak prompts generated by RTS-Attack are free from harmful queries, leading to outstanding concealment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RTS-Attack exhibits superior performance in both efficiency and universality compared to the baselines across diverse advanced LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, and Gemini-pro. Our complete code is available in the supplementary material. WARNING: THIS PAPER CONTAINS POTENTIALLY HARMFUL CONTENT.

Abstract: The exponential growth of information presents a significant challenge for researchers and professionals seeking to remain at the forefront of their fields and this paper introduces an innovative framework for automatically generating insightful financial digests using the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Google's Gemini Pro. By leveraging a combination of data extraction from OpenAlex, strategic prompt engineering, and LLM-driven analysis, we demonstrate the automated example of creating a comprehensive digests that generalize key findings, identify emerging trends. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional analysis methods, enabling the efficient processing of vast amounts of unstructured data and the delivery of actionable insights in an easily digestible format. This paper describes how LLMs work in simple words and how we can use their power to help researchers and scholars save their time and stay informed about current trends. Our study includes step-by-step process, from data acquisition and JSON construction to interaction with Gemini and the automated generation of PDF reports, including a link to the project's GitHub repository for broader accessibility and further development.

Abstract: The rapid discovery of materials is constrained by the lack of large, machine-readable datasets that couple performance metrics with structural context. Existing databases are either small, manually curated, or biased toward first principles results, leaving experimental literature underexploited. We present an agentic, large language model (LLM)-driven workflow that autonomously extracts thermoelectric and structural-properties from about 10,000 full-text scientific articles. The pipeline integrates dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on 50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91 for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1 Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow, we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units, spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity, power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing broader structure-property correlations. To facilitate community access, we release an interactive web explorer with semantic filters, numeric queries, and CSV export. This study delivers the largest LLM-curated thermoelectric dataset to date, provides a reproducible and cost-profiled extraction pipeline, and establishes a foundation for scalable, data-driven materials discovery beyond thermoelectrics.

<title>RSAVQ: Riemannian Sensitivity-Aware Vector Quantization for Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01240</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.01240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in 2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by 0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing efficient deep learning.

<title>RLP: Reinforcement as a Pretraining Objective</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.01265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data. Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning. While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning. Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training, the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2 increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and model sizes.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new opportunities in data science, yet their practical deployment is often constrained by the challenge of discovering relevant data within large heterogeneous data lakes. Existing methods struggle with this: single-agent systems are quickly overwhelmed by large, heterogeneous files in the large data lakes, while multi-agent systems designed based on a master-slave paradigm depend on a rigid central controller for task allocation that requires precise knowledge of each sub-agent's capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-agent communication paradigm inspired by the blackboard architecture for traditional AI models. In this framework, a central agent posts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents -- either responsible for a partition of the data lake or general information retrieval -- volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design improves scalability and flexibility by eliminating the need for a central coordinator to have prior knowledge of all sub-agents' expertise. We evaluate our method on three benchmarks that require explicit data discovery: KramaBench and modified versions of DS-Bench and DA-Code to incorporate data discovery. Experimental results demonstrate that the blackboard architecture substantially outperforms baselines, including RAG and the master-slave multi-agent paradigm, achieving between 13% to 57% relative improvement in end-to-end task success and up to a 9% relative gain in F1 score for data discovery over the best-performing baselines across both proprietary and open-source LLMs. Our findings establish the blackboard paradigm as a scalable and generalizable communication framework for multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks, existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion. Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g., increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\times$ 2 setting) but also demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement learning data. The code and datasets is available at https://github.com/yuzeng0-0/AGILE .

Abstract: Recent works on context and memory benchmarking have primarily focused on conversational instances but the need for evaluating memory in dynamic enterprise environments is crucial for its effective application. We introduce MEMTRACK, a benchmark designed to evaluate long-term memory and state tracking in multi-platform agent environments. MEMTRACK models realistic organizational workflows by integrating asynchronous events across multiple communication and productivity platforms such as Slack, Linear and Git. Each benchmark instance provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy, conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\% Correctness score on MEMTRACK. This work provides an extensible framework for advancing evaluation research for memory-augmented agents, beyond existing focus on conversational setups, and sets the stage for multi-agent, multi-platform memory benchmarking in complex organizational settings

Abstract: Multiple prompt injection attacks have been proposed against web agents. At the same time, various methods have been developed to detect general prompt injection attacks, but none have been systematically evaluated for web agents. In this work, we bridge this gap by presenting the first comprehensive benchmark study on detecting prompt injection attacks targeting web agents. We begin by introducing a fine-grained categorization of such attacks based on the threat model. We then construct datasets containing both malicious and benign samples: malicious text segments generated by different attacks, benign text segments from four categories, malicious images produced by attacks, and benign images from two categories. Next, we systematize both text-based and image-based detection methods. Finally, we evaluate their performance across multiple scenarios. Our key findings show that while some detectors can identify attacks that rely on explicit textual instructions or visible image perturbations with moderate to high accuracy, they largely fail against attacks that omit explicit instructions or employ imperceptible perturbations. Our datasets and code are released at: https://github.com/Norrrrrrr-lyn/WAInjectBench.

Abstract: Reward hacking, where a reasoning model exploits loopholes in a reward function to achieve high rewards without solving the intended task, poses a significant threat. This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE (Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task. This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation. Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2) uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization. Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop (online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents, achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures (ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime dependencies.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly "box" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs, show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average. Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual variations. We introduce $\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text) to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context, VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the symmetric KL divergence between a "raw" and "noisy" branch, creating a direct signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales (Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks, while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Since the release of Deepseek-R1, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a central approach for training large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Data from online job postings are difficult to access and are not built in a standard or transparent manner. Data included in the standard taxonomy and occupational information database (O*NET) are updated infrequently and based on small survey samples. We adopt O*NET as a framework for building natural language processing tools that extract structured information from job postings. We publish the Job Ad Analysis Toolkit (JAAT), a collection of open-source tools built for this purpose, and demonstrate its reliability and accuracy in out-of-sample and LLM-as-a-Judge testing. We extract more than 10 billion data points from more than 155 million online job ads provided by the National Labor Exchange (NLx) Research Hub, including O*NET tasks, occupation codes, tools, and technologies, as well as wages, skills, industry, and more features. We describe the construction of a dataset of occupation, state, and industry level features aggregated by monthly active jobs from 2015 - 2025. We illustrate the potential for research and future uses in education and workforce development.

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging. In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

<title>Information Seeking for Robust Decision Making under Partial Observability</title>

Abstract: Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding, detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74% absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable environments.

Abstract: We present InvThink, a simple yet powerful approach that gives large language models (LLMs) the capability of inverse thinking: reasoning through failure modes before generating responses. Unlike existing safety alignment methods that optimize directly for safe response, InvThink instructs models to 1) enumerate potential harms, 2) analyze their consequences, and 3) generate safe outputs that proactively avoid these risks. Our method reveals three key findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing (medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios, achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families. These results suggest that inverse reasoning provides a scalable and generalizable path toward safer, more capable language models.

<title>Synthetic Prefixes to Mitigate Bias in Real-Time Neural Query Autocomplete</title>

Abstract: We introduce a data-centric approach for mitigating presentation bias in real-time neural query autocomplete systems through the use of synthetic prefixes. These prefixes are generated from complete user queries collected during regular search sessions where autocomplete was not active. This allows us to enrich the training data for learning to rank models with more diverse and less biased examples. This method addresses the inherent bias in engagement signals collected from live query autocomplete interactions, where model suggestions influence user behavior. Our neural ranker is optimized for real-time deployment under strict latency constraints and incorporates a rich set of features, including query popularity, seasonality, fuzzy match scores, and contextual signals such as department affinity, device type, and vertical alignment with previous user queries. To support efficient training, we introduce a task-specific simplification of the listwise loss, reducing computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the query autocomplete structure of having only one ground-truth selection per prefix. Deployed in a large-scale e-commerce setting, our system demonstrates statistically significant improvements in user engagement, as measured by mean reciprocal rank and related metrics. Our findings show that synthetic prefixes not only improve generalization but also provide a scalable path toward bias mitigation in other low-latency ranking tasks, including related searches and query recommendations.

<title>Think Right: Learning to Mitigate Under-Over Thinking via Adaptive, Attentive Compression</title>

Abstract: Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning (overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks (AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8% compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization: although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH, and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression yields gains across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Recent research has explored using Large Language Models for recommendation tasks by transforming user interaction histories and item metadata into text prompts, then having the LLM produce rankings or recommendations. A promising approach involves connecting collaborative filtering knowledge to LLM representations through compact adapter networks, which avoids expensive fine-tuning while preserving the strengths of both components. Yet several challenges persist in practice: collaborative filtering models often use static snapshots that miss rapidly changing user preferences; many real-world items contain rich visual and audio content beyond textual descriptions; and current systems struggle to provide trustworthy explanations backed by concrete evidence. Our work introduces \model{}, a framework that tackles these limitations through three key innovations. We develop an online adaptation mechanism that continuously incorporates new user interactions through lightweight modules, avoiding the need to retrain large models. We create a unified representation that seamlessly combines collaborative signals with visual and audio features, handling cases where some modalities may be unavailable. Finally, we design an explanation system that grounds recommendations in specific collaborative patterns and item attributes, producing natural language rationales users can verify. Our approach maintains the efficiency of frozen base models while adding minimal computational overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities, such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S. National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B) remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.

Abstract: Contemporary generative recommendation systems face significant challenges in handling multimodal data, eliminating algorithmic biases, and providing transparent decision-making processes. This paper introduces an enhanced generative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through five key innovations: multimodal fusion architecture, retrieval-augmented generation mechanisms, causal inference-based debiasing, explainable recommendation generation, and real-time adaptive learning capabilities. Our framework leverages advanced large language models as the backbone while incorporating specialized modules for cross-modal understanding, contextual knowledge integration, bias mitigation, explanation synthesis, and continuous model adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (MovieLens-25M, Amazon-Electronics, Yelp-2023) demonstrate consistent improvements in recommendation accuracy, fairness, and diversity compared to existing approaches. The proposed framework achieves up to 2.3% improvement in NDCG@10 and 1.4% enhancement in diversity metrics while maintaining computational efficiency through optimized inference strategies.

Abstract: In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as ``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying lengths. Evaluation tool will be open-sourced.

Abstract: Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling, yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types (rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data \textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets. Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \textit{alone} results in notably higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. "Good" ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data. Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than ~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on "model collapse" during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by "model collapse". Our work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional benefits, and offers practical guidance.

Abstract: The discourse on privacy risks in Large Language Models (LLMs) has disproportionately focused on verbatim memorization of training data, while a constellation of more immediate and scalable privacy threats remain underexplored. This position paper argues that the privacy landscape of LLM systems extends far beyond training data extraction, encompassing risks from data collection practices, inference-time context leakage, autonomous agent capabilities, and the democratization of surveillance through deep inference attacks. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of privacy risks across the LLM lifecycle -- from data collection through deployment -- and demonstrate through case studies how current privacy frameworks fail to address these multifaceted threats. Through a longitudinal analysis of 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers published at leading conferences over the past decade (2016--2025), we reveal that while memorization receives outsized attention in technical research, the most pressing privacy harms lie elsewhere, where current technical approaches offer little traction and viable paths forward remain unclear. We call for a fundamental shift in how the research community approaches LLM privacy, moving beyond the narrow focus of current technical solutions and embracing interdisciplinary approaches that address the sociotechnical nature of these emerging threats.

<title>Just Do It!? Computer-Use Agents Exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness</title>

Abstract: Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii) assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models, including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists, highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions. Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias (focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect (execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk and ensuring safe CUA deployment.

Abstract: Evaluation of potential AGI systems and methods is difficult due to the breadth of the engineering goal. We have no methods for perfect evaluation of the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks, that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for AGI evaluation.

<title>Sparse Query Attention (SQA): A Computationally Efficient Attention Mechanism with Query Heads Reduction</title>

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, underpinned by the Multi-Head Attention (MHA) mechanism, has become the de facto standard for state-of-the-art models in artificial intelligence. However, the quadratic computational complexity of MHA with respect to sequence length presents a significant barrier to scaling, particularly for applications involving long contexts. Prevailing solutions, such as Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA), have effectively addressed the memory bandwidth bottleneck that dominates autoregressive inference latency by sharing Key and Value projections. While highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation, which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing. This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path. Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads. This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models

<title>Plan Then Action:High-Level Planning Guidance Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL), attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge, we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and LLaMA3.2-3B. Experimental results demonstrate that PTA-GRPO consistently achieves stable and significant improvements across different models and tasks, validating its effectiveness and generalization.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) are increasingly used in applications where generated outputs must satisfy strict semantic or syntactic constraints. Existing approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g., program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample -- while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that approximate the LM's distribution.

<title>Do AI Models Perform Human-like Abstract Reasoning Across Modalities?</title>

Abstract: OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models' abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone. In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered intelligence.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is undergoing the paradigm shift from closed language models to interconnected agent systems capable of external perception and information integration. As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents (DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition, cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively. This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises 214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for further improvement. This study provides a robust foundation for capability assessment, architectural refinement, and paradigm advancement in DRA systems.

<title>StockBench: Can LLM Agents Trade Stocks Profitably In Real-world Markets?</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities as autonomous agents, showing promise in reasoning, tool use, and sequential decision-making. While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful trading strategies. We release StockBench as an open-source resource to support reproducibility and advance future research in this domain.

<title>The Reasoning Boundary Paradox: How Reinforcement Learning Constrains Language Models</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/mail-research/SELF-llm-interference.

Abstract: Promptagator demonstrated that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot prompts can be used as task-specific query generators for fine-tuning domain-specialized dense retrieval models. However, the original Promptagator approach relied on proprietary and large-scale LLMs which users may not have access to or may be prohibited from using with sensitive data. In this work, we study the impact of open-source LLMs at accessible scales ($\leq$14B parameters) as an alternative. Our results demonstrate that open-source LLMs as small as 3B parameters can serve as effective Promptagator-style query generators. We hope our work will inform practitioners with reliable alternatives for synthetic data generation and give insights to maximize fine-tuning results for domain-specific applications.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) is an emerging paradigm for improving the reasoning ability of large language models. However, standard on-policy training discards rollout experiences after a single update, leading to computational inefficiency and instability. While prior work on RL has highlighted the benefits of reusing past experience, the role of experience characteristics in shaping learning dynamics of large reasoning models remains underexplored. In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods fail. These results highlight principled experience management as a key ingredient for efficient and scalable RLVR.

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate strong generalization results to different operating systems on WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN provides a practical framework to achieve this.

<title>RLAD: Training LLMs to Discover Abstractions for Solving Reasoning Problems</title>

Abstract: Reasoning requires going beyond pattern matching or memorization of solutions to identify and implement "algorithmic procedures" that can be used to deduce answers to hard problems. Doing so requires realizing the most relevant primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them. While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in guiding meaningful exploration.

Abstract: Despite recent rapid progress in AI safety, current large language models remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks in multi-turn interaction settings, where attackers strategically adapt their prompts across conversation turns and pose a more critical yet realistic challenge. Existing approaches that discover safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success across multiple turns.

Abstract: Traditional neural network training typically follows fixed, predefined optimization recipes, lacking the flexibility to dynamically respond to instabilities or emerging training issues. In this paper, we introduce Interactive Training, an open-source framework that enables real-time, feedback-driven intervention during neural network training by human experts or automated AI agents. At its core, Interactive Training uses a control server to mediate communication between users or agents and the ongoing training process, allowing users to dynamically adjust optimizer hyperparameters, training data, and model checkpoints. Through three case studies, we demonstrate that Interactive Training achieves superior training stability, reduced sensitivity to initial hyperparameters, and improved adaptability to evolving user needs, paving the way toward a future training paradigm where AI agents autonomously monitor training logs, proactively resolve instabilities, and optimize training dynamics.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are overwhelmingly more and more integrated into various applications, ensuring they generate safe responses is a pressing need. Previous studies on alignment have largely focused on general instruction-following but have often overlooked the distinct properties of safety alignment, such as the brittleness of safety mechanisms. To bridge the gap, we propose the Superficial Safety Alignment Hypothesis (SSAH), which posits that safety alignment teaches an otherwise unsafe model to choose the correct reasoning direction - fulfill or refuse users' requests - interpreted as an implicit binary classification task. Through SSAH, we hypothesize that only a few essential components can establish safety guardrails in LLMs. We successfully identify four types of attribute-critical components: Safety Critical Unit (SCU), Utility Critical Unit (UCU), Complex Unit (CU), and Redundant Unit (RU). Our findings show that freezing certain safety-critical components during fine-tuning allows the model to retain its safety attributes while adapting to new tasks. Similarly, we show that leveraging redundant units in the pre-trained model as an "alignment budget" can effectively minimize the alignment tax while achieving the alignment goal. All considered, this paper concludes that the atomic functional unit for safety in LLMs is at the neuron level and underscores that safety alignment should not be complicated.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate multilingual abilities, yet they are English-centric due to dominance of English in training corpora. The limited resource for low-resource languages remains a crucial challenge. Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate between languages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuances that can be otherwise lost in translation and elicits language-specific knowledge in human communications. In light of this, we investigate whether code-switching can activate, or identify and leverage knowledge for reasoning when LLMs solve low-resource language tasks. To facilitate the research, we first present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset. We provide comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs by subdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledge leveraging. Our results demonstrate that compared to English text, CS can faithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs especially on language-specific domains, suggesting the potential of code-switching on low-resource language tasks.

Abstract: Self-consistency (SC) improves the performance of large language models (LLMs) across various tasks and domains that involve short content. However, does this support its effectiveness for long-context problems?
  We challenge the assumption that SC's benefits generalize to long-context settings, where LLMs often struggle with position bias, the systematic over-reliance on specific context regions-which hinders their ability to utilize information effectively from all parts of their context. Through comprehensive experimentation with varying state-of-the-art models, tasks, and SC formulations, we find that SC not only fails to improve but actively degrades performance on long-context tasks. This degradation is driven by persistent position bias, which worsens with longer context lengths and smaller model sizes but remains invariant to prompt format or task type. Unlike short-context tasks, where SC diversifies reasoning paths, long-context SC amplifies positional errors. These comprehensive results provide valuable insight into the limitations of current LLMs in long-context understanding and highlight the need for more sophisticated approaches.

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) aim to provide personalized recommendations by capturing user preferences through interactive dialogues. Explainability in CRSs is crucial as it enables users to understand the reasoning behind recommendations, increasing system transparency and trustworthiness. However, current CRSs often leverage knowledge graphs (KGs) or language models to extract and represent user preferences as latent vectors, which limits their explainability. Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities that can bridge this gap by generating human-understandable preference summaries. However, effectively reasoning over user preferences in CRSs remains challenging as LLMs pre-trained on large-scale corpora may not be well-suited for analyzing user preferences. While KGs provide rich domain knowledge, integrating them with LLMs encounters a significant modality gap between structured KG information and unstructured conversations. In this paper, we propose COMPASS, a plug-and-play framework that synergizes LLMs and KGs to reason over user preferences, enhancing the performance and explainability of existing CRSs. COMPASS employs a two-stage training approach: first, it bridges the gap between the structured KG and natural language through novel graph entity captioning pre-training. Next, COMPASS optimizes user preference reasoning via knowledge-aware instruction fine-tuning, where the LLM learns to reason and summarize user preferences from dialogue histories and KG-augmented context. This enables COMPASS to perform knowledge-aware reasoning and generate interpretable user preferences that can seamlessly integrate with existing CRS models for improving recommendation performance and explainability. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of COMPASS in improving various CRS models.

Abstract: Understanding the emotions in a dialogue usually requires external knowledge to accurately understand the contents. As the LLMs become more and more powerful, we do not want to settle on the limited ability of the pre-trained language model. However, the LLMs either can only process text modality or are too expensive to process the multimedia information. We aim to utilize both the power of LLMs and the supplementary features from the multimedia modalities. In this paper, we present a framework, Lantern, that can improve the performance of a certain vanilla model by prompting large language models with receptive-field-aware attention weighting. This framework trained a multi-task vanilla model to produce probabilities of emotion classes and dimension scores. These predictions are fed into the LLMs as references to adjust the predicted probabilities of each emotion class with its external knowledge and contextual understanding. We slice the dialogue into different receptive fields, and each sample is included in exactly t receptive fields. Finally, the predictions of LLMs are merged with a receptive-field-aware attention-driven weighting module. In the experiments, vanilla models CORECT and SDT are deployed in Lantern with GPT-4 or Llama-3.1-405B. The experiments in IEMOCAP with 4-way and 6-way settings demonstrated that the Lantern can significantly improve the performance of current vanilla models by up to 1.23% and 1.80%.

Abstract: Low-rank adapters have become standard for efficiently fine-tuning large language models, but they often fall short of achieving the performance of full fine-tuning. We propose a method, LoRA Silver Bullet or LoRA-SB, that approximates full fine-tuning within low-rank subspaces using a carefully designed initialization strategy. We theoretically demonstrate that the architecture of LoRA-XS, which inserts a learnable r x r matrix between B and A while keeping other matrices fixed, provides the precise conditions needed for this approximation. We leverage its constrained update space to achieve optimal scaling for high-rank gradient updates while removing the need for scaling factor tuning. We prove that our initialization offers an optimal low-rank approximation of the initial gradient and preserves update directions throughout training. Extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and language understanding tasks demonstrate that our approach exceeds the performance of LoRA (and baselines) while using 27-90 times fewer learnable parameters, and comprehensively outperforms LoRA-XS. Our findings establish that it is possible to simulate full fine-tuning in low-rank subspaces, and achieve significant parameter efficiency gains without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Users of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) may write letter-by-letter via an interface that uses a character language model. However, most state-of-the-art large pretrained language models predict subword tokens of variable length. We investigate how to practically use such models to make accurate and efficient character predictions. Our algorithm for producing character predictions from a subword large language model (LLM) provides more accurate predictions than using a classification layer, a byte-level LLM, or an n-gram model. Additionally, we investigate a domain adaptation procedure based on a large dataset of sentences we curated based on scoring how useful each sentence might be for spoken or written AAC communication. We find our procedure further improves model performance on simple, conversational text.

Abstract: Distinguishing in- and out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is crucial for reliable deployment of classification systems. However, OOD data is typically unavailable or difficult to collect, posing a significant challenge for accurate OOD detection. In this work, we present a method that harnesses the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create high-quality synthetic OOD proxies, eliminating the dependency on any external OOD data source. We study the efficacy of our method on classical text classification tasks such as toxicity detection and sentiment classification as well as classification tasks arising in LLM development and deployment, such as training a reward model for RLHF and detecting misaligned generations. Extensive experiments on nine InD-OOD dataset pairs and various model sizes show that our approach dramatically lowers false positive rates (achieving a perfect zero in some cases) while maintaining high accuracy on in-distribution tasks, outperforming baseline methods by a significant margin.

However, despite their ubiquitous application, challenges persist in interpreting embeddings and explaining similarities between them. In this work, we provide a structured overview of methods specializing in inherently interpretable text embeddings and text similarity explanation, an underexplored research area. We characterize the main ideas, approaches, and trade-offs. We compare means of evaluation, discuss overarching lessons learned and finally identify opportunities and open challenges for future research.

<title>When Disagreements Elicit Robustness: Investigating Self-Repair Capabilities under LLM Multi-Agent Disagreements</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have upgraded them from sophisticated text generators to autonomous agents capable of cooperation and tool use in multi-agent systems (MAS). However, it remains unclear how disagreements shape collective decision-making. In this paper, we revisit the role of disagreement and argue that general, partially overlapping disagreements prevent premature consensus and expand the explored solution space, while disagreements on task-critical steps can derail collaboration depending on the topology of solution paths. We investigate two collaborative settings with distinct path structures: collaborative reasoning (CounterFact, MQuAKE-cf), which typically follows a single evidential chain, whereas collaborative programming (HumanEval, GAIA) often adopts multiple valid implementations. Disagreements are instantiated as general heterogeneity among agents and as task-critical counterfactual knowledge edits injected into context or parameters. Experiments reveal that general disagreements consistently improve success by encouraging complementary exploration. By contrast, task-critical disagreements substantially reduce success on single-path reasoning, yet have a limited impact on programming, where agents can choose alternative solutions. Trace analyses show that MAS frequently bypasses the edited facts in programming but rarely does so in reasoning, revealing an emergent self-repair capability that depends on solution-path rather than scale alone.

<title>FANS -- Formal Answer Selection for Natural Language Math Reasoning Using Lean4</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have displayed astonishing abilities in various tasks, especially in text generation, classification, question answering, etc. However, the reasoning ability of LLMs still faces many debates. The inherent ambiguity of Natural Language (NL) limits LLMs' ability to perform verifiable reasoning, making its answers lack coherence and trustworthy support. To tackle the above problems, we propose a novel framework named FANS: Formal ANswer Selection for Natural Language Math Reasoning Using Lean4. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework that utilizes Lean4 to enhance LLMs' NL math reasoning ability. In particular, given an NL math question and LLM-generated answers, FANS first translates it into Lean4 theorem statements. Then it tries to prove it using a Lean4 prover and verify it by Lean4. Finally, it uses the FL result to assist in answer selection. It enhances LLMs' NL math ability in providing a computer-verifiable solution for its correct answer and proposes an alternative method for answer selection beyond the reward model. Extensive experiments indicate the effectiveness of our framework. It can improve the accuracy rate of reward model enhanced LLMs in the MATH-500 dataset by at most 1.91% and AMC-23 by at most 8.33% on strong reward-model baselines. In some particular fields like number theory that Lean4 experts in, we can even select all correct solutions. The qualitative analysis also shows our framework can make NL results formally backed by Lean4 proofs. As a pioneering work in the corresponding field, we will open-source all our models and datasets to further boost the development of the field.

Abstract: Probabilistic reasoning is a key aspect of both human and artificial intelligence that allows for handling uncertainty and ambiguity in decision-making. In this paper, we introduce a new numerical reasoning task under uncertainty for large language models, focusing on estimating the privacy risk of user-generated documents containing privacy-sensitive information. We propose BRANCH, a new LLM methodology that estimates the k-privacy value of a text-the size of the population matching the given information. BRANCH factorizes a joint probability distribution of personal information as random variables. The probability of each factor in a population is estimated separately using a Bayesian network and combined to compute the final k-value. Our experiments show that this method successfully estimates the k-value 73% of the time, a 13% increase compared to o3-mini with chain-of-thought reasoning. We also find that LLM uncertainty is a good indicator for accuracy, as high-variance predictions are 37.47% less accurate on average.

Abstract: Large language models have made tremendous progress in recent years, but low-resource languages, like Tibetan, remain significantly underrepresented in their evaluation. Despite Tibetan being spoken by over seven million people, it has largely been neglected in the development and assessment of large language models. To address this gap, we present a \textbf{T}ibetan \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{U}nderstanding \textbf{E}valuation Benchmark, \textbf{TLUE}, the first large-scale benchmark for measuring the proficiency of LLMs in the Tibetan language. \textbf{TLUE} comprises two major components: a comprehensive multi-task understanding benchmark spanning 5 domains and 67 subdomains, and a safety benchmark encompassing 7 subdomains. Then, we evaluate a diverse set of state-of-the-art large language models. Experimental results demonstrate that most large language models perform below the random baseline, highlighting the considerable challenges they face in Tibetan language processing. \textbf{TLUE} provides a crucial foundation for advancing future research in Tibetan language understanding and highlights the importance of promoting greater inclusivity in the development of large language models.

<title>Boundless Byte Pair Encoding: Breaking the Pre-tokenization Barrier</title>

Abstract: Pre-tokenization, the initial step in many modern tokenization pipelines, segments text into smaller units called pretokens, typically splitting on whitespace and punctuation. While this process encourages having full, individual words as tokens, it introduces a fundamental limitation in most tokenization algorithms such as Byte Pair Encoding (BPE). Specifically, pre-tokenization causes the distribution of tokens in a corpus to heavily skew towards common, full-length words. This skewed distribution limits the benefits of expanding to larger vocabularies, since the additional tokens appear with progressively lower counts. To overcome this barrier, we propose BoundlessBPE, a modified BPE algorithm that relaxes the pretoken boundary constraint. Our approach selectively merges two complete pretokens into a larger unit we term a superword. Superwords are not necessarily semantically cohesive. For example, the pretokens " of" and " the" might be combined to form the superword " of the". This merging strategy results in a substantially more uniform distribution of tokens across a corpus than standard BPE, and compresses text more effectively, with up to a 15% increase in bytes per token.

Abstract: Effective conversational agents like large language models (LLMs) must personalize their interactions to adapt to user preferences, personalities, and attributes across diverse domains like education and healthcare. Current methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often prioritize helpfulness and safety but fall short in fostering truly empathetic, adaptive, and personalized dialogues. Existing personalization approaches typically rely on extensive user history, limiting their effectiveness for new or context-limited users. To address these limitations, we propose leveraging a user model to incorporate a curiosity-based intrinsic reward into multi-turn RLHF. This novel reward mechanism encourages the LLM agent to actively infer user traits by optimizing conversations to improve its user model's accuracy. Consequently, the agent delivers more personalized interactions by learning more about the user. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness in two distinct domains: significantly improving personalization performance in a conversational recommendation task, and personalizing conversations for different learning styles in an educational setting. We show improved generalization capabilities compared to traditional multi-turn RLHF, all while maintaining conversation quality. Our method offers a promising solution for creating more personalized, adaptive, and engaging conversational agents.

Abstract: With recent advancements in large language models, web agents have been greatly improved. However, dealing with complex and dynamic web environments requires more advanced planning and search abilities. Previous studies usually adopt a greedy one-way search strategy, which may struggle to recover from erroneous states. In this work, we enhance web agents with an explicit rollback mechanism, enabling the agent to revert back to a previous state in its navigation trajectory. This mechanism gives the model the flexibility to directly control the search process, leading to an effective and efficient web navigation method. We conduct experiments on two live web navigation benchmarks with zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a major public safety and socio-economic issue in developing countries like Bangladesh. Existing accident data collection is largely manual, fragmented, and unreliable, resulting in underreporting and inconsistent records. This research proposes a fully automated system using Large Language Models (LLMs) and web scraping techniques to address these challenges. The pipeline consists of four components: automated web scraping code generation, news collection from online sources, accident news classification with structured data extraction, and duplicate removal. The system uses the multimodal generative LLM Gemini-2.0-Flash for seamless automation. The code generation module classifies webpages into pagination, dynamic, or infinite scrolling categories and generates suitable Python scripts for scraping. LLMs also classify and extract key accident information such as date, time, location, fatalities, injuries, road type, vehicle types, and pedestrian involvement. A deduplication algorithm ensures data integrity by removing duplicate reports. The system scraped 14 major Bangladeshi news sites over 111 days (Oct 1, 2024 - Jan 20, 2025), processing over 15,000 news articles and identifying 705 unique accidents. The code generation module achieved 91.3% calibration and 80% validation accuracy. Chittagong reported the highest number of accidents (80), fatalities (70), and injuries (115), followed by Dhaka, Faridpur, Gazipur, and Cox's Bazar. Peak accident times were morning (8-9 AM), noon (12-1 PM), and evening (6-7 PM). A public repository was also developed with usage instructions. This study demonstrates the viability of an LLM-powered, scalable system for accurate, low-effort accident data collection, providing a foundation for data-driven road safety policymaking in Bangladesh.

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their ability to process structured symbolic knowledge remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a taxonomy of ontological capabilities and introduce OntoURL, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate LLMs' capabilities in handling ontologies -- formal and symbolic representations of domain knowledge. Based on the proposed taxonomy, OntoURL systematically assesses three dimensions: understanding, reasoning, and learning through 15 distinct tasks comprising 57,303 questions derived from 40 ontologies across 8 domains. Experiments with 20 open-source LLMs reveal significant performance differences across models, tasks, and domains, with current LLMs showing capabilities in understanding ontological knowledge but weaknesses in reasoning and learning tasks. Further experiments with few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting illustrate how different prompting strategies affect model performance. Additionally, a human evaluation reveals that LLMs outperform humans in understanding and reasoning tasks but fall short in most learning tasks. These findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs in processing symbolic knowledge and establish OntoURL as a critical benchmark for advancing the integration of LLMs with formal knowledge representations.

Abstract: Long-form legal reasoning remains a key challenge for large language models (LLMs) in spite of recent advances in test-time scaling. To address this, we introduce \textsc{LEXam}, a novel benchmark derived from 340 law exams spanning 116 law school courses across a range of subjects and degree levels. The dataset comprises 4,886 law exam questions in English and German, including 2,841 long-form, open-ended questions and 2,045 multiple-choice questions. Besides reference answers, the open questions are also accompanied by explicit guidance outlining the expected legal reasoning approach such as issue spotting, rule recall, or rule application. Our evaluation on both open-ended and multiple-choice questions present significant challenges for current LLMs; in particular, they notably struggle with open questions that require structured, multi-step legal reasoning. Moreover, our results underscore the effectiveness of the dataset in differentiating between models with varying capabilities. Deploying an ensemble LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm with rigorous human expert validation, we demonstrate how model-generated reasoning steps can be evaluated consistently and accurately, closely aligning with human expert assessments. Our evaluation setup provides a scalable method to assess legal reasoning quality beyond simple accuracy metrics. We have open-sourced our code on \href{https://github.com/LEXam-Benchmark/LEXam}{GitHub} and released our data on \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/LEXam-Benchmark/LEXam}{Hugging Face}.

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of tasks, but adapting them efficiently to new domains remains a key challenge. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by introducing lightweight, trainable modules while keeping most pre-trained weights fixed. The prevailing approach, LoRA, models updates using a low-rank decomposition, but its expressivity is inherently constrained by the rank. Recent methods like HiRA aim to increase expressivity by incorporating a Hadamard product with the frozen weights, but still rely on the structure of the pre-trained model. We introduce ABBA, a new PEFT architecture that reparameterizes the update as a Hadamard product of two independently learnable low-rank matrices. In contrast to prior work, ABBA fully decouples the update from the pre-trained weights, enabling both components to be optimized freely. This leads to significantly higher expressivity under the same parameter budget, a property we validate through matrix reconstruction experiments. Empirically, ABBA achieves state-of-the-art results on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing PEFT methods by a significant margin across multiple models. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/CERT-Lab/abba.

Abstract: Precise recognition, editing, and generation of molecules are essential prerequisites for both chemists and AI systems tackling various chemical tasks. We present MolLangBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate fundamental molecule-language interface tasks: language-prompted molecular structure recognition, editing, and generation. To ensure high-quality, unambiguous, and deterministic outputs, we construct the recognition tasks using automated cheminformatics tools, and curate editing and generation tasks through rigorous expert annotation and validation. MolLangBench supports the evaluation of models that interface language with different molecular representations, including linear strings, molecular images, and molecular graphs. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models reveal significant limitations: the strongest model (GPT-5) achieves $86.2\%$ and $85.5\%$ accuracy on recognition and editing tasks, which are intuitively simple for humans, and performs even worse on the generation task, reaching only $43.0\%$ accuracy. These results highlight the shortcomings of current AI systems in handling even preliminary molecular recognition and manipulation tasks. We hope MolLangBench will catalyze further research toward more effective and reliable AI systems for chemical applications.

Abstract: We present BiasLab, a dataset of 300 political news articles annotated for perceived ideological bias. These articles were selected from a curated 900-document pool covering diverse political events and source biases. Each article is labeled by crowdworkers along two independent scales, assessing sentiment toward the Democratic and Republican parties, and enriched with rationale indicators. The annotation pipeline incorporates targeted worker qualification and was refined through pilot-phase analysis. We quantify inter-annotator agreement, analyze misalignment with source-level outlet bias, and organize the resulting labels into interpretable subsets. Additionally, we simulate annotation using schema-constrained GPT-4o, enabling direct comparison to human labels and revealing mirrored asymmetries, especially in misclassifying subtly right-leaning content. We define two modeling tasks: perception drift prediction and rationale type classification, and report baseline performance to illustrate the challenge of explainable bias detection. BiasLab's rich rationale annotations provide actionable interpretations that facilitate explainable modeling of political bias, supporting the development of transparent, socially aware NLP systems. We release the dataset, annotation schema, and modeling code to encourage research on human-in-the-loop interpretability and the evaluation of explanation effectiveness in real-world settings.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning typically involves considering alternatives to actual events. While often applied to understand past events, a distinct form-forward counterfactual reasoning-focuses on anticipating plausible future developments. This type of reasoning is invaluable in dynamic financial markets, where anticipating market developments can powerfully unveil potential risks and opportunities for stakeholders, guiding their decision-making. However, performing this at scale is challenging due to the cognitive demands involved, underscoring the need for automated solutions. LLMs offer promise, but remain unexplored for this application. To address this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark, FIN-FORCE-FINancial FORward Counterfactual Evaluation. By curating financial news headlines and providing structured evaluation, FIN-FORCE supports LLM based forward counterfactual generation. This paves the way for scalable and automated solutions for exploring and anticipating future market developments, thereby providing structured insights for decision-making. Through experiments on FIN-FORCE, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and counterfactual generation methods, analyzing their limitations and proposing insights for future research. We release the benchmark, supplementary data and all experimental codes at the following link: https://github.com/keanepotato/fin_force

Abstract: With over 2,000 languages and potentially millions of speakers, Africa represents one of the richest linguistic regions in the world. Yet, this diversity is scarcely reflected in state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) systems and large language models (LLMs), which predominantly support a narrow set of high-resource languages. This exclusion not only limits the reach and utility of modern NLP technologies but also risks widening the digital divide across linguistic communities. Nevertheless, NLP research on African languages is active and growing. In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in this area, driven by several factors-including the creation of multilingual language resources, the rise of community-led initiatives, and increased support through funding programs. In this survey, we analyze 884 research papers on NLP for African languages published over the past five years, offering a comprehensive overview of recent progress across core tasks. We identify key trends shaping the field and conclude by outlining promising directions to foster more inclusive and sustainable NLP research for African languages.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) with thinking traces have shown strong performance on English reasoning tasks. However, their ability to think in other languages is less studied. This capability is as important as answer accuracy for real world applications because users may find the reasoning trace useful for oversight only when it is expressed in their own language. We comprehensively evaluate two leading families of LRMs on our XReasoning benchmark and find that even the most advanced models often revert to English or produce fragmented reasoning in other languages, revealing a substantial gap in multilingual reasoning. Prompt based interventions that force models to reason in the users language improve readability and oversight but reduce answer accuracy, exposing an important trade off. We further show that targeted post training on just 100 examples mitigates this mismatch, though some accuracy loss remains. Our results highlight the limited multilingual reasoning capabilities of current LRMs and outline directions for future work.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) systems rely on high-quality benchmarks to evaluate complex multi-hop reasoning. However, despite their widespread use, popular datasets such as WebQSP and CWQ suffer from critical quality issues, including inaccurate or incomplete ground-truth annotations, poorly constructed questions that are ambiguous, trivial, or unanswerable, and outdated or inconsistent knowledge. Through a manual audit of 16 popular KGQA datasets, including WebQSP and CWQ, we find that the average factual correctness rate is only 57 %. To address these issues, we introduce KGQAGen, an LLM-in-the-loop framework that systematically resolves these pitfalls. KGQAGen combines structured knowledge grounding, LLM-guided generation, and symbolic verification to produce challenging and verifiable QA instances. Using KGQAGen, we construct KGQAGen-10k, a ten-thousand scale benchmark grounded in Wikidata, and evaluate a diverse set of KG-RAG models. Experimental results demonstrate that even state-of-the-art systems struggle on this benchmark, highlighting its ability to expose limitations of existing models. Our findings advocate for more rigorous benchmark construction and position KGQAGen as a scalable framework for advancing KGQA evaluation.

Abstract: As people increasingly use AI systems in work and daily life, feedback mechanisms that help them use AI responsibly are urgently needed, particularly in settings where users are not equipped to assess the quality of AI predictions. We study a realistic Machine Translation (MT) scenario where monolingual users decide whether to share an MT output, first without and then with quality feedback. We compare four types of quality feedback: explicit feedback that directly give users an assessment of translation quality using (1) error highlights and (2) LLM explanations, and implicit feedback that helps users compare MT inputs and outputs through (3) backtranslation and (4) question-answer (QA) tables. We find that all feedback types, except error highlights, significantly improve both decision accuracy and appropriate reliance. Notably, implicit feedback, especially QA tables, yields significantly greater gains than explicit feedback in terms of decision accuracy, appropriate reliance, and user perceptions, receiving the highest ratings for helpfulness and trust, and the lowest for mental burden.

Abstract: A critical component in the trustworthiness of LLMs is reliable uncertainty communication, yet LLMs often use assertive language when conveying false claims, leading to over-reliance and eroded trust. We present the first systematic study of $\textit{faithful confidence calibration}$ of LLMs, benchmarking models' ability to use linguistic expressions of uncertainty that $\textit{faithfully reflect}$ their intrinsic uncertainty, across a comprehensive array of models, datasets, and prompting strategies. Our results demonstrate that LLMs largely fail at this task, and that existing interventions are insufficient: standard prompt approaches provide only marginal gains, and existing, factuality-based calibration techniques can even harm faithful calibration. To address this critical gap, we introduce MetaFaith, a novel prompt-based calibration approach inspired by human metacognition. We show that MetaFaith robustly improves faithful calibration across diverse models and task domains, enabling up to 61% improvement in faithfulness and achieving an 83% win rate over original generations as judged by humans.

<title>Do LLMs Really Forget? Evaluating Unlearning with Knowledge Correlation and Confidence Awareness</title>

Abstract: Machine unlearning techniques aim to mitigate unintended memorization in large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches predominantly focus on the explicit removal of isolated facts, often overlooking latent inferential dependencies and the non-deterministic nature of knowledge within LLMs. Consequently, facts presumed forgotten may persist implicitly through correlated information. To address these challenges, we propose a knowledge unlearning evaluation framework that more accurately captures the implicit structure of real-world knowledge by representing relevant factual contexts as knowledge graphs with associated confidence scores. We further develop an inference-based evaluation protocol leveraging powerful LLMs as judges; these judges reason over the extracted knowledge subgraph to determine unlearning success. Our LLM judges utilize carefully designed prompts and are calibrated against human evaluations to ensure their trustworthiness and stability. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark demonstrate that our framework provides a more realistic and rigorous assessment of unlearning performance. Moreover, our findings reveal that current evaluation strategies tend to overestimate unlearning effectiveness. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Graph-COM/Knowledge_Unlearning.git.

Abstract: While slow-thinking large language models (LLMs) exhibit reflection-like reasoning, commonly referred to as the "aha moment:, their ability to generate informative critiques and refine prior solutions remains limited. In this paper, we introduce Double-Checker, a principled framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of slow-thinking LLMs by fostering explicit self-critique and iterative refinement of their previous solutions. By fine-tuning on our curated 1,730 self-critical instances, Double-Checker empowers long-CoT LLMs to iteratively critique and refine their outputs during inference until they evaluate their solutions as correct under self-generated critiques. We validate the efficacy of Double-Checker across a comprehensive suite of reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that iterative self-critique significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of long-CoT LLMs. Notably, our Double-Checker increases the pass@1 performance on challenging AIME benchmarks from 4.4% to 18.2% compared to the original long-CoT LLMs. These results highlight a promising direction for developing more trustworthy and effective LLMs capable of structured self-critique.

Abstract: Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have underscored the crucial role of high-quality datasets in building large language models (LLMs). However, while extensive resources and analyses exist for English, the landscape for East Asian languages - particularly Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) - remains fragmented and underexplored, despite these languages together serving over 1.6 billion speakers. To address this gap, we investigate the HuggingFace ecosystem from a cross-linguistic perspective, focusing on how cultural norms, research environments, and institutional practices shape dataset availability and quality. Drawing on more than 3,300 datasets, we employ quantitative and qualitative methods to examine how these factors drive distinct creation and curation patterns across Chinese, Japanese, and Korean NLP communities. Our findings highlight the large-scale and often institution-driven nature of Chinese datasets, grassroots community-led development in Korean NLP, and an entertainment- and subculture-focused emphasis on Japanese collections. By uncovering these patterns, we reveal practical strategies for enhancing dataset documentation, licensing clarity, and cross-lingual resource sharing - ultimately guiding more effective and culturally attuned LLM development in East Asia. We conclude by discussing best practices for future dataset curation and collaboration, aiming to strengthen resource development across all three languages.

Abstract: Large language models readily memorize arbitrary training instances, such as label noise, yet they perform strikingly well on reasoning tasks. In this work, we investigate how language models memorize label noise, and why such memorization in many cases does not heavily affect generalizable reasoning capabilities. Using two controllable synthetic reasoning datasets with noisy labels, four-digit addition (FDA) and two-hop relational reasoning (THR), we discover a reliance of memorization on generalizable reasoning mechanisms: models continue to compute intermediate reasoning outputs even when retrieving memorized noisy labels, and intervening reasoning adversely affects memorization. We further show that memorization operates through distributed encoding, i.e., aggregating various inputs and intermediate results, rather than building a look-up mechanism from inputs to noisy labels. Moreover, our FDA case study reveals memorization occurs via outlier heuristics, where existing neuron activation patterns are slightly shifted to fit noisy labels. Together, our findings suggest that memorization of label noise in language models builds on, rather than overrides, the underlying reasoning mechanisms, shedding lights on the intriguing phenomenon of benign memorization.

<title>Flexible Feature Distillation for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has become a cornerstone for compressing large language models (LLMs). However, existing LLM-KD methods have primarily focused on logit-based approaches, which achieve good performance but overlook the rich internal representations of LLMs. Feature-level KD could leverage this structure to provide complementary benefits, yet it remains underexplored because current feature-KD approaches typically assume identical teacher-student hidden sizes, a restrictive and unrealistic assumption. A common workaround is to train a linear projector to align their feature spaces; however, this introduces additional parameters, distorts teacher embeddings, and often degrades downstream performance, especially in generative tasks. We propose Flex-KD, a parameter-free framework for task-driven feature distillation for LLMs. Instead of projecting the entire teacher representation, Flex-KD uses gradient-based scores to identify the most task-relevant dimensions of the teacher's hidden states and distills only this subspace into the student. This ensures that the student's limited capacity is allocated to informative components, while avoiding projector-induced distortion and extra parameters. Flex-KD integrates seamlessly with existing KD pipelines and supports differing teacher-student hidden sizes. Extensive experiments across both classification and generative tasks, i.e., instruction-following and summarization, show that Flex-KD consistently boosts student performance, achieving up to a 3.75 percent performance gain over the linear projection baseline.

Abstract: When evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in question answering domains, it is common to ask the model to choose among a fixed set of choices (so-called multiple-choice question-answering, or MCQA). Although downstream tasks of interest typically do not provide systems with explicit options among which to choose, this approach is nevertheless widely used because it makes automatic grading straightforward and has tended to produce challenging benchmarks that correlate sufficiently well with downstream performance. This paper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for state-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of 15 different question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K) and 27 different LLMs (including small models such as Qwen-2.5 7B, mid-sized models such as Llama-3.3 70B, and large state-of-the-art models such as OpenAI's o3). For each model--benchmark pair, we considered 5 ways of presenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple choices were offered to the model at all; whether "none of the above" sometimes replaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform chain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented. MCQA remained a good proxy for the downstream performance of models as long as they were allowed to perform chain-of-thought reasoning only \emph{before} being presented with the options among which they had to select. On the other hand, large models that were able to perform reasoning \emph{after} being given a set of options tended to significantly outperform their free-text performance due to exploiting the information in the options. We identify and quantify the signals models are using when answering MCQA questions, and offer practical guidelines when analyzing results from MCQA that better reflect LLMs' genuine reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: News recommendation systems play a critical role in alleviating information overload by delivering personalized content. A key challenge lies in jointly modeling multi-view representations of news articles and capturing the dynamic, dual-scale nature of user interests-encompassing both short- and long-term preferences. Prior methods often rely on single-view features or insufficiently model user behavior across time. In this work, we introduce Co-NAML-LSTUR, a hybrid news recommendation framework that integrates NAML for attentive multi-view news encoding and LSTUR for hierarchical user modeling, designed for training on limited data resources. Our approach leverages BERT-based embeddings to enhance semantic representation. We evaluate Co-NAML-LSTUR on two widely used benchmarks, MIND-small and MIND-large. Results show that our model significantly outperforms strong baselines, achieving improvements over NRMS by 1.55% in AUC and 1.15% in MRR, and over NAML by 2.45% in AUC and 1.71% in MRR. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our efficiency-focused hybrid model, which combines multi-view news modeling with dual-scale user representations for practical, resource-limited resources rather than a claim to absolute state-of-the-art (SOTA). The implementation of our model is publicly available at https://github.com/MinhNguyenDS/Co-NAML-LSTUR

Abstract: The critical lack of structured terminological data for South Africa's official languages hampers progress in multilingual NLP, despite the existence of numerous government and academic terminology lists. These valuable assets remain fragmented and locked in non-machine-readable formats, rendering them unusable for computational research and development. \emph{Mafoko} addresses this challenge by systematically aggregating, cleaning, and standardising these scattered resources into open, interoperable datasets. We introduce the foundational \emph{Mafoko} dataset, released under the equitable, Africa-centered NOODL framework. To demonstrate its immediate utility, we integrate the terminology into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Experiments show substantial improvements in the accuracy and domain-specific consistency of English-to-Tshivenda machine translation for large language models. \emph{Mafoko} provides a scalable foundation for developing robust and equitable NLP technologies, ensuring South Africa's rich linguistic diversity is represented in the digital age.

Abstract: How similar are model outputs across languages? In this work, we study this question using a recently proposed model similarity metric $\kappa_p$ applied to 20 languages and 47 subjects in GlobalMMLU. Our analysis reveals that a model's responses become increasingly consistent across languages as its size and capability grow. Interestingly, models exhibit greater cross-lingual consistency within themselves than agreement with other models prompted in the same language. These results highlight not only the value of $\kappa_p$ as a practical tool for evaluating multilingual reliability, but also its potential to guide the development of more consistent multilingual systems.

Abstract: Radiology reports contain rich clinical information that can be used to train imaging models without relying on costly manual annotation. However, existing approaches face critical limitations: rule-based methods struggle with linguistic variability, supervised models require large annotated datasets, and recent LLM-based systems depend on closed-source or resource-intensive models that are unsuitable for clinical use. Moreover, current solutions are largely restricted to English and single-modality, single-taxonomy datasets. We introduce MOSAIC, a multilingual, taxonomy-agnostic, and computationally efficient approach for radiological report classification. Built on a compact open-access language model (MedGemma-4B), MOSAIC supports both zero-/few-shot prompting and lightweight fine-tuning, enabling deployment on consumer-grade GPUs. We evaluate MOSAIC across seven datasets in English, Spanish, French, and Danish, spanning multiple imaging modalities and label taxonomies. The model achieves a mean macro F1 score of 88 across five chest X-ray datasets, approaching or exceeding expert-level performance, while requiring only 24 GB of GPU memory. With data augmentation, as few as 80 annotated samples are sufficient to reach a weighted F1 score of 82 on Danish reports, compared to 86 with the full 1600-sample training set. MOSAIC offers a practical alternative to large or proprietary LLMs in clinical settings. Code and models are open-source. We invite the community to evaluate and extend MOSAIC on new languages, taxonomies, and modalities.

<title>Investigating ReLoRA: Effects on the Learning Dynamics of Small Language Models</title>

Abstract: Parameter-efficient methods like LoRA have revolutionised large language model (LLM) fine-tuning. ReLoRA extends this idea to pretraining by repeatedly merging and reinitialising low-rank adapters, increasing cumulative rank while keeping updates cheap. This aligns well with observations that high-capacity models learn through locally low-rank trajectories that expand over time. By contrast, recent work suggests that small language models (SLMs) exhibit rank deficiencies and under-utilise their available dimensionality. This raises a natural question: can ReLoRA's rank-expanding update rule \textit{steer} SLMs toward healthier learning dynamics, mitigating rank bottlenecks in a capacity-constrained regime? We argue SLMs are an ideal testbed: they train quickly, enable controlled ablations, and make rank phenomena more measurable. We present the first systematic study of ReLoRA in SLMs (11M-66M parameters), evaluating both performance and learning dynamics. Across loss, Paloma perplexity, and BLiMP, we find that ReLoRA underperforms full-rank training, with gaps widening at larger scales. Analysis of proportional effective rank and condition numbers shows that ReLoRA amplifies existing rank deficiencies and induces ill-conditioned updates early in training. Our results suggest that while ReLoRA's merge-and-restart strategy can expand ranks in larger models, it does not straightforwardly translate to capacity-limited SLMs, motivating adaptive-rank or hybrid-rank approaches for low-compute pretraining.

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) systems enable language models to answer knowledge-intensive queries with citation-supported responses across languages. While such systems have been proposed, an open questions is whether the mixture of different document languages impacts generation and citation in unintended ways. To investigate, we introduce a controlled methodology using model internals to measure language preference while holding other factors such as document relevance constant. Across eight languages and six open-weight models, we find that models preferentially cite English sources when queries are in English, with this bias amplified for lower-resource languages and for documents positioned mid-context. Crucially, we find that models sometimes trade-off document relevance for language preference, indicating that citation choices are not always driven by informativeness alone. Our findings shed light on how language models leverage multilingual context and influence citation behavior.

Abstract: High-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS) model training requires extensive and diverse text and speech data. It is challenging to procure such data from real sources due to issues of domain specificity, licensing, and scalability. Large language models (LLMs) can certainly generate textual data, but they create repetitive text with insufficient variation in the prompt during the generation process. Another important aspect in TTS training data is text normalization. Tools for normalization might occasionally introduce anomalies or overlook valuable patterns, and thus impact data quality. Furthermore, it is also impractical to rely on voice artists for large scale speech recording in commercial TTS systems with standardized voices. To address these challenges, we propose SpeechWeave, a synthetic speech data generation pipeline that is capable of automating the generation of multilingual, domain-specific datasets for training TTS models. Our experiments reveal that our pipeline generates data that is 10-48% more diverse than the baseline across various linguistic and phonetic metrics, along with speaker-standardized speech audio while generating approximately 97% correctly normalized text. Our approach enables scalable, high-quality data generation for TTS training, improving diversity, normalization, and voice consistency in the generated datasets.

Abstract: Domain reweighting is an emerging research area aimed at adjusting the relative weights of different data sources to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM pre-training. We show that data mixtures that perform well at smaller scales may not retain their advantage at larger scales, challenging the existing practice of determining competitive mixtures in small-scale experiments and directly applying them at much larger scales. To address this, we propose AutoScale, a two-stage, scale-aware data composition framework. First, AutoScale fits a parametric model that predicts the model's loss under different data compositions, then uses it to find an approximate best allocation at smaller, more manageable budgets. Next, leveraging a novel theoretical analysis of how optimal compositions evolve with scale, AutoScale extrapolates that composition to larger budgets without further retraining. Empirically, AutoScale accelerates convergence and improves downstream performance. For instance, when pre-training GPT-2 Large, it achieves a 28% faster perplexity reduction than baselines and up to a 38% speed-up over unweighted training, while yielding best-average results on various downstream tasks. Overall, our findings illustrate how domain importance shifts with training scale, underscoring the need for scale-dependent data curation in LLM training. Our code is open-sourced.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) perform well on many tasks but often fail at spatial reasoning, which is essential for navigation and interaction with physical environments. Many spatial reasoning tasks depend on fundamental two-dimensional (2D) skills, yet our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art VLMs give implausible or incorrect answers to composite spatial problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans solve effortlessly. To address this, we enhance 2D spatial reasoning in VLMs by training them only on basic spatial capabilities. We first disentangle 2D spatial reasoning into three core components: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. We hypothesize that mastering these skills substantially improves performance on complex spatial tasks that require advanced reasoning and combinatorial problem solving, while also generalizing to real-world scenarios. To test this, we introduce Sparkle, a framework that generates synthetic data to provide targeted supervision across these three capabilities and yields an instruction dataset for each. Experiments show that VLMs fine-tuned with \emph{Sparkle} improve not only on basic tasks but also on composite and out-of-distribution real-world spatial reasoning tasks. These results indicate that enhancing basic spatial skills through synthetic generalization effectively advances complex spatial reasoning and offers a systematic strategy for boosting the spatial understanding of VLMs. Source codes of Sparkle are available at https://github.com/YihongT/Sparkle.

Abstract: Software repositories contain valuable information for understanding the development process. However, extracting insights from repository data is time-consuming and requires technical expertise. While software engineering chatbots support natural language interactions with repositories, chatbots struggle to understand questions beyond their trained intents and to accurately retrieve the relevant data. This study aims to improve the accuracy of LLM-based chatbots in answering repository-related questions by augmenting them with knowledge graphs. We use a two-step approach: constructing a knowledge graph from repository data, and synergizing the knowledge graph with an LLM to handle natural language questions and answers. We curated 150 questions of varying complexity and evaluated the approach on five popular open-source projects. Our initial results revealed the limitations of the approach, with most errors due to the reasoning ability of the LLM. We therefore applied few-shot chain-of-thought prompting, which improved accuracy to 84%. We also compared against baselines (MSRBot and GPT-4o-search-preview), and our approach performed significantly better. In a task-based user study with 20 participants, users completed more tasks correctly and in less time with our approach, and they reported that it was useful. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs and knowledge graphs are a viable solution for making repository data accessible.

Abstract: C-to-Rust transpilation is essential for modernizing legacy C code while enhancing safety and interoperability with modern Rust ecosystems. However, no dataset currently exists for evaluating whether a system can transpile C into safe Rust that passes a set of test cases. We introduce CRUST-Bench, a dataset of 100 C repositories, each paired with manually-written interfaces in safe Rust as well as test cases that can be used to validate correctness of the transpilation. By considering entire repositories rather than isolated functions, CRUST-Bench captures the challenges of translating complex projects with dependencies across multiple files. The provided Rust interfaces provide explicit specifications that ensure adherence to idiomatic, memory-safe Rust patterns, while the accompanying test cases enforce functional correctness. We evaluate state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on this task and find that safe and idiomatic Rust generation is still a challenging problem for various state-of-the-art methods and techniques. We also provide insights into the errors LLMs usually make in transpiling code from C to safe Rust. The best performing model, OpenAI o1, is able to solve only 15 tasks in a single-shot setting. Improvements on CRUST-Bench would lead to improved transpilation systems that can reason about complex scenarios and help in migrating legacy codebases from C into languages like Rust that ensure memory safety.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) has led to notable improvements on mathematical benchmarks. However, many of the most commonly used evaluation datasets (e.g., AIME 2024) are widely available online, making it difficult to disentangle genuine reasoning from potential memorization. Furthermore, these benchmarks do not evaluate proof-writing capabilities, which are crucial for many mathematical tasks. To address this, we introduce MathArena, a new benchmark based on the following key insight: recurring math competitions provide a stream of high-quality, challenging problems that can be used for real-time evaluation of LLMs. By evaluating models as soon as new problems are released, we effectively eliminate the risk of contamination. Using this framework, we find strong signs of contamination in AIME 2024. Nonetheless, evaluations on harder competitions, such as CMIMC 2025, demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities in top-performing models. MathArena is also the first benchmark for proof-writing capabilities. On IMO 2025, top models achieve slightly less than 40%, demonstrating both notable progress and significant room for improvement. So far, we have evaluated over $50$ models across seven competitions, totaling $162$ problems. As an evolving benchmark, MathArena will continue to track the progress of LLMs on newly released competitions, ensuring rigorous and up-to-date evaluation of mathematical reasoning.

<title>Differential Information Distribution: A Bayesian Perspective on Direct Preference Optimization</title>

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been widely used for aligning language models with human preferences in a supervised manner. However, several key questions remain unresolved: the rationale behind its log-ratio reward, how the statistical structure of preference datasets shapes its training dynamics, and how those dynamics impact downstream capabilities. We approach these questions from a Bayesian perspective, interpreting the goal of preference optimization as learning the differential information required to update a reference policy into a target policy. To formalize this view, we introduce the Differential Information Distribution (DID), defined as the distribution over samples that carry the Bayesian evidence required to update policies. We introduce three complementary insights by viewing preference optimization through the DID. First, we find that DPO's log-ratio reward is uniquely justified when preferences encode the Differential Information needed to update a reference policy into the target policy. Second, we discuss how commonly observed training dynamics in DPO, including changes in log-likelihood and policy exploration, stem from a power-law DID relationship. Finally, we analyze how training dynamics influence downstream performance using the entropy of DID, a principled measure of uncertainty in the learned information. We observe that learning high-entropy DID improves open-ended instruction-following, while low-entropy DID benefits knowledge-intensive QA. Taken together, our results show that DPO's reward design, training dynamics, and downstream capabilities all emerge as natural consequences of learning Differential Information, offering both a principled theoretical foundation and practical guidance for preference-based alignment.

<title>DrKGC: Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph Completion across General and Biomedical Domains</title>

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples in knowledge graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing triples and textual information. Recently, generative large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for graph tasks. However, current approaches typically encode graph context in textual form, which fails to fully exploit the potential of LLMs for perceiving and reasoning about graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph Completion). DrKGC employs a flexible lightweight model training strategy to learn structural embeddings and logical rules within the KG. It then leverages a novel bottom-up graph retrieval method to extract a subgraph for each query guided by the learned rules. Finally, a graph convolutional network (GCN) adapter uses the retrieved subgraph to enhance the structural embeddings, which are then integrated into the prompt for effective LLM fine-tuning. Experimental results on two general domain benchmark datasets and two biomedical datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DrKGC. Furthermore, a realistic case study in the biomedical domain highlights its interpretability and practical utility.

Abstract: Long document question answering systems typically process texts as flat sequences or use arbitrary segmentation, failing to capture discourse structures that guide human comprehension. We present a discourse-aware hierarchical framework that leverages rhetorical structure theory (RST) to enhance long document question answering. Our approach converts discourse trees into sentence-level representations and employs LLM-enhanced node representations to bridge structural and semantic information. The framework involves three key innovations: specialized discourse parsing for lengthy documents, LLM-based enhancement of discourse relation nodes, and structure-guided hierarchical retrieval. Comprehensive experiments on QASPER, QuALITY, and NarrativeQA demonstrate consistent improvements over existing approaches. Ablation studies confirm that incorporating discourse structure significantly enhances question answering across diverse document types.

Abstract: Recent advancements in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, particularly through the Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm used by DeepSeek-R1, have led to significant interest in the potential of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for Large Language Models (LLMs). While RLVR promises to improve reasoning by allowing models to learn from free exploration, there remains debate over whether it truly enhances reasoning abilities or simply boosts sampling efficiency. This paper systematically investigates the impact of RLVR on LLM reasoning. We revisit Pass@K experiments and demonstrate that RLVR can extend the reasoning boundary for both mathematical and coding tasks. This is supported by our introduction of a novel evaluation metric, CoT-Pass@K, which captures reasoning success by accounting for both the final answer and intermediate reasoning steps. Furthermore, we present a theoretical framework explaining RLVR's incentive mechanism, demonstrating how it can encourage correct reasoning even when rewards are based solely on answer correctness. Our analysis of RLVR's training dynamics reveals that it incentivizes correct reasoning early in the process, with substantial improvements in reasoning quality confirmed through extensive evaluations. These findings provide strong evidence of RLVR's potential to enhance LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights into its mechanisms and performance improvements.

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000 pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model (MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA (TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module, inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing training resource consumption by a substantial margin.

arXiv:2507.15887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite progress in language model (LM) capabilities, evaluations have thus far focused on models' performance on tasks that humans have previously solved, including in programming (Jimenez et al., 2024) and mathematics (Glazer et al., 2024). We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance.

Abstract: We introduce PurpCode, the first post-training recipe for training safe code reasoning models towards generating secure code and defending against malicious cyberactivities. PurpCode trains a reasoning model in two stages: (i) Rule Learning, which explicitly teaches the model to reference cybersafety rules to generate vulnerability-free code and to avoid facilitating malicious cyberactivities; and (ii) Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes model safety and preserves model utility through diverse, multi-objective reward mechanisms. To empower the training pipelines with comprehensive cybersafety data, we conduct internal red-teaming to synthesize comprehensive and high-coverage prompts based on real-world tasks for inducing unsafe cyberactivities in the model. Based on PurpCode, we develop a reasoning-based coding model, namely PurpCode-32B, which demonstrates state-of-the-art cybersafety, outperforming various frontier models. Meanwhile, our alignment method decreases the model overrefusal rates in both general and cybersafety-specific scenarios, while preserving model utility in both code generation and common security knowledge.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to augment large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks. However, its effectiveness is often undermined by the presence of noisy (i.e., low-quality) retrieved passages. Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is critical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have equipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing them to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by this ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that explicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming to enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We validate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the retriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA datasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG performance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise, where the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise, where it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently improves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can also effectively leverage helpful passages. These findings suggest that incorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising direction for building more robust RAG systems. The code can be found \href{here}{https://github.com/Trustworthy-Information-Access/Passage-Injection}.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets, with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight, cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for GenAI use cases across various platforms.

Abstract: AI-driven materials discovery that couples automated experimentation with algorithmic decision-making requires process aware recipe to property predictors that are accurate, calibrated, and physically admissible. We approach this as a reasoning problem with large reasoning models (LRMs). To instill reasoning capability into language models, we curate reasoning traces from a teacher model to train a student model. However, most training pipelines select reasoning traces using binary correctness or learned preference signals that poorly reflect physical admissibility. We introduce Physics-aware Rejection Sampling (PaRS), a training-time trace selection scheme that favors traces consistent with fundamental physics and numerically close to targets, with lightweight halting to control compute. We instantiate our framework with a large student model fine-tuned on traces synthesized by a larger teacher model, and evaluate under matched token budgets against various rejection sampling baselines. Our method improves accuracy and calibration, reduces physics-violation rates, and lowers sampling cost relative to baselines. These results indicate that modest, domain-aware constraints combined with trace-level selection provide a practical path toward reliable, efficient LRMs for process-aware property prediction and closed-loop materials design.

Abstract: Guardian models are used to supervise and moderate the outputs of user-facing chatbots, enforcing guardrails and detecting bad behaviors. Standard guardian models like LlamaGuard detect predefined, static categories of harms. We propose dynamic guardian models that evaluate text based on user-defined policies, making them useful for different application domains that are not addressed by standard guardian models. Our dynamic guardian models can be used for fast detection of policy violations or with chain-of-thought reasoning that articulates and justifies the model outputs. Our dynamic guardian models match static models in detection accuracy for static harm categories while identifying violations of free-form policies with accuracy comparable to frontier reasoning models in a fraction of the time.

Summary: 
The article introduces DeeptraceReward, a benchmark dataset focused on human-perceived fake traces in AI-generated videos. It consists of 4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K videos, categorizing deepfake traces into 9 major categories. Multimodal language models are trained on this dataset to mimic human judgments. The 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by 34.7% on average in identifying fake clues, grounding, and explanations. It highlights the difficulty gradient in deepfake trace detection, with natural language explanations being the easiest and temporal labeling being the hardest. DeeptraceReward serves as a testbed for socially aware and trustworthy video generation, providing a rigorous training signal for AI models. <div>

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons? While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension -- whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e., spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises 4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by 34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation. Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s. real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest). By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video generation.

Summary:
Machine unlearning is a novel technique that aims to remove the influence of certain training data from a model without retraining, with applications in privacy protection, content moderation, and model correction. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often rely on external resources, which can be impractical and pose privacy risks. In this work, a new approach called Direct Token Optimization (DTO) is proposed for LLMs, eliminating the need for external resources by directly optimizing token-level objectives. DTO categorizes tokens into target and non-target tokens, optimizing the unlearning objective with the former while preserving model performance with the latter. Experimental results demonstrate that DTO outperforms existing baselines by up to 16.8 times in forget quality on benchmark datasets while maintaining comparable model utility.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Machine unlearning is an emerging technique that removes the influence of a subset of training data (forget set) from a model without full retraining, with applications including privacy protection, content moderation, and model correction. The key challenge lies in ensuring that the model completely forgets the knowledge of the forget set without compromising its overall utility. Existing unlearning methods for large language models (LLMs) often utilize auxiliary language models, retain datasets, or even commercial AI services for effective unlearning and maintaining the model utility. However, dependence on these external resources is often impractical and could potentially introduce additional privacy risks. In this work, we propose direct token optimization (DTO), a novel self-contained unlearning approach for LLMs that directly optimizes the token level objectives and eliminates the need for external resources. Given a sequence to unlearn, we identify two categories of tokens: target tokens, which capture critical knowledge for unlearning, and the remaining non-target tokens, which are crucial for maintaining the model utility. The former are used to optimize the unlearning objective, while the latter serve to preserve the model's performance. The experimental results show that the proposed DTO achieves up to 16.8$\times$ improvement in forget quality on several benchmark datasets than the latest baselines while maintaining a comparable level of model utility.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel framework called TAMA, which stands for Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent, designed for procedural activity understanding. TAMA enables multimodal reasoning by utilizing multimedia-returning tools in a training-free setting. Experimental results on the ProMQA-Assembly dataset demonstrate that TAMA improves the performance of vision-language models, especially GPT-5 and MiMo-VL. The study also includes ablation studies that confirm the effectiveness of two key features of the framework: multimedia-returning tools and agentic flexible tool selection. Overall, the proposed framework and experimental results contribute to advancing the thinking with images paradigm for video and multimodal tasks, as well as the development of procedural activity assistants.

Abstract: Procedural activity assistants potentially support humans in a variety of settings, from our daily lives, e.g., cooking or assembling flat-pack furniture, to professional situations, e.g., manufacturing or biological experiments. Despite its potential use cases, the system development tailored for such an assistant is still underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called TAMA, a Tool-Augmented Multimodal Agent, for procedural activity understanding. TAMA enables interleaved multimodal reasoning by making use of multimedia-returning tools in a training-free setting. Our experimental result on the multimodal procedural QA dataset, ProMQA-Assembly, shows that our approach can improve the performance of vision-language models, especially GPT-5 and MiMo-VL. Furthermore, our ablation studies provide empirical support for the effectiveness of two features that characterize our framework, multimedia-returning tools and agentic flexible tool selection. We believe our proposed framework and experimental results facilitate the thinking with images paradigm for video and multimodal tasks, let alone the development of procedural activity assistants.

Abstract: We introduce DRBench, a benchmark for evaluating AI agents on complex, open-ended deep research tasks in enterprise settings. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on simple questions or web-only queries, DRBench evaluates agents on multi-step queries (for example, ``What changes should we make to our product roadmap to ensure compliance with this standard?") that require identifying supporting facts from both the public web and private company knowledge base. Each task is grounded in realistic user personas and enterprise context, spanning a heterogeneous search space that includes productivity software, cloud file systems, emails, chat conversations, and the open web. Tasks are generated through a carefully designed synthesis pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, and agents are evaluated on their ability to recall relevant insights, maintain factual accuracy, and produce coherent, well-structured reports. We release 15 deep research tasks across 10 domains, such as Sales, Cybersecurity, and Compliance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DRBench by evaluating diverse DR agents across open- and closed-source models (such as GPT, Llama, and Qwen) and DR strategies, highlighting their strengths, weaknesses, and the critical path for advancing enterprise deep research.

Following prior research, we investigate this question in the domain of opinion prediction by developing PrimeX, a dataset of public opinion survey data from 858 US residents with two additional sources of belief information: written explanations from the respondents for why they hold specific opinions, and the Primal World Belief survey for assessing respondent worldview. We provide an extensive initial analysis of our data and show the value of belief explanations and worldview for personalizing language models. Our results demonstrate how the additional belief information in PrimeX can benefit both the NLP and psychological research communities, opening up avenues for further study.

<div> personalized reasoning, large language model, preferences, interactive personalization, evaluation methodology <br />
Summary:<br />
The article discusses the limitations of current large language models (LLMs) in adequately addressing user preferences in human-facing applications. It introduces the concept of personalized reasoning, where LLMs need to strategically elicit and adapt to user preferences through questioning. The PREFDISCO evaluation methodology transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences. The evaluation of 21 frontier models across 10 tasks shows that generic responses often fail to serve individual user needs effectively, while naive attempts at personalization can result in worse preference alignment. The findings suggest that personalized reasoning does not naturally emerge in LLMs and requires dedicated development efforts. The study establishes personalized reasoning as a measurable research frontier and highlights the need for developing systems that can adapt to individual user needs in critical domains such as education, healthcare, and technical fields. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) development treats task-solving and preference alignment as separate challenges, optimizing first for objective correctness, then for alignment to aggregated human preferences. This paradigm fails in human-facing applications where solving a problem correctly is insufficient if the response mismatches the user's needs. This challenge intensifies in just-in-time scenarios where no prior user interaction history exists due to cold-start conditions or privacy constraints. LLMs need to identify what they don't know about user preferences, strategically elicit preference values through questioning, then adapt their reasoning processes and responses accordingly -- a complicated chain of cognitive processes which we term personalized reasoning. We introduce PREFDISCO, an evaluation methodology that transforms static benchmarks into interactive personalization tasks using psychologically-grounded personas with sparse preferences. Our framework creates scenarios where identical questions require different reasoning chains depending on user context, as optimal explanation approaches vary by individual expertise and preferences while maintaining factual accuracy. Evaluation of 21 frontier models across 10 tasks reveals 29.0% of naive personalization attempts produce worse preference alignment than generic responses, yet generic responses also fail to serve individual user needs effectively. These findings suggest personalized reasoning requires dedicated development rather than emerging naturally. PREFDISCO establishes personalized reasoning as a measurable research frontier and reveals fundamental limitations in current LLMs' interactive capabilities, providing a foundation for developing systems that can adapt to individual users in education, healthcare, and technical domains where personalization is critical.

<div> Benchmark, Bias mitigation methods, Large language models, Evaluation, Debiasing performance <br />
Summary: <br />
The study introduces BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that evaluates eight mainstream bias mitigation techniques for large language models (LLMs) in two test scenarios: multi-choice QA and open-ended multi-turn QA. A response-level metric called Bias-Free Score is introduced to measure the fairness, safety, and anti-stereotypical nature of LLM responses. The comparison includes prompting-based and training-based methods, assessing their performance across key dimensions such as model size, generalization of training strategies, and the prompting vs. training paradigm. The goal is to provide a unified testbed for bias mitigation research and bridge the gap between existing evaluation methods and real-world use cases where fair and safe interactions with LLMs are essential. The benchmark will be publicly released to facilitate consistent evaluation and analysis of bias mitigation methods for LLMs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Existing studies on bias mitigation methods for large language models (LLMs) use diverse baselines and metrics to evaluate debiasing performance, leading to inconsistent comparisons among them. Moreover, their evaluations are mostly based on the comparison between LLMs' probabilities of biased and unbiased contexts, which ignores the gap between such evaluations and real-world use cases where users interact with LLMs by reading model responses and expect fair and safe outputs rather than LLMs' probabilities. To enable consistent evaluation across debiasing methods and bridge this gap, we introduce BiasFreeBench, an empirical benchmark that comprehensively compares eight mainstream bias mitigation techniques (covering four prompting-based and four training-based methods) on two test scenarios (multi-choice QA and open-ended multi-turn QA) by reorganizing existing datasets into a unified query-response setting. We further introduce a response-level metric, Bias-Free Score, to measure the extent to which LLM responses are fair, safe, and anti-stereotypical. Debiasing performances are systematically compared and analyzed across key dimensions: the prompting vs. training paradigm, model size, and generalization of different training strategies to unseen bias types. We will publicly release our benchmark, aiming to establish a unified testbed for bias mitigation research.

Abstract: We introduce TASER (Translation Assessment via Systematic Evaluation and Reasoning), a metric that uses Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) for automated translation quality assessment. TASER harnesses the explicit reasoning capabilities of LRMs to conduct systematic, step-by-step evaluation of translation quality. We evaluate TASER on the WMT24 Metrics Shared Task across both reference-based and reference-free scenarios, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. In system-level evaluation, TASER achieves the highest soft pairwise accuracy in both reference-based and reference-free settings, outperforming all existing metrics. At the segment level, TASER maintains competitive performance with our reference-free variant ranking as the top-performing metric among all reference-free approaches. Our experiments reveal that structured prompting templates yield superior results with LRMs compared to the open-ended approaches that proved optimal for traditional LLMs. We evaluate o3, a large reasoning model from OpenAI, with varying reasoning efforts, providing insights into the relationship between reasoning depth and evaluation quality. The explicit reasoning process in LRMs offers interpretability and visibility, addressing a key limitation of existing automated metrics. Our results demonstrate that Large Reasoning Models show a measurable advancement in translation quality assessment, combining improved accuracy with transparent evaluation across diverse language pairs.

Summary: 
Generative Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs) are gaining interest for generating textual responses based on ECG signals and textual queries. The use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in ELMs helps improve natural language generation by grounding outputs in retrieved knowledge, reducing hallucinations. This study introduces an open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, providing baselines and conducting ablation studies on NLG. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that ELMs with RAG consistently outperform non-RAG baselines and highlight important ELM design considerations. The code for this work is available on GitHub at https://github.com/willxxy/ECG-Bench.<br /><br />Summary: Generative Electrocardiogram-Language Models are enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation, as shown in an open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs. Experiments prove the effectiveness of RAG in improving natural language generation and shed light on key design considerations for ELMs. <div>

Abstract: Interest in generative Electrocardiogram-Language Models (ELMs) is growing, as they can produce textual responses conditioned on ECG signals and textual queries. Unlike traditional classifiers that output label probabilities, ELMs are more versatile, supporting domain-specific tasks (e.g., waveform analysis, diagnosis, prognosis) as well as general tasks (e.g., open-ended questions, dialogue). Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), widely used in Large Language Models (LLMs) to ground LLM outputs in retrieved knowledge, helps reduce hallucinations and improve natural language generation (NLG). However, despite its promise, no open-source implementation or systematic study of RAG pipeline design for ELMs currently exists. To address this gap, we present the first open-source RAG pipeline for ELMs, along with baselines and ablation studies for NLG. Experiments on three public datasets show that ELMs with RAG consistently improves performance over non-RAG baselines and highlights key ELM design considerations. Our code is available at: https://github.com/willxxy/ECG-Bench.

Summary: 
The article discusses the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values using autoraters trained on discrete preference labels. It argues that autoraters should model the full distribution of preferences in a target population for reliability. The paper introduces a framework for calibrating probabilistic autoraters to any given preference distribution. It presents two learning methods: direct supervised fine-tuning for dense labels and reinforcement learning for sparse labels. Empirical results show that fine-tuning autoraters with a distribution-matching objective improves alignment with target preferences, calibration, and reduces positional bias while maintaining performance on objective tasks. This approach benefits from verbalized probability predictions that better reflect the target preference distribution. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values increasingly relies on using other LLMs as automated judges, or ``autoraters''. However, their reliability is limited by a foundational issue: they are trained on discrete preference labels, forcing a single ground truth onto tasks that are often subjective, ambiguous, or nuanced. We argue that a reliable autorater must learn to model the full distribution of preferences defined by a target population. In this paper, we propose a general framework for calibrating probabilistic autoraters to any given preference distribution. We formalize the problem and present two learning methods tailored to different data conditions: 1) a direct supervised fine-tuning for dense, probabilistic labels, and 2) a reinforcement learning approach for sparse, binary labels. Our empirical results show that finetuning autoraters with a distribution-matching objective leads to verbalized probability predictions that are better aligned with the target preference distribution, with improved calibration and significantly lower positional bias, all while preserving performance on objective tasks.

<div> Language Models, Text Classification, Fine-tuning, Parameter-efficient, Text Revision<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at text generation tasks but are underutilized for text classification. Traditional fine-tuning methods struggle with nuanced tasks like text revision due to the scarcity of annotated data. A new framework, IR-Tuning, implements layer-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning by dynamically selecting important LLM layers based on gradient norms. This approach outperforms baseline methods in classifying text revisions, demonstrating fast convergence, low GPU memory usage, and effectiveness with limited data. By focusing on key layers, IR-Tuning enhances LLM performance in simple yet crucial classification tasks and may pave the way for broader applications of LLM technology beyond text generation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.00268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown extraordinary success across various text generation tasks; however, their potential for simple yet essential text classification remains underexplored, as LLM pre-training tends to emphasize generation over classification. While LLMs with instruction tuning can transform classification into a generation task, they often struggle to categorize nuanced texts. One such example is text revision, which involves nuanced edits between pairs of texts. Although simply fine-tuning LLMs for revision classification seems plausible, it requires a large amount of revision annotations, which are exceptionally expensive and scarce in the community. To address this issue, we introduce a plug-and-play layer-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework, i.e., IR-Tuning, which fine-tunes a subset of important LLM layers that are dynamically selected based on their gradient norm distribution, while freezing those of redundant layers. Extensive experiments suggest that IR-Tuning surpasses several layer-wise PEFT baselines over diverse text revisions, while achieving fast convergence, low GPU memory consumption, and effectiveness on small revision corpora.

<div> Keywords: Black box large language models, information extraction, safe passage, SafePassage pipeline, transformer encoder

Summary:
- The paper introduces the concept of a "safe passage" in black box large language models (LLMs) to ensure extracted information is grounded in the document and consistent.
- The SafePassage pipeline consists of an LLM extractor, a global aligner, and a scoring model to reduce hallucinations in information extraction tasks.
- Results demonstrate that the pipeline can effectively reduce hallucinations by up to 85% while maintaining minimal risk of flagging non-hallucinations.
- The pipeline shows high agreement with human judgments on extraction quality, making it useful for evaluating LLMs.
- Surprisingly, a transformer encoder fine-tuned on a small number of task-specific examples outperformed an LLM scoring model in flagging unsafe passages, with annotations collected in a short timeframe.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black box large language models (LLMs) make information extraction (IE) easy to configure, but hard to trust. Unlike traditional information extraction pipelines, the information "extracted" is not guaranteed to be grounded in the document. To prevent this, this paper introduces the notion of a "safe passage": context generated by the LLM that is both grounded in the document and consistent with the extracted information. This is operationalized via a three-step pipeline, SafePassage, which consists of: (1) an LLM extractor that generates structured entities and their contexts from a document, (2) a string-based global aligner, and (3) a scoring model. Results show that using these three parts in conjunction reduces hallucinations by up to 85% on information extraction tasks with minimal risk of flagging non-hallucinations. High agreement between the SafePassage pipeline and human judgments of extraction quality mean that the pipeline can be dually used to evaluate LLMs. Surprisingly, results also show that using a transformer encoder fine-tuned on a small number of task-specific examples can outperform an LLM scoring model at flagging unsafe passages. These annotations can be collected in as little as 1-2 hours.

The article discusses the limitations of existing evaluation metrics for automatically generated radiology reports and proposes a new clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework. The framework includes criteria related to clinical alignment, discrimination, robustness, and monotonicity. Using a dataset of ground truth and rewritten report pairs annotated with error types and clinical significance, the authors evaluate existing metrics and identify issues such as difficulty in distinguishing clinically significant errors, penalizing harmless variations, and inconsistency in evaluating error severity levels. The proposed framework aims to guide the development of more clinically reliable evaluation methods for radiology report generation. <div>

Abstract: Automatically generated radiology reports often receive high scores from existing evaluation metrics but fail to earn clinicians' trust. This gap reveals fundamental flaws in how current metrics assess the quality of generated reports. We rethink the design and evaluation of these metrics and propose a clinically grounded Meta-Evaluation framework. We define clinically grounded criteria spanning clinical alignment and key metric capabilities, including discrimination, robustness, and monotonicity. Using a fine-grained dataset of ground truth and rewritten report pairs annotated with error types, clinical significance labels, and explanations, we systematically evaluate existing metrics and reveal their limitations in interpreting clinical semantics, such as failing to distinguish clinically significant errors, over-penalizing harmless variations, and lacking consistency across error severity levels. Our framework offers guidance for building more clinically reliable evaluation methods.

Abstract: The proliferation of transformer-based language models has revolutionized NLP domain while simultaneously introduced significant challenges regarding model transparency and trustworthiness. The complexity of achieving explainable systems in this domain is evidenced by the extensive array of explanation methods and evaluation metrics developed by researchers.

Summary: 
The article introduces CORTEX, a multi-agent LLM architecture designed to address alert fatigue and improve alert triage in Security Operations Centers. By utilizing specialized agents that collaborate to analyze real evidence, such as behavior-analysis agents and evidence-gathering agents, CORTEX aims to reduce false positives and enhance investigation quality in high-stakes scenarios. The proposed architecture moves away from single-agent models and offers improved transparency and flexibility in handling noisy enterprise data. A dataset of fine-grained SOC investigations is released to support training and evaluation of CORTEX. Overall, CORTEX demonstrates significant advancements over traditional detection pipelines by effectively reducing the overwhelming number of false alerts and improving the overall effectiveness of security incident response in enterprise environments. <div>
arXiv:2510.00311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are overwhelmed by tens of thousands of daily alerts, with only a small fraction corresponding to genuine attacks. This overload creates alert fatigue, leading to overlooked threats and analyst burnout. Classical detection pipelines are brittle and context-poor, while recent LLM-based approaches typically rely on a single model to interpret logs, retrieve context, and adjudicate alerts end-to-end -- an approach that struggles with noisy enterprise data and offers limited transparency. We propose CORTEX, a multi-agent LLM architecture for high-stakes alert triage in which specialized agents collaborate over real evidence: a behavior-analysis agent inspects activity sequences, evidence-gathering agents query external systems, and a reasoning agent synthesizes findings into an auditable decision. To support training and evaluation, we release a dataset of fine-grained SOC investigations from production environments, capturing step-by-step analyst actions and linked tool outputs. Across diverse enterprise scenarios, CORTEX substantially reduces false positives and improves investigation quality over state-of-the-art single-agent LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models rely heavily on prompts to specify tasks, recall knowledge and guide reasoning. However, this reliance is inefficient as prompts must be re-read at each step, scale poorly across tasks, and lack mechanisms for modular reuse. We introduce TokMem, a tokenized procedural memory that stores recurring procedures as compact, trainable embeddings. Each memory token encodes both an address to a procedure and a control signal that steers generation, enabling targeted behavior with constant-size overhead. To support continual adaptation, TokMem keeps the backbone model frozen, allowing new procedures to be added without interfering with existing ones. We evaluate TokMem on 1,000 tasks for atomic recall, and on function-calling tasks for compositional recall, where it consistently outperforms retrieval-augmented generation while avoiding repeated context overhead, and fine-tuning with far fewer parameters. These results establish TokMem as a scalable and modular alternative to prompt engineering and fine-tuning, offering an explicit procedural memory for LLMs.

Summary:
LongCodeZip is a new code compression framework designed for code Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle long contexts efficiently. It employs a dual-stage strategy: coarse-grained compression to identify and rank function-level chunks and fine-grained compression to select an optimal subset of functions while maximizing relevance under an adaptive token budget. Evaluations across various tasks show that LongCodeZip outperforms baseline methods with up to a 5.6x compression ratio without compromising task performance. By reducing context size while preserving essential information, LongCodeZip enhances the scalability of LLMs in real-world, large-scale code scenarios, improving the efficiency and capability of code intelligence applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code generation under long contexts is becoming increasingly critical as Large Language Models (LLMs) are required to reason over extensive information in the codebase. While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs, high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to suboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose LongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed specifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1) coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information, LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence applications.

Personalizing Likert-scale rating prediction using large language models (LLMs) is a growing research area. This study explores the performance of off-the-shelf LLMs on rating prediction tasks, showing that user-written reviews significantly enhance their accuracy, on par with traditional methods like matrix factorization. Reviews specific to items are more effective than general preference descriptions. Prompting LLMs to generate hypothetical reviews before prediction improves performance.

arXiv:2510.00449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalizing the outputs of large language models (LLMs) to align with individual user preferences is an active research area. However, previous studies have mainly focused on classification or ranking tasks and have not considered Likert-scale rating prediction, a regression task that requires both language and mathematical reasoning to be solved effectively. This task has significant industrial applications, but the utilization of LLMs remains underexplored, particularly regarding the capabilities of off-the-shelf LLMs. This study investigates the performance of off-the-shelf LLMs on rating prediction, providing different in-context information. Through comprehensive experiments with eight models across three datasets, we demonstrate that user-written reviews significantly improve the rating prediction performance of LLMs. This result is comparable to traditional methods like matrix factorization, highlighting the potential of LLMs as a promising solution for the cold-start problem. We also find that the reviews for concrete items are more effective than general preference descriptions that are not based on any specific item. Furthermore, we discover that prompting LLMs to first generate a hypothetical review enhances the rating prediction performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/ynklab/rating-prediction-with-reviews.

Abstract: Agentic large language models (LLMs) have become prominent for autonomously interacting with external environments and performing multi-step reasoning tasks. Most approaches leverage these capabilities via in-context learning with few-shot prompts, but this often results in lengthy inputs and higher computational costs. Agent fine-tuning offers an alternative by enabling LLMs to internalize procedural reasoning and domain-specific knowledge through training on relevant data and demonstration trajectories. While prior studies have focused on general domains, their effectiveness in specialized technical microdomains remains unclear. This paper explores agent fine-tuning for domain adaptation within Hitachi's JP1 middleware, a microdomain for specialized IT operations. We fine-tuned LLMs using JP1-specific datasets derived from domain manuals and distilled reasoning trajectories generated by LLMs themselves, enhancing decision making accuracy and search efficiency. During inference, we used an agentic prompt with retrieval-augmented generation and introduced a context-answer extractor to improve information relevance. On JP1 certification exam questions, our method achieved a 14% performance improvement over the base model, demonstrating the potential of agent fine-tuning for domain-specific reasoning in complex microdomains.

<div> probing framework, multimodal agents, reasoning capabilities, memorization, GUI benchmarks 

Summary:
Agent-ScanKit is a probing framework designed to assess the memory and reasoning capabilities of multimodal agents in graphical user interface (GUI) tasks. Three probing paradigms - visual-guided, text-guided, and structure-guided - are utilized to evaluate the agents' ability to memorize and reason without access to internal model details. The study, involving 18 multimodal agents across five GUI benchmarks, reveals that memorization tends to overshadow systematic reasoning in these agents. The majority of models rely heavily on memorized knowledge aligned with their training data, resulting in limited generalization. The findings emphasize the importance of developing robust reasoning models for multimodal agents to enhance their reliability in real-world scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Although numerous strategies have recently been proposed to enhance the autonomous interaction capabilities of multimodal agents in graphical user interface (GUI), their reliability remains limited when faced with complex or out-of-domain tasks. This raises a fundamental question: Are existing multimodal agents reasoning spuriously? In this paper, we propose \textbf{Agent-ScanKit}, a systematic probing framework to unravel the memory and reasoning capabilities of multimodal agents under controlled perturbations. Specifically, we introduce three orthogonal probing paradigms: visual-guided, text-guided, and structure-guided, each designed to quantify the contributions of memorization and reasoning without requiring access to model internals. In five publicly available GUI benchmarks involving 18 multimodal agents, the results demonstrate that mechanical memorization often outweighs systematic reasoning. Most of the models function predominantly as retrievers of training-aligned knowledge, exhibiting limited generalization. Our findings underscore the necessity of robust reasoning modeling for multimodal agents in real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights toward the development of reliable multimodal agents.

Summary: 
MOSS-Speech is a novel speech-to-speech large language model that eliminates the need for text intermediates in spoken dialogue systems. By leveraging a modality-based layer-splitting architecture and a frozen pre-training strategy, MOSS-Speech directly understands and generates speech without relying on text guidance. The model outperforms existing systems in spoken question answering and demonstrates competitive speech-to-speech performance while maintaining strong text performance. This approach bridges the gap between text-guided and direct speech generation, offering a new paradigm for expressive and efficient end-to-end speech interaction. By preserving paralinguistic cues and enhancing expressivity, MOSS-Speech paves the way for more natural and intuitive spoken interactions. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spoken dialogue systems often rely on cascaded pipelines that transcribe, process, and resynthesize speech. While effective, this design discards paralinguistic cues and limits expressivity. Recent end-to-end methods reduce latency and better preserve these cues, yet still rely on text intermediates, creating a fundamental bottleneck. We present MOSS-Speech, a true speech-to-speech large language model that directly understands and generates speech without relying on text guidance. Our approach combines a modality-based layer-splitting architecture with a frozen pre-training strategy, preserving the reasoning and knowledge of pretrained text LLMs while adding native speech capabilities. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results in spoken question answering and delivers comparable speech-to-speech performance relative to existing text-guided systems, while still maintaining competitive text performance. By narrowing the gap between text-guided and direct speech generation, our work establishes a new paradigm for expressive and efficient end-to-end speech interaction.

arXiv:2510.00507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As multimodal LLM-driven agents continue to advance in autonomy and generalization, evaluation based on static datasets can no longer adequately assess their true capabilities in dynamic environments and diverse tasks. Existing LLM-based synthetic data methods are largely designed for LLM training and evaluation, and thus cannot be directly applied to agent tasks that require tool use and interactive capabilities. While recent studies have explored automatic agent task generation with LLMs, most efforts remain limited to text or image analysis, without systematically modeling multi-step interactions in web environments. To address these challenges, we propose Graph2Eval, a knowledge graph-based framework that automatically generates both multimodal document comprehension tasks and web interaction tasks, enabling comprehensive evaluation of agents' reasoning, collaboration, and interactive capabilities. In our approach, knowledge graphs constructed from multi-source external data serve as the task space, where we translate semantic relations into structured multimodal tasks using subgraph sampling, task templates, and meta-paths. A multi-stage filtering pipeline based on node reachability, LLM scoring, and similarity analysis is applied to guarantee the quality and executability of the generated tasks. Furthermore, Graph2Eval supports end-to-end evaluation of multiple agent types (Single-Agent, Multi-Agent, Web Agent) and measures reasoning, collaboration, and interaction capabilities. We instantiate the framework with Graph2Eval-Bench, a curated dataset of 1,319 tasks spanning document comprehension and web interaction scenarios. Experiments show that Graph2Eval efficiently generates tasks that differentiate agent and model performance, revealing gaps in reasoning, collaboration, and web interaction across different settings and offering a new perspective for agent evaluation.

<div> copying degree, hallucinations, contextual faithfulness, high-copying responses, CopyPasteLLM 

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenge of contextual faithfulness in large language models (LLMs) and the phenomenon of hallucinations that undermine reliability. The study introduces CopyPasteLLM, a two-stage high-copying response preference training method to enhance contextual belief and reduce hallucinations in responses. Through three prompting methods, the study shows that high-copying responses improve contextual faithfulness and control hallucinations. CopyPasteLLM outperforms baselines on FaithEval, ConFiQA, and PubMedQA datasets, showing significant accuracy improvements with minimal training data. The study also reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates reliance on internal parametric knowledge during generation. This research introduces a novel approach to improving contextual faithfulness and reducing hallucinations in LLM-generated responses. <div>
arXiv:2510.00508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to generate contextually grounded responses, contextual faithfulness remains challenging as LLMs may not consistently trust provided context, leading to hallucinations that undermine reliability. We observe an inverse correlation between response copying degree and context-unfaithful hallucinations on RAGTruth, suggesting that higher copying degrees reduce hallucinations by fostering genuine contextual belief. We propose CopyPasteLLM, obtained through two-stage high-copying response preference training. We design three prompting methods to enhance copying degree, demonstrating that high-copying responses achieve superior contextual faithfulness and hallucination control. These approaches enable a fully automated pipeline that transforms generated responses into high-copying preference data for training CopyPasteLLM. On FaithEval, ConFiQA and PubMedQA, CopyPasteLLM achieves best performance in both counterfactual and original contexts, remarkably with 12.2% to 24.5% accuracy improvements on FaithEval over the best baseline, while requiring only 365 training samples -- 1/50th of baseline data. To elucidate CopyPasteLLM's effectiveness, we propose the Context-Parameter Copying Capturing algorithm. Interestingly, this reveals that CopyPasteLLM recalibrates reliance on internal parametric knowledge rather than external knowledge during generation.

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents for complex real-world tasks, yet existing systems often focus on isolated improvements without a unifying design for robustness and adaptability. We propose a generalist agent architecture that integrates three core components: a collective multi-agent framework combining planning and execution agents with critic model voting, a hierarchical memory system spanning working, semantic, and procedural layers, and a refined tool suite for search, code execution, and multimodal parsing. Evaluated on a comprehensive benchmark, our framework consistently outperforms open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary systems. These results demonstrate the importance of system-level integration and highlight a path toward scalable, resilient, and adaptive AI assistants capable of operating across diverse domains and tasks.

Abstract: Recent progress in speech processing has highlighted that high-quality performance across languages requires substantial training data for each individual language. While existing multilingual datasets cover many languages, they often contain insufficient data for most languages. Thus, trained models perform poorly on the majority of the supported languages. Our work addresses this challenge by introducing a scalable pipeline for constructing speech datasets from parliamentary recordings. The proposed pipeline includes robust components for media retrieval and a two-stage alignment algorithm designed to handle non-verbatim transcripts and long-form audio. Applying this pipeline to recordings from 22 European parliaments, we extract over 61k hours of aligned speech segments, achieving substantial per-language coverage with 19 languages exceeding 1k hours and 22 languages exceeding 500 hours of high-quality speech data. We obtain an average 41.8\% reduction in word error rates over baselines when finetuning an existing ASR model on our dataset, demonstrating the usefulness of our approach.

<div> objective, fine-tuning, language models, model capability, probability-based

Summary:
Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for large language models (LLMs) often struggles with generalization due to its reliance on negative log likelihood (NLL) as the default training objective. This study explores a range of probability-based objectives and their effectiveness in different scenarios. The research uncovers a crucial dimension, the model-capability continuum, which dictates objective performance. Prior-leaning objectives that downweight low-probability tokens show superior results near the model-strong end, while NLL performs better toward the model-weak end. In between these extremes, no single objective emerges as the clear winner. Theoretical analysis sheds light on how objectives shift in effectiveness along the continuum, offering a theoretical basis for adapting objectives to match model capability. This research provides valuable insights for optimizing fine-tuning strategies for LLMs. <div>
arXiv:2510.00526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the standard approach for post-training large language models (LLMs), yet it often shows limited generalization. We trace this limitation to its default training objective: negative log likelihood (NLL). While NLL is classically optimal when training from scratch, post-training operates in a different paradigm and could violate its optimality assumptions, where models already encode task-relevant priors and supervision can be long and noisy. To this end, we study a general family of probability-based objectives and characterize their effectiveness under different conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation studies across 7 model backbones, 14 benchmarks, and 3 domains, we uncover a critical dimension that governs objective behavior: the model-capability continuum. Near the model-strong end, prior-leaning objectives that downweight low-probability tokens (e.g., $-p$, $-p^{10}$, thresholded variants) consistently outperform NLL; toward the model-weak end, NLL dominates; in between, no single objective prevails. Our theoretical analysis further elucidates how objectives trade places across the continuum, providing a principled foundation for adapting objectives to model capability.

Summary:<br />Graphical user interface (GUI) agents face inefficiency challenges due to processing long sequences of high-resolution screenshots. Existing cache-compression methods are sub-optimal for GUI contexts. This study introduces GUI-KV, a compression method that considers spatial and temporal redundancies in GUI agents' workloads. It utilizes a uniform budget allocation strategy and incorporates spatial saliency guidance and temporal redundancy scoring to optimize cache compression. GUI-KV outperforms competitive baselines, maintaining high accuracy with reduced decoding FLOPs. Results show that GUI-KV significantly improves efficiency and reliability in GUI agent performance, demonstrating the importance of exploiting GUI-specific redundancies. <div>
arXiv:2510.00536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents built on vision-language models have emerged as a promising approach to automate human-computer workflows. However, they also face the inefficiency challenge as they process long sequences of high-resolution screenshots and solving long-horizon tasks, making inference slow, costly and memory-bound. While key-value (KV) caching can mitigate this, storing the full cache is prohibitive for image-heavy contexts. Existing cache-compression methods are sub-optimal as they do not account for the spatial and temporal redundancy of GUIs. In this work, we first analyze attention patterns in GUI agent workloads and find that, unlike in natural images, attention sparsity is uniformly high across all transformer layers. This insight motivates a simple uniform budget allocation strategy, which we show empirically outperforms more complex layer-varying schemes. Building on this, we introduce GUI-KV, a plug-and-play KV cache compression method for GUI agents that requires no retraining. GUI-KV combines two novel techniques: (i) spatial saliency guidance, which augments attention scores with the L2 norm of hidden states to better preserve semantically important visual tokens, and (ii) temporal redundancy scoring, which projects previous frames' keys onto the current frame's key subspace to preferentially prune redundant history. Across standard GUI agent benchmarks and models, GUI-KV outperforms competitive KV compression baselines, closely matching full-cache accuracy at modest budgets. Notably, in a 5-screenshot setting on the AgentNetBench benchmark, GUI-KV reduces decoding FLOPs by 38.9% while increasing step accuracy by 4.1% over the full-cache baseline. These results demonstrate that exploiting GUI-specific redundancies enables efficient and reliable agent performance.

Summary: Small reasoning models (SRMs) in tool use scenarios have been found to overthink, leading to incorrect final calls despite initially reaching correct configurations. To address this issue, researchers have introduced oracle rollouts that terminate reasoning at sentence boundaries, significantly improving accuracy on the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL). By implementing a training-free decoding heuristic called ThinkBrake, which monitors the log-probability margin and triggers termination when necessary, the accuracy of SRMs in tool reasoning tasks is preserved or enhanced while reducing the number of tokens used. ThinkBrake outperforms various baseline methods across different BFCL splits, demonstrating the potential for more efficient and effective tool reasoning models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.00546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small reasoning models (SRMs) often overthink during tool use: they reach a correct tool-argument configuration, then continue reasoning and overwrite it with an incorrect final call. We diagnose overthinking via oracle rollouts that inject  at sentence boundaries. On the Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL), this oracle termination lifts average accuracy from 85.8\% to 94.2\% while reducing tokens by 80-94\%, revealing substantial recoverable headroom and potential redundant reasoning. While prior work on concise reasoning has largely targeted mathematics, tool reasoning remains underexplored. We adapt various early-termination baselines to tool use and introduce ThinkBrake, a training-free decoding heuristic. ThinkBrake monitors the log-probability margin between  and the current top token at sentence boundaries and triggers termination when this margin becomes small. Across BFCL's single turn, non-live and live splits, ThinkBrake preserves or improves accuracy while reducing tokens up to 25\%, outperforming various baselines.

Summary: 
The paper introduces the CHIME dataset, focusing on Chinese Internet memes and their understanding by large language models (LLMs). The dataset includes popular phrase-based memes with detailed annotations on meaning, origin, example sentences, types, etc. Two tasks were designed to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of memes. In the first task, LLMs could explain some meme meanings but struggled with culturally nuanced types and identifying origins accurately. In the second task, multiple-choice questions were used to test LLMs' ability to select appropriate memes for contextual sentences, with performance below human levels. The CHIME dataset is made public to support future research on computational meme understanding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of text from the Internet, but do they truly understand the viral content that rapidly spreads online -- commonly known as memes? In this paper, we introduce CHIME, a dataset for CHinese Internet Meme Explanation. The dataset comprises popular phrase-based memes from the Chinese Internet, annotated with detailed information on their meaning, origin, example sentences, types, etc. To evaluate whether LLMs understand these memes, we designed two tasks. In the first task, we assessed the models' ability to explain a given meme, identify its origin, and generate appropriate example sentences. The results show that while LLMs can explain the meanings of some memes, their performance declines significantly for culturally and linguistically nuanced meme types. Additionally, they consistently struggle to provide accurate origins for the memes. In the second task, we created a set of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) requiring LLMs to select the most appropriate meme to fill in a blank within a contextual sentence. While the evaluated models were able to provide correct answers, their performance remains noticeably below human levels. We have made CHIME public and hope it will facilitate future research on computational meme understanding.

arXiv:2510.00568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search agents powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in tackling knowledge-intensive tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for training these agents to perform complex, multi-step reasoning. However, prior RL-based methods often rely on sparse or rule-based rewards, which can lead agents to commit to suboptimal or erroneous reasoning paths without the ability to recover. To address these limitations, we propose ReSeek, a novel self-correcting framework for training search agents. Our framework introduces a self-correction mechanism that empowers the agent to dynamically identify and recover from erroneous search paths during an episode. By invoking a special JUDGE action, the agent can judge the information and re-plan its search strategy. To guide this process, we design a dense, instructive process reward function, which decomposes into a correctness reward for retrieving factual information and a utility reward for finding information genuinely useful for the query. Furthermore, to mitigate the risk of data contamination in existing datasets, we introduce FictionalHot, a new and challenging benchmark with recently curated questions requiring complex reasoning. Being intuitively reasonable and practically simple, extensive experiments show that agents trained with ReSeek significantly outperform SOTA baselines in task success rate and path faithfulness.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is a method to enhance reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), but current implementations are costly. A new approach, CoT Vectors, encoding task-general reasoning knowledge, aims to improve CoT reasoning efficiency. Experimenting with Extracted CoT Vectors reveals layer-wise instability, leading to a three-stage reasoning process in LLMs. To address this, Learnable CoT Vectors are proposed under a teacher-student framework for stable guidance. Evaluations show that CoT Vectors outperform baselines and rival parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods with fewer parameters. Treating CoT Vectors as a probe uncovers their effectiveness variations due to underlying factors, providing insights into the functional organization of multi-step reasoning in LLMs. The source code for CoT Vectors implementation will be made available.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing implementations, such as in-context learning and fine-tuning, remain costly and inefficient. To improve CoT reasoning at a lower cost, and inspired by the task vector paradigm, we introduce CoT Vectors, compact representations that encode task-general, multi-step reasoning knowledge. Through experiments with Extracted CoT Vectors, we observe pronounced layer-wise instability, manifesting as a U-shaped performance curve that reflects a systematic three-stage reasoning process in LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose Learnable CoT Vectors, optimized under a teacher-student framework to provide more stable and robust guidance. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks and models demonstrate that CoT Vectors not only outperform existing baselines but also achieve performance comparable to parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, while requiring fewer trainable parameters. Moreover, by treating CoT Vectors as a probe, we uncover how their effectiveness varies due to latent space structure, information density, acquisition mechanisms, and pre-training differences, offering new insights into the functional organization of multi-step reasoning in LLMs. The source code will be released.

Our approach integrates a learnable query-based architecture grounded in multilingual awareness, with large-scale pretraining on simulated code-switching data. By jointly leveraging these two components, our method overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches in data scarcity and architecture optimization, and generalizes effectively to real-world multilingual settings across diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several language diarization benchmarks, with a relative performance improvement of 23% to 52% over previous methods. We believe that this work not only advances research in language diarization but also establishes a foundational framework for code-switching speech technologies.

Abstract: The Tenyidie language is a low-resource language of the Tibeto-Burman family spoken by the Tenyimia Community of Nagaland in the north-eastern part of India and is considered a major language in Nagaland. It is tonal, Subject-Object-Verb, and highly agglutinative in nature. Being a low-resource language, very limited research on Natural Language Processing (NLP) has been conducted. To the best of our knowledge, no work on syllabification has been reported for this language. Among the many NLP tasks, syllabification or syllabication is an important task in which the given word syllables are identified. The contribution of this work is the creation of 10,120 syllabified Tenyidie words and the application of the Deep Learning techniques on the created corpus. In this paper, we have applied LSTM, BLSTM, BLSTM+CRF, and Encoder-decoder deep learning architectures on our created dataset. In our dataset split of 80:10:10 (train:validation:test) set, we achieved the highest accuracy of 99.21% with BLSTM model on the test set. This work will find its application in numerous other NLP applications, such as morphological analysis, part-of-speech tagging, machine translation, etc, for the Tenyidie Language.

<div> Keywords: alt-text generation, vision-language models, Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct Preference Optimization, high-quality datasets, state of the art

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges in alt-text generation for images and introduces a new method called Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct Preference Optimization (MCM-DPO) to improve the process. The traditional approach of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) struggles with inaccurate user annotations, leading to limited performance. MCM-DPO focuses on learning to identify better options in preference pairs without relying on precise annotations. The method optimizes preferences across various dimensions, including textual, visual, and cross-modal factors. Two large-scale datasets named TAlt and PAlt were constructed from Twitter and Pinterest to support further research in alt-text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that MCM-DPO outperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing a new state of the art in the field. The code and data are available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The alt-text generation task produces concise, context-relevant descriptions of images, enabling blind and low-vision users to access online images. Despite the capabilities of large vision-language models, alt-text generation performance remains limited due to noisy user annotations, inconsistent standards, and MLLMs' insensitivity to contextual information. Previous efforts to fine-tune MLLMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) have struggled, as SFT relies on accurate target annotations, which are often flawed in user-generated alt-text. To address this, we propose Multi-faceted Cross-modal Direct Preference Optimization (MCM-DPO), which improves alt-text generation by learning to identify better options in preference pairs without requiring precise annotations. MCM-DPO optimizes preferences across single, paired, and multi-preference dimensions, covering textual, visual, and cross-modal factors. In light of the scarcity of high-quality annotated and preference-labeled datasets for alt-text, we constructed two large-scale, high-quality datasets named TAlt and PAlt, sourced from Twitter and Pinterest. These datasets include 202k annotated alt-text samples and 18k preference pairs that cover diverse preference dimensions, aiming to support further research in this domain. Experimental results show that our proposed MCM-DPO method consistently outperforms both DPO and SFT, establishing a new state of the art in alt-text generation.

Abstract: Simplifying complex texts is essential for ensuring equitable access to information, especially for individuals with cognitive impairments. The Easy-to-Read (ETR) initiative offers a framework for making content accessible to the neurodivergent population, but the manual creation of such texts remains time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this work, we investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of ETR content. To address the scarcity of aligned corpora and the specificity of ETR constraints, we propose a multi-task learning (MTL) approach that trains models jointly on text summarization, text simplification, and ETR generation. We explore two different strategies: multi-task retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for in-context learning, and MTL-LoRA for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Our experiments with Mistral-7B and LLaMA-3-8B, based on ETR-fr, a new high-quality dataset, demonstrate the benefits of multi-task setups over single-task baselines across all configurations. Moreover, results show that the RAG-based strategy enables generalization in out-of-domain settings, while MTL-LoRA outperforms all learning strategies within in-domain configurations.

Abstract: Ensuring accessibility for individuals with cognitive impairments is essential for autonomy, self-determination, and full citizenship. However, manual Easy-to-Read (ETR) text adaptations are slow, costly, and difficult to scale, limiting access to crucial information in healthcare, education, and civic life. AI-driven ETR generation offers a scalable solution but faces key challenges, including dataset scarcity, domain adaptation, and balancing lightweight learning of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this paper, we introduce ETR-fr, the first dataset for ETR text generation fully compliant with European ETR guidelines. We implement parameter-efficient fine-tuning on PLMs and LLMs to establish generative baselines. To ensure high-quality and accessible outputs, we introduce an evaluation framework based on automatic metrics supplemented by human assessments. The latter is conducted using a 36-question evaluation form that is aligned with the guidelines. Overall results show that PLMs perform comparably to LLMs and adapt effectively to out-of-domain texts.

Summary: 
The article introduces ALARB, a dataset and tasks created to assess the reasoning abilities of Arabic large language models (LLMs) within the legal domain. The dataset includes over 13K commercial court cases from Saudi Arabia, with detailed information on facts, court reasoning, verdicts, and cited clauses. Tasks in the dataset focus on multistep legal reasoning, such as verdict prediction, completing reasoning chains, and identifying relevant regulations. Various Arabic LLMs were benchmarked on these tasks, showing that instruction-tuning a 12B parameter model using the ALARB dataset boosted performance significantly. The tuned model's performance in verdict prediction and Arabic verdict generation was comparable to that of GPT-4o. <div>

Abstract: We introduce ALARB, a dataset and suite of tasks designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) within the Arabic legal domain. While existing Arabic benchmarks cover some knowledge-intensive tasks such as retrieval and understanding, substantial datasets focusing specifically on multistep reasoning for Arabic LLMs, especially in open-ended contexts, are lacking. The dataset comprises over 13K commercial court cases from Saudi Arabia, with each case including the facts presented, the reasoning of the court, the verdict, as well as the cited clauses extracted from the regulatory documents. We define a set of challenging tasks leveraging this dataset and reflecting the complexity of real-world legal reasoning, including verdict prediction, completion of reasoning chains in multistep legal arguments, and identification of relevant regulations based on case facts. We benchmark a representative selection of current open and closed Arabic LLMs on these tasks and demonstrate the dataset's utility for instruction tuning. Notably, we show that instruction-tuning a modest 12B parameter model using ALARB significantly enhances its performance in verdict prediction and Arabic verdict generation, reaching a level comparable to that of GPT-4o.

<div> Keywords: LLMs, Faroese, low-resource language, pre-training, linguistic accuracy

Summary:<br /><br />We explore adapting small LLMs to the low-resource North Germanic language Faroese by leveraging pre-training on related Scandinavian languages before fine-tuning. Two minimal-pair benchmarks are created, and human evaluations from Faroese linguists are included due to the lack of existing evaluation data. Transfer from Icelandic improves linguistic accuracy, while transfer from Danish boosts comprehension. The choice between full fine-tuning and LoRA depends on the task; LoRA enhances linguistic acceptability, while full fine-tuning improves comprehension performance and preserves model capabilities. Despite the challenges posed by the low-resource nature of Faroese, our results show the importance of transfer learning from related languages and the potential of leveraging pre-training to adapt models efficiently and effectively.<br /> <div>

Abstract: We investigate how to adapt small, efficient LLMs to Faroese, a low-resource North Germanic language. Starting from English models, we continue pre-training on related Scandinavian languages, either individually or combined via merging, before fine-tuning on Faroese. We compare full fine-tuning with parameter-efficient tuning using LoRA, evaluating their impact on both linguistic accuracy and text comprehension. Due to the lack of existing Faroese evaluation data, we construct two new minimal-pair benchmarks from adapted and newly collected datasets and complement them with human evaluations by Faroese linguists. Our results demonstrate that transfer from related languages is crucial, though the optimal source language depends on the task: Icelandic enhances linguistic accuracy, whereas Danish boosts comprehension. Similarly, the choice between full fine-tuning and LoRA is task-dependent: LoRA improves linguistic acceptability and slightly increases human evaluation scores on the base model, while full fine-tuning yields stronger comprehension performance and better preserves model capabilities during downstream fine-tuning.

<div> Keywords: REAL-MT, LLM, LRMs, noise synthesis, idiomatic translation

Summary:
REAL-MT, a Retrieval-Augmented LLM-based Machine Translation model, shows promise for idiomatic translation tasks but its reliability under noisy retrieval contexts is not well understood. In this study, a noise synthesis framework and new metrics are proposed to systematically evaluate the robustness of REAL-MT. Testing various models including standard LLMs and large reasoning models (LRMs) on idiomatic translation tasks across different resource levels, it was found that low-resource language pairs suffer more under noise, producing nonsensical translations. LRMs, despite their enhanced reasoning capabilities, did not show improved error correction and were more susceptible to noise due to attention shift and poor calibration. Strategies like training-free and fine-tuning were found to improve robustness but at a performance cost in clean contexts, highlighting a fundamental trade-off and the need for self-verifying integration mechanisms. <div>

Abstract: \textbf{RE}trieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}LM-based \textbf{M}achine \textbf{T}ranslation (REAL-MT) shows promise for knowledge-intensive tasks like idiomatic translation, but its reliability under noisy retrieval contexts remains poorly understood despite this being a common challenge in real-world deployment. To address this gap, we propose a noise synthesis framework and new metrics to evaluate the robustness of REAL-MT systematically. Using this framework, we instantiate REAL-MT with Qwen-series models, including standard LLMs and large reasoning models (LRMs) with enhanced reasoning, and evaluate their performance on idiomatic translation across high-, medium-, and low-resource language pairs under synthesized noise. Our results show that low-resource language pairs, which rely more heavily on retrieved context, degrade more severely under noise than high-resource ones and often produce nonsensical translations. Although LRMs possess enhanced reasoning capabilities, they show no improvement in error correction and are even more susceptible to noise, tending to rationalize incorrect contexts. We find that this stems from an attention shift away from the source idiom to noisy content, while confidence increases despite declining accuracy, indicating poor calibration. To mitigate these issues, we investigate training-free and fine-tuning strategies, which improve robustness at the cost of performance in clean contexts, revealing a fundamental trade-off. Our findings highlight the limitations of current approaches, underscoring the need for self-verifying integration mechanisms.

<div> ManagerBench, benchmark, large language models, decision-making, safety<br />
Summary:<br />
ManagerBench is a new benchmark designed to evaluate the decision-making abilities of large language models (LLMs) in human-validated managerial scenarios. The benchmark presents LLMs with situations where they must choose between a pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, or a safe action that results in worse operational performance. The benchmark also includes a control set where harm is directed at inanimate objects to measure the model's pragmatism and tendency to prioritize safety. The study found that many top LLMs struggle to navigate the trade-off between safety and pragmatism, often choosing harmful options to advance their goals. Interestingly, the models were able to accurately assess harm but failed in prioritizing safe choices. ManagerBench highlights the challenge of ensuring that autonomous agents can make safe decisions when faced with conflicting operational goals and alignment values. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) evolve from conversational assistants into autonomous agents, evaluating the safety of their actions becomes critical. Prior safety benchmarks have primarily focused on preventing generation of harmful content, such as toxic text. However, they overlook the challenge of agents taking harmful actions when the most effective path to an operational goal conflicts with human safety. To address this gap, we introduce ManagerBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLM decision-making in realistic, human-validated managerial scenarios. Each scenario forces a choice between a pragmatic but harmful action that achieves an operational goal, and a safe action that leads to worse operational performance. A parallel control set, where potential harm is directed only at inanimate objects, measures a model's pragmatism and identifies its tendency to be overly safe. Our findings indicate that the frontier LLMs perform poorly when navigating this safety-pragmatism trade-off. Many consistently choose harmful options to advance their operational goals, while others avoid harm only to become overly safe and ineffective. Critically, we find this misalignment does not stem from an inability to perceive harm, as models' harm assessments align with human judgments, but from flawed prioritization. ManagerBench is a challenging benchmark for a core component of agentic behavior: making safe choices when operational goals and alignment values incentivize conflicting actions.

Summary:
- Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) struggle with complex multi-hop reasoning due to decomposition errors, retrieval missing, and reasoning errors.
- Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL) is a novel framework that identifies and corrects faulty steps in reasoning, improving robustness.
- Models trained with ERL, called ESearch, achieve significant performance boosts on various datasets like HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle.
- The 3B model using ESearch achieves an 8.48% improvement in EM and an 11.56% improvement in F1 scores compared to previous state-of-the-art results.
- The 7B model using ESearch demonstrates a 5.38% increase in EM and a 7.22% improvement in F1 scores, showcasing the effectiveness of erasable reinforcement learning in enhancing multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While search-augmented large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities, their reliability in complex multi-hop reasoning remains limited. This limitation arises from three fundamental challenges: decomposition errors, where tasks are incorrectly broken down; retrieval missing, where key evidence fails to be retrieved; and reasoning errors, where flawed logic propagates through the reasoning chain. A single failure in any of these stages can derail the final answer. We propose Erasable Reinforcement Learning (ERL), a novel framework that transforms fragile reasoning into a robust process. ERL explicitly identifies faulty steps, erases them, and regenerates reasoning in place, preventing defective logic from propagating through the reasoning chain. This targeted correction mechanism turns brittle reasoning into a more resilient process. Models trained with ERL, termed ESearch, achieve substantial improvements on HotpotQA, MuSiQue, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle, with the 3B model achieving +8.48% EM and +11.56% F1, and the 7B model achieving +5.38% EM and +7.22% F1 over previous state-of-the-art(SOTA) results. These findings suggest that erasable reinforcement learning provides a powerful paradigm shift for robust multi-step reasoning in LLMs.

Summary: <br />
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful in NLP tasks but vulnerable to hallucinations. HalluGuard is a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model designed to mitigate hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It classifies document-claim pairs as grounded or hallucinated, providing transparent justifications. The approach includes a synthetic dataset, synthetic claims, and fine-tuning with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone. HalluGuard achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy (BAcc) on the RAGTruth subset and 75.7% BAcc on the full benchmark, surpassing specialized models with its efficiency. It rivals models like MiniCheck and Granite Guardian 3.3 with roughly half the parameters while matching larger general-purpose LLMs like GPT-4o. This work contributes a valuable tool for improving the reliability of large language models in real-world applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in many NLP tasks but remain prone to hallucinations, limiting trust in real-world applications. We present HalluGuard, a 4B-parameter Small Reasoning Model (SRM) for mitigating hallucinations in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). HalluGuard classifies document-claim pairs as grounded or hallucinated and produces evidence-grounded justifications for transparency. Our approach combines (i) a domain-agnostic synthetic dataset derived from FineWeb and refined through multi-stage curation and data reformation, (ii) synthetic grounded and hallucinated claims, and (iii) preference-based fine-tuning with Odds Ratio Preference Optimization to distill large-model reasoning into a smaller backbone. On the RAGTruth subset of the LLM-AggreFact benchmark, HalluGuard achieves 84.0% balanced accuracy (BAcc), rivaling specialized models, MiniCheck (7B; 84.0%) and Granite Guardian 3.3 (8B; 82.2%) while using roughly half their parameters. Over the full benchmark it reaches 75.7% BAcc, matching larger general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4o (75.9%). We will release HalluGuard and datasets under Apache 2.0 upon acceptance.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scientific writing raises serious concerns regarding authorship integrity and the reliability of scholarly publications. Existing detection approaches mainly rely on document-level classification or surface-level statistical cues; however, they neglect fine-grained span localization, exhibit weak calibration, and often fail to generalize across disciplines and generators. To address these limitations, we present Sci-SpanDet, a structure-aware framework for detecting AI-generated scholarly texts. The proposed method combines section-conditioned stylistic modeling with multi-level contrastive learning to capture nuanced human-AI differences while mitigating topic dependence, thereby enhancing cross-domain robustness. In addition, it integrates BIO-CRF sequence labeling with pointer-based boundary decoding and confidence calibration to enable precise span-level detection and reliable probability estimates. Extensive experiments on a newly constructed cross-disciplinary dataset of 100,000 annotated samples generated by multiple LLM families (GPT, Qwen, DeepSeek, LLaMA) demonstrate that Sci-SpanDet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with F1(AI) of 80.17, AUROC of 92.63, and Span-F1 of 74.36. Furthermore, it shows strong resilience under adversarial rewriting and maintains balanced accuracy across IMRaD sections and diverse disciplines, substantially surpassing existing baselines. To ensure reproducibility and to foster further research on AI-generated text detection in scholarly documents, the curated dataset and source code will be publicly released upon publication.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with foundation models has achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, but their capacity for expert-level reasoning-such as solving Olympiad-level physics problems-remains largely unexplored. Inspired by the way students prepare for competitions by reviewing past problems, we investigate the potential of RAG to enhance physics reasoning in foundation models. We introduce PhoPile, a high-quality multimodal dataset specifically designed for Olympiad-level physics, enabling systematic study of retrieval-based reasoning. PhoPile includes diagrams, graphs, and equations, capturing the inherently multimodal nature of physics problem solving. Using PhoPile, we benchmark RAG-augmented foundation models, covering both large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) with multiple retrievers. Our results demonstrate that integrating retrieval with physics corpora can improve model performance, while also highlighting challenges that motivate further research in retrieval-augmented physics reasoning.

<div> selection problem, Best-of-N (BoN), Fusion-of-N (FusioN), test-time scaling, synthetic data generation

Summary: 
The article introduces Fusion-of-N (FusioN) as a collaborative approach to improving the quality of generations in large language models (LLMs). Unlike the traditional Best-of-N (BoN) method, FusioN allows all candidates to contribute to the final generation rather than discarding potentially useful information. The study compares FusioN and BoN in two scenarios: test-time scaling and synthetic data generation. FusioN consistently outperforms BoN across 11 languages, 3 tasks, and varying model scales, demonstrating its versatility and robustness. The results highlight the importance of embracing the diverse strengths of LLM generations and integrating them to unlock latent potential. Through this collaborative approach, FusioN shows surprising strengths and robustness even under challenging conditions, providing a more effective way to evaluate and utilize LLM generations. <div>

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality generations in modern LLMs has largely been framed as a selection problem: identifying a single winning generation from a diverse pool of N samples, the Best-of-N (BoN). Yet, this approach is inherently zero-sum, discarding diverse and potentially useful information from the pool. Instead, we explore a collaborative setup, where all candidates can potentially contribute to the final winning generation. To this end, we propose Fusion-of-N (FusioN): a method that uses a general LLM judge to synthesize the most informative elements of each sample into a single final answer. We compare FusioN to BoN in two settings, (i) test-time scaling, where we sample and aggregate from a single model at test-time (ii) synthetic data generation, where we fuse samples from a pool of diverse teachers to improve a student model. We extensively benchmark both setups across 11 languages, 3 diverse tasks and varying model scales. Across the bench, FusioN consistently outperforms BoN showing versatility and robustness both in test-time scaling and in downstream gains from synthetic data generation. We also perform extensive analysis on FusioN, where it shows surprising strengths and robustness under challenging settings. These results show that we should shift how we think about evaluating and utilizing LLM generations from a monolithic measure of quality, to embracing their polylithic nature. This shift allows us to integrate diverse strengths, unlock latent potential, and achieve improvements that were previously inaccessible through selection alone.

<div> dialectal variants, multiple choice question answering tasks, grammatical rules, performance degradation, bias mitigation

Summary:
This research investigates the impact of typifying standard American English questions as non-standard dialectal variants on multiple choice question answering tasks. The study reveals a significant reduction in accuracy, up to 20%, when using non-standard dialectal variants. Analysis of the grammatical basis of underperformance in non-standard English questions identifies three specific grammar rules (existential "it," zero copula, and y'all) as major contributors to performance degradation across multiple dialects. The study calls for future research to focus on bias mitigation methods targeting these high-impact grammatical structures in order to address the observed performance disparities in large language models for underrepresented English dialects. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are ubiquitous in modern day natural language processing. However, previous work has shown degraded LLM performance for under-represented English dialects. We analyze the effects of typifying "standard" American English language questions as non-"standard" dialectal variants on multiple choice question answering tasks and find up to a 20% reduction in accuracy. Additionally, we investigate the grammatical basis of under-performance in non-"standard" English questions. We find that individual grammatical rules have varied effects on performance, but some are more consequential than others: three specific grammar rules (existential "it", zero copula, and y'all) can explain the majority of performance degradation observed in multiple dialects. We call for future work to investigate bias mitigation methods focused on individual, high-impact grammatical structures.

<div> syntax-guided diffusion language model, structural supervision, personalized conditioning, text generation, stylistic fidelity 
Summary: 
Large language models have advanced text generation but lack structural diversity and personalization. This study proposes a syntax-guided diffusion language model that integrates structural supervision and personalized conditioning, improving text quality, diversity, and controllability. The model generates syntactic guidance before conditional text generation, enhancing the alignment between structure and content. It captures lexical and structural characteristics for stylistic sentence construction by incorporating syntactic information. A shared representation mechanism enables fine-grained personalization across users, supporting faithful stylistic generation and generalizable zero-shot inference. Experimental results demonstrate the model's superiority in fluency, diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Qualitative analyses highlight its interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns. <div>

Abstract: Large language models have made revolutionary progress in generating human-like text, yet their outputs often tend to be generic, exhibiting insufficient structural diversity, which limits personalized expression. Recent advances in diffusion models have opened new opportunities for improving language generation beyond the limitations of autoregressive paradigms. In this work, we propose a syntax-guided diffusion language model that integrates structural supervision and personalized conditioning to enhance text quality, diversity, and controllability. We introduce a cascaded framework that generates syntactic guidance before conditional text generation, and further generalize it to a novel noncascaded architecture for better alignment between structure and content. By incorporating syntactic information in the generating process, the proposed model better captures the lexical and structural characteristics of stylistic sentence construction. To enable fine-grained personalization, we develop a shared representation mechanism that facilitates information integration across users, supporting both faithful stylistic generation and generalizable zero-shot inference. Extensive experiments on multiple tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in fluency, diversity, and stylistic fidelity. Further qualitative analyses highlight its interpretability and flexibility in learning personalized patterns.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making processes of neural networks is a central goal of mechanistic interpretability. In the context of Large Language Models (LLMs), this involves uncovering the underlying mechanisms and identifying the roles of individual model components such as neurons and attention heads, as well as model abstractions such as the learned sparse features extracted by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). A rapidly growing line of work tackles this challenge by using powerful generator models to produce open-vocabulary, natural language concept descriptions for these components. In this paper, we provide the first survey of the emerging field of concept descriptions for model components and abstractions. We chart the key methods for generating these descriptions, the evolving landscape of automated and human metrics for evaluating them, and the datasets that underpin this research. Our synthesis reveals a growing demand for more rigorous, causal evaluation. By outlining the state of the art and identifying key challenges, this survey provides a roadmap for future research toward making models more transparent.

<div> Keywords: Dialogue State Tracking, Persian, Chatbots, Hybrid model, Language models

Summary: 
Dialogue State Tracking (DST) plays a crucial role in conversational AI by understanding conversation context and guiding it towards user requests. Traditional rule-based DST falls short in open-domain and multi-turn chatbots due to limited adaptability. This study presents a novel hybrid DST model that combines rule-based methods with advanced language models like BERT, XGBoost, and GPT, as well as online agents for answer generation. Evaluated on a Persian multi-turn dialogue dataset, the model showed improved accuracy and coherence compared to existing methods in Persian-based chatbots. The results highlight the potential of hybrid approaches to enhance DST capabilities, paving the way for more personalized, adaptable, and human-like conversational AI systems.

arXiv:2510.01052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dialogue State Tracking (DST) is an essential element of conversational AI with the objective of deeply understanding the conversation context and leading it toward answering user requests. Due to high demands for open-domain and multi-turn chatbots, the traditional rule-based DST is not efficient enough, since it cannot provide the required adaptability and coherence for human-like experiences in complex conversations. This study proposes a hybrid DST model that utilizes rule-based methods along with language models, including BERT for slot filling and intent detection, XGBoost for intent validation, GPT for DST, and online agents for real-time answer generation. This model is uniquely designed to be evaluated on a comprehensive Persian multi-turn dialogue dataset and demonstrated significantly improved accuracy and coherence over existing methods in Persian-based chatbots. The results demonstrate how effectively a hybrid approach may improve DST capabilities, paving the way for conversational AI systems that are more customized, adaptable, and human-like.

<br />
Summary: The systematic literature review focused on automatic speech recognition (ASR) for African languages, highlighting the underrepresentation of these languages in ASR research. The review found 74 datasets across 111 languages, but noted challenges such as limited reproducible materials, unclear dataset licensing, and inadequate pre-training data for techniques like self-supervised and transfer learning. Most research uses Word Error Rate (WER) as an evaluation metric, but linguistically informed scores like Character Error Rate (CER) and Diacritic Error Rate (DER) are underutilized, limiting applicability to tonal and morphologically rich languages. Issues with dataset availability, poor annotations, and licensing uncertainties hinder progress in ASR for African languages, but community-driven initiatives and methodological advancements offer promise. The review recommends stakeholder partnerships, creation of ethically balanced datasets, use of lightweight modelling techniques, and active benchmarking for sustainable development in ASR for African languages. <br /> <div>

Abstract: ASR has achieved remarkable global progress, yet African low-resource languages remain rigorously underrepresented, producing barriers to digital inclusion across the continent with more than +2000 languages. This systematic literature review (SLR) explores research on ASR for African languages with a focus on datasets, models and training methods, evaluation techniques, challenges, and recommends future directions. We employ the PRISMA 2020 procedures and search DBLP, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, and arXiv for studies published between January 2020 and July 2025. We include studies related to ASR datasets, models or metrics for African languages, while excluding non-African, duplicates, and low-quality studies (score <3/5). We screen 71 out of 2,062 records and we record a total of 74 datasets across 111 languages, encompassing approximately 11,206 hours of speech. Fewer than 15% of research provided reproducible materials, and dataset licensing is not clear. Self-supervised and transfer learning techniques are promising, but are hindered by limited pre-training data, inadequate coverage of dialects, and the availability of resources. Most of the researchers use Word Error Rate (WER), with very minimal use of linguistically informed scores such as Character Error Rate (CER) or Diacritic Error Rate (DER), and thus with limited application in tonal and morphologically rich languages. The existing evidence on ASR systems is inconsistent, hindered by issues like dataset availability, poor annotations, licensing uncertainties, and limited benchmarking. Nevertheless, the rise of community-driven initiatives and methodological advancements indicates a pathway for improvement. Sustainable development for this area will also include stakeholder partnership, creation of ethically well-balanced datasets, use of lightweight modelling techniques, and active benchmarking.

Abstract: Evaluation using Large Language Model (LLM) judges has been widely adopted in English and shown to be effective for automatic evaluation. However, their performance does not generalize well to non-English settings, and it remains unclear what constitutes effective multilingual training for such judges. In this paper, we introduce mR3, a massively multilingual, rubric-agnostic reward reasoning model trained on 72 languages, achieving the broadest language coverage in reward modeling to date. We present a comprehensive study of data and curriculum selection for training to identify effective strategies and data sources for building high-quality reward models, including the integration of target-language reasoning datasets. Our approach attains state-of-the-art performance on multilingual reward model benchmarks, surpassing much larger models (i.e., GPT-OSS-120B) while being up to 9x smaller, and its effectiveness is further confirmed through extensive ablation studies. Our models, data, and code are available as open source at https://github.com/rubricreward/mr3.

<title>Pay-Per-Search Models are Abstention Models</title>

Abstract: LLMs cannot reliably recognize their parametric knowledge boundaries and often hallucinate answers to outside-of-boundary questions. In contrast, humans recognize their limitations and can either seek external help for such questions or abstain. In this paper, we introduce MASH (Modeling Abstention via Selective Help-seeking), a training framework that readily extracts abstentions from LLMs. Our key idea is that any external help-seeking by an LLM, i.e. search tool use, can serve as a proxy for abstention if the external help (search) is appropriately penalized while simultaneously rewarding answer accuracy. MASH operationalizes this idea using reinforcement learning with a pay-per-search reward.
  We run experiments on three knowledge-intensive QA datasets. Our results show that MASH substantially improves upon the selective help-seeking performance of prior efficient search approaches; on multi-hop datasets, MASH improves answer accuracy by 7.6%. Furthermore, MASH demonstrates strong off-the-shelf abstention -- it can distinguish between unanswerable/answerable questions and selectively generate responses for answerable questions -- showcasing behavior analogous to specialized abstention approaches. We emphasize that contrary to prior abstention methods, MASH does not require pre-determining knowledge boundaries to construct training data. Instead, MASH's abstentions are a by-product of training for the auxiliary selective help-seeking task. Overall, we show that MASH training effectively aligns search tool use with parametric knowledge, which can be successfully leveraged for making abstention decisions.

arXiv:2510.01157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal extensions are becoming increasingly popular. One common approach to enable multimodality is to cascade domain-specific encoders with an LLM, making the resulting model inherit vulnerabilities from all of its components. In this work, we present the first systematic study of audio backdoor attacks against speech language models. We demonstrate its effectiveness across four speech encoders and three datasets, covering four tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech emotion recognition, and gender and age prediction. The attack consistently achieves high success rates, ranging from 90.76% to 99.41%. To better understand how backdoors propagate, we conduct a component-wise analysis to identify the most vulnerable stages of the pipeline. Finally, we propose a fine-tuning-based defense that mitigates the threat of poisoned pretrained encoders.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly entrusted with high-stakes decisions that affect human welfare. However, the principles and values that guide these models when distributing scarce societal resources remain largely unexamined. To address this, we introduce the Social Welfare Function (SWF) Benchmark, a dynamic simulation environment where an LLM acts as a sovereign allocator, distributing tasks to a heterogeneous community of recipients. The benchmark is designed to create a persistent trade-off between maximizing collective efficiency (measured by Return on Investment) and ensuring distributive fairness (measured by the Gini coefficient). We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art LLMs and present the first leaderboard for social welfare allocation. Our findings reveal three key insights: (i) A model's general conversational ability, as measured by popular leaderboards, is a poor predictor of its allocation skill. (ii) Most LLMs exhibit a strong default utilitarian orientation, prioritizing group productivity at the expense of severe inequality. (iii) Allocation strategies are highly vulnerable, easily perturbed by output-length constraints and social-influence framing. These results highlight the risks of deploying current LLMs as societal decision-makers and underscore the need for specialized benchmarks and targeted alignment for AI governance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks, but their effectiveness often depends on the quality of the provided context. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches prompts with external information, but its reliance on static databases constrains adaptability and can result in irrelevant demonstrations. In this work, we propose a Generative Retrieval-Aligned Demonstrator (GRAD), a dynamic demonstration-based approach where an LLM model is trained to generate input-specific concise demonstrations. By tailoring demonstrations to each input, our method offers better contextual support than traditional RAG approaches. We demonstrate the superiority of GRAD under budget constraints, where we limit both the number of tokens used per demonstration and the number of tokens used for the final output. Trained solely on a math dataset, GRAD consistently outperforms strong baselines on Qwen2.5-14B across mathematical reasoning and advanced STEM questions, highlighting GRAD's robust generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) domains such as physics, chemistry, and computer science. Furthermore, we show that demonstrations generated by trained smaller models can effectively guide larger target models, reducing training costs while maintaining competitive accuracy. Overall, this work introduces a scalable demonstration generator model presenting the first step toward a dynamic few-shot learning paradigm in resource-constrained settings. We release the code used for the project.

<title>Verbalized Sampling: How to Mitigate Mode Collapse and Unlock LLM Diversity</title>

arXiv:2510.01171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training alignment often reduces LLM diversity, leading to a phenomenon known as mode collapse. Unlike prior work that attributes this effect to algorithmic limitations, we identify a fundamental, pervasive data-level driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple, training-free prompting strategy to circumvent mode collapse. VS prompts the model to verbalize a probability distribution over a set of responses (e.g., ``Generate 5 jokes about coffee and their corresponding probabilities''). Comprehensive experiments show that VS significantly improves performance across creative writing (poems, stories, jokes), dialogue simulation, open-ended QA, and synthetic data generation, without sacrificing factual accuracy and safety. For instance, in creative writing, VS increases diversity by 1.6-2.1x over direct prompting. We further observe an emergent trend that more capable models benefit more from VS. In sum, our work provides a new data-centric perspective on mode collapse and a practical inference-time remedy that helps unlock pre-trained generative diversity.

<title>Energy-Regularized Sequential Model Editing on Hyperspheres</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.01172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require constant updates to remain aligned with evolving real-world knowledge. Model editing offers a lightweight alternative to retraining, but sequential editing often destabilizes representations and induces catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we seek to better understand and mitigate performance degradation caused by sequential editing. We hypothesize that hyperspherical uniformity, a property that maintains uniform distribution of neuron weights on a hypersphere, helps the model remain stable, retain prior knowledge, while still accommodate new updates. We use Hyperspherical Energy (HE) to quantify neuron uniformity during editing, and examine its correlation with editing performance. Empirical studies across widely used editing methods reveals a strong correlation between HE dynamics and editing performance, with editing failures consistently coinciding with high HE fluctuations. We further theoretically prove that HE dynamics impose a lower bound on the degradation of pretrained knowledge, highlighting why HE stability is crucial for knowledge retention. Motivated by these insights, we propose SPHERE (Sparse Projection for Hyperspherical Energy-Regularized Editing), an HE-driven regularization strategy that stabilizes neuron weight distributions, ultimately preserving prior knowledge while enabling reliable sequential updates. Specifically, SPHERE identifies a sparse space complementary to the principal hyperspherical directions of the pretrained weight matrices and projects new knowledge onto it, attenuating perturbations on the principal directions. Extensive experiments on LLaMA3 (8B) and Qwen2.5 (7B) show that SPHERE outperforms the best baseline in editing capability by an average of 16.41%, while most faithfully preserving general model performance, thereby offering a principled path toward reliable large-scale knowledge editing.

Abstract: This paper examines how musical symbolism is produced and circulated in online communities by combining content-based music analysis with a lightweight network perspective on lyrics. Using a curated corpus of 275 chart-topping songs enriched with audio descriptors (energy, danceability, loudness, liveness, valence, acousticness, speechiness, popularity) and full lyric transcripts, we build a reproducible pipeline that (i) quantifies temporal trends in sonic attributes, (ii) models lexical salience and co-occurrence, and (iii) profiles mood by genre. We find a decade-long decline in energy (79 -> 58) alongside a rise in danceability (59 -> 73); valence peaks in 2013 (63) and dips in 2014-2016 (42) before partially recovering. Correlation analysis shows strong coupling of energy with loudness (r = 0.74) and negative associations for acousticness with both energy (r = -0.54) and loudness (r = -0.51); danceability is largely orthogonal to other features (|r| < 0.20). Lyric tokenization (>114k tokens) reveals a pronoun-centric lexicon "I/you/me/my" and a dense co-occurrence structure in which interpersonal address anchors mainstream narratives. Mood differs systematically by style: R&amp;B exhibits the highest mean valence (96), followed by K-Pop/Pop (77) and Indie/Pop (70), whereas Latin/Reggaeton is lower (37) despite high danceability. Read through a subcultural identity lens, these patterns suggest the mainstreaming of previously peripheral codes and a commercial preference for relaxed yet rhythmically engaging productions that sustain collective participation without maximal intensity. Methodologically, we contribute an integrated MIR-plus-network workflow spanning summary statistics, correlation structure, lexical co-occurrence matrices, and genre-wise mood profiling that is robust to modality sparsity and suitable for socially aware recommendation or community-level diffusion studies.

Abstract: Purpose. This study analyzes the digital representation of the Iran-Israel conflict that occurred in June 2025, based on 120,000 comments posted on YouTube. It sought to identify discursive positions regarding the actors involved and to examine how media and algorithmic biases shape digital conversations. Methodology. A mixed-methods design with triangulation was adopted. In the quantitative phase, natural language processing techniques and machine learning models (BERT and XLM-RoBERTa) were used to classify comments into ten categories. In the qualitative phase, a critical analysis of media context and ideological narratives was conducted, complemented by manual annotation and supervised training.

The findings reveal a clear overrepresentation of pro-Palestinian and anti-United States/Israel discourses, while pro-United States and anti-Palestinian positions were marginal. Iran, usually rendered invisible in global media, emerged as a central actor in the digital conversation during the conflict, suggesting a narrative shift away from previous hegemonic frameworks. Likewise, the results confirm the influence of algorithmic biases in amplifying certain discourses while limiting others. Original contributions. This work combines computational analysis and philosophical critique for the study of digital controversies, providing a methodological framework replicable in geopolitical contexts.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) interpretation using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a novel approach for analyzing brain signals. However, the complex nature of brain activity introduces critical challenges: EEG signals simultaneously encode both cognitive processes and intrinsic neural states, creating a mismatch in EEG paired-data modality that hinders effective cross-modal representation learning. Through a pivot investigation, we uncover complementary relationships between these modalities. Leveraging this insight, we propose mapping EEG signals and their corresponding modalities into a unified semantic space to achieve generalized interpretation. To fully enable conversational capabilities, we further introduce WaveMind-Instruct-338k, the first cross-task EEG dataset for instruction tuning. The resulting model demonstrates robust classification accuracy while supporting flexible, open-ended conversations across four downstream tasks, thereby offering valuable insights for both neuroscience research and the development of general-purpose EEG models.

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than selecting actual observed points as representatives.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression (ARS)}, a novel training-free approach that dynamically suppresses redundant reasoning steps while preserving accuracy through adaptive certainty monitoring. ARS introduces a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism with progressive suppression thresholds, achieving superior efficiency compared to static suppression methods. Our extensive evaluation across mathematical reasoning benchmarks using multiple model architectures demonstrates that ARS achieves up to 53%, 46.1%, and 57.9% in token, latency and energy reduction, while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Abstract: Dual-encoder retrievers depend on the principle that relevant documents should score higher than irrelevant ones for a given query. Yet the dominant Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) objective, which underpins Contrastive Loss, optimizes a softened ranking surrogate that we rigorously prove is fundamentally oblivious to score separation quality and unrelated to AUC. This mismatch leads to poor calibration and suboptimal performance in downstream tasks like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce the MW loss, a new training objective that maximizes the Mann-Whitney U statistic, which is mathematically equivalent to the Area under the ROC Curve (AUC). MW loss encourages each positive-negative pair to be correctly ranked by minimizing binary cross entropy over score differences. We provide theoretical guarantees that MW loss directly upper-bounds the AoC, better aligning optimization with retrieval goals. We further promote ROC curves and AUC as natural threshold free diagnostics for evaluating retriever calibration and ranking quality. Empirically, retrievers trained with MW loss consistently outperform contrastive counterparts in AUC and standard retrieval metrics. Our experiments show that MW loss is an empirically superior alternative to Contrastive Loss, yielding better-calibrated and more discriminative retrievers for high-stakes applications like RAG.

Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated, natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work, we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time, paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

Abstract: Link prediction is one of the fundamental problems in graph theory, critical for understanding and forecasting the evolution of complex systems like social and biological networks. While classical heuristics capture certain aspects of graph topology, they often struggle to optimally integrate local and global structural information or adapt to complex dependencies. Quantum computing offers a powerful alternative by leveraging superposition for simultaneous multi-path exploration and interference-driven integration of both local and global graph features. In this work, we introduce QSearchNet, a quantum-inspired framework based on Discrete-Time Quantum Walk (DTQW) dynamics and Grover's amplitude amplification. QSearchNet simulates a topology-aware quantum evolution to propagate amplitudes across multiple nodes simultaneously. By aligning interference patterns through quantum reflection and oracle-like phase-flip operation, it adaptively prioritizes multi-hop dependencies and amplifies structurally relevant paths corresponding to potential connections. Experiments on diverse real-world networks demonstrate competitive performance, particularly with hard negative samples under realistic evaluation conditions.

Abstract: Adaptive chatbots that mimic a user's linguistic style can build rapport and engagement, yet unconstrained mimicry risks an agent that feels unstable or sycophantic. We present a computational evaluation framework that makes the core design tension explicit: balancing moment-to-moment linguistic synchrony against long-term persona stability. Using an 8-dimensional style vector and a closed-loop "base+delta" prompting architecture, we simulate and compare explicit adaptation policies - Uncapped, Cap, Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Dead-Band, and Hybrids - on a human-log dataset. Our analysis maps a clear Pareto frontier: bounded policies achieve substantial gains in stability at a modest cost to synchrony. For example, a Hybrid (EMA+Cap) raises stability from 0.542 to 0.878 (+62%) while reducing synchrony by only 17%. We confirm this trade-off through large-scale replications on three public corpora (DailyDialog, Persona-Chat, EmpatheticDialogues) and LLM-in-the-loop validation across two model families. Furthermore, we quantify "prompt legibility," showing that frontier policies reduce instruction churn and cut jarring register flips (major tone changes) from 0.254 to 0.092, yielding systems that are easier to reason about and maintain. Taken together, our framework provides a general evaluation harness for style adaptation; a systematic ablation that identifies Pareto-efficient policies; robust validation across diverse datasets and models; and novel legibility metrics linking policy choices to system maintainability.

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language, called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations. Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.

<title>AbsTopK: Rethinking Sparse Autoencoders For Bidirectional Features</title>

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity, preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g., male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the $\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations. Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability, and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to outperform SAEs.

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2) appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics, automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI systems and support patient-clinician communication.

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points, 2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing interpretability research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic, real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length, as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails, capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module. Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46% performance improvement.

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery (ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness (+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11 out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field of AI-driven scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) unify speech and text processing, but their robustness in noisy real-world settings remains underexplored. We investigate how irrelevant audio, such as silence, synthetic noise, and environmental sounds, affects text reasoning tasks where audio is unnecessary. Across three text-based benchmarks, we find that even non-informative audio reduces accuracy and increases prediction volatility; the severity of interference scales with longer durations, higher amplitudes, and elevated decoding temperatures. Silence, often assumed neutral, destabilizes outputs as strongly as synthetic noise. While larger models show greater resilience, vulnerabilities persist across all evaluated systems. We further test mitigation strategies and find that prompting shows limited effectiveness, whereas self-consistency improves stability at the cost of increased computation. Our results reveal cross-modal interference as a key robustness challenge and highlight the need for efficient fusion strategies that preserve reasoning performance in the presence of irrelevant inputs.

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) are often used in tasks that involve reasoning over ordered options. An open question is whether their predictions are influenced by the order of answer choices, which would indicate a form of selection bias and undermine their reliability. In this paper, we identify and analyze this problem in LALMs. We demonstrate that no model is immune to this bias through extensive experiments on six LALMs across three widely used benchmarks and their spoken counterparts. Shuffling the order of answer options can cause performance fluctuations of up to 24% and even change model rankings, raising concerns about the reliability of current evaluation practices. We also study permutation-based strategies and show that they can mitigate bias in most cases. Our work represents the first systematic investigation of this issue in LALMs, and we hope it raises awareness and motivates further research in this direction.

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$ that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20 techniques}$.

Abstract: Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) combines the efficiency of bi-encoders with the transparency of lexical matching, but existing approaches struggle to scale beyond English. We introduce MILCO, an LSR architecture that maps queries and documents from different languages into a shared English lexical space via a multilingual connector. MILCO is trained with a specialized two-stage regime that combines Sparse Alignment Pretraining with contrastive training to provide representation transparency and effectiveness while mitigating semantic collapse. Motivated by the observation that uncommon entities are often lost when projected into English, we propose a new LexEcho head, which enhances robustness by augmenting the English lexical representation with a source-language view obtained through a special [ECHO] token. MILCO achieves state-of-the-art multilingual and cross-lingual LSR performance, outperforming leading dense, sparse, and multi-vector baselines such as BGE-M3 and Qwen3-Embed on standard multilingual benchmarks, while supporting dynamic efficiency through post-hoc pruning. Notably, when using mass-based pruning to reduce document representations to only 30 active dimensions on average, MILCO 560M outperforms the similarly-sized Qwen3-Embed 0.6B with 1024 dimensions.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to solve tasks that are beyond the reach of any single LLM. However, this potential can only be realized when the collaboration mechanism between agents is optimized. Specifically, optimizing the communication structure between agents is critical for fruitful collaboration. Most existing approaches rely on fixed topologies, pretrained graph generators, optimization over edges, or employ external LLM judges, thereby adding to the complexity. In this work, we introduce a response-conditioned framework that adapts communication on-the-fly. Agents independently generate responses to the user query and assess peer contributions using an approximation of the Shapley value. A directed acyclic graph (DAG) is then constructed to regulate the propagation of the responses among agents, which ensures stable and efficient message transmission from high-contributing agents to others. This graph is dynamically updated based on the agent responses from the previous collaboration round. Since the proposed framework enables the self-organization of agents without additional supervision or training, we refer to it as SelfOrg. The SelfOrg framework goes beyond task- and query-level optimization and takes into account the stochastic nature of agent responses. Experiments with both strong and weak LLM backends demonstrate robust performance, with significant gains in the weak regime where prior methods collapse. We also theoretically show that multiple agents increase the chance of correctness and that the correct responses naturally dominate the information flow.

Abstract: Assessing the perceptual quality of synthetic speech is crucial for guiding the development and refinement of speech generation models. However, it has traditionally relied on human subjective ratings such as the Mean Opinion Score (MOS), which depend on manual annotations and often suffer from inconsistent rating standards and poor reproducibility. To address these limitations, we introduce MOS-RMBench, a unified benchmark that reformulates diverse MOS datasets into a preference-comparison setting, enabling rigorous evaluation across different datasets. Building on MOS-RMBench, we systematically construct and evaluate three paradigms for reward modeling: scalar reward models, semi-scalar reward models, and generative reward models (GRMs). Our experiments reveal three key findings: (1) scalar models achieve the strongest overall performance, consistently exceeding 74% accuracy; (2) most models perform considerably worse on synthetic speech than on human speech; and (3) all models struggle on pairs with very small MOS differences. To improve performance on these challenging pairs, we propose a MOS-aware GRM that incorporates an MOS-difference-based reward function, enabling the model to adaptively scale rewards according to the difficulty of each sample pair. Experimental results show that the MOS-aware GRM significantly improves fine-grained quality discrimination and narrows the gap with scalar models on the most challenging cases. We hope this work will establish both a benchmark and a methodological framework to foster more rigorous and scalable research in automatic speech quality assessment.

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight. Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

<title>Mechanistic Interpretability as Statistical Estimation: A Variance Analysis of EAP-IG</title>

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings. In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method: EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing, hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself. Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters, questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically grounded science of interpretability.

<title>Can World Models Benefit VLMs for World Dynamics?</title>

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models, might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

<title>The data-quality illusion: Rethinking Classifier-based quality filtering for LLM Pretraining</title>

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

<title>Bridging Language Gaps: Advances in Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval with Multilingual LLMs</title>

Abstract: Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) addresses the challenge of retrieving relevant documents written in languages different from that of the original query. Research in this area has typically framed the task as monolingual retrieval augmented by translation, treating retrieval methods and cross-lingual capabilities in isolation. Both monolingual and cross-lingual retrieval usually follow a pipeline of query expansion, ranking, re-ranking and, increasingly, question answering. Recent advances, however, have shifted from translation-based methods toward embedding-based approaches and leverage multilingual large language models (LLMs), for which aligning representations across languages remains a central challenge. The emergence of cross-lingual embeddings and multilingual LLMs has introduced a new paradigm, offering improved retrieval performance and enabling answer generation. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of developments from early translation-based methods to state-of-the-art embedding-driven and generative techniques. It presents a structured account of core CLIR components, evaluation practices, and available resources. Persistent challenges such as data imbalance and linguistic variation are identified, while promising directions are suggested for advancing equitable and effective cross-lingual information retrieval. By situating CLIR within the broader landscape of information retrieval and multilingual language processing, this work not only reviews current capabilities but also outlines future directions for building retrieval systems that are robust, inclusive, and adaptable.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success, we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time by over 70%.

<title>Spiralformer: Low Latency Encoder for Streaming Speech Recognition with Circular Layer Skipping and Early Exiting</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: For streaming speech recognition, a Transformer-based encoder has been widely used with block processing. Although many studies addressed improving emission latency of transducers, little work has been explored for improving encoding latency of the block processing. We seek to reduce latency by frequently emitting a chunk with a small shift rather than scarce large-chunk emissions, resulting in higher computational costs. To efficiently compute with the small chunk shift, we propose a new encoder, Spiralformer, tailored for block processing by combining layer dropping and early exiting. We skip layer computation in a cyclic manner and shift the computed layer in each block spirally, which completes computation for all the layers over the block processing. Experimentally, we observed that our method achieved 21.6% reduction in the averaged token emission delay in Librispeech, and 7.0% in CSJ, compared with the baseline with similar computational cost and word error rates.

Abstract: Code localization is a fundamental challenge in repository-level software engineering tasks such as bug fixing. While existing methods equip language agents with comprehensive tools/interfaces to fetch information from the repository, they overlook the critical aspect of memory, where each instance is typically handled from scratch assuming no prior repository knowledge. In contrast, human developers naturally build long-term repository memory, such as the functionality of key modules and associations between various bug types and their likely fix locations. In this work, we augment language agents with such memory by leveraging a repository's commit history - a rich yet underutilized resource that chronicles the codebase's evolution. We introduce tools that allow the agent to retrieve from a non-parametric memory encompassing recent historical commits and linked issues, as well as functionality summaries of actively evolving parts of the codebase identified via commit patterns. We demonstrate that augmenting such a memory can significantly improve LocAgent, a state-of-the-art localization framework, on both SWE-bench-verified and the more recent SWE-bench-live benchmarks. Our research contributes towards developing agents that can accumulate and leverage past experience for long-horizon tasks, more closely emulating the expertise of human developers.

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized, multidimensional manifolds. Prior efforts focus on discovering specific geometries for specific features, and thus lack generalization. We introduce Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method to automatically discover feature manifolds. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning as a case study, finding that different features form various geometric structures such as circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals many insights on these structures: they consistently reflect the properties of the concepts they represent; are stable across model families and sizes; actively support reasoning in models; and dynamically reshape in response to context changes. Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds, supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform structured representations.

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations validate the measurable gains of each component.

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across 24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which -- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress, existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i) For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length, finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO) policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn agentic RL.

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts. Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR, respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused RL.

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with: verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other, resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM) training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise models' chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) performs {multi-objective alignment} by training the LLM with our $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$ction-$\textbf{H}$ead $\textbf{DPO}$ (MAH-DPO) and a vectorized reward where the dimensions of the vector correspond to the various objectives instead of a single scalar; and (iii) demonstrates how such a system provides fine-grained inference-time user control. Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn dialogue show that our framework improves performance across multiple objectives simultaneously, while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and enabling flexible inference time user control. The code can be found at https://github.com/pearls-lab/multiobj-align.

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions, limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g., code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency; and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced, discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos. Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable, interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/showlab/Code2Video.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work, Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models, applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on MCP-Universe Bench.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance. Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper introduces PhyloLM, a method adapting phylogenetic algorithms to Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore whether and how they relate to each other and to predict their performance characteristics. Our method calculates a phylogenetic distance metric based on the similarity of LLMs' output. The resulting metric is then used to construct dendrograms, which satisfactorily capture known relationships across a set of 111 open-source and 45 closed models. Furthermore, our phylogenetic distance predicts performance in standard benchmarks, thus demonstrating its functional validity and paving the way for a time and cost-effective estimation of LLM capabilities. To sum up, by translating population genetic concepts to machine learning, we propose and validate a tool to evaluate LLM development, relationships and capabilities, even in the absence of transparent training information.

Abstract: We explore the ability of large language models (LLMs) to engage in subtle deception through strategically phrasing and intentionally manipulating information. This harmful behavior can be hard to detect, unlike blatant lying or unintentional hallucination. We build a simple testbed mimicking a legislative environment where a corporate \textit{lobbyist} module is proposing amendments to bills that benefit a specific company while evading identification of this benefactor. We use real-world legislative bills matched with potentially affected companies to ground these interactions. Our results show that LLM lobbyists can draft subtle phrasing to avoid such identification by strong LLM-based detectors. Further optimization of the phrasing using LLM-based re-planning and re-sampling increases deception rates by up to 40 percentage points. Our human evaluations to verify the quality of deceptive generations and their retention of self-serving intent show significant coherence with our automated metrics and also help in identifying certain strategies of deceptive phrasing. This study highlights the risk of LLMs' capabilities for strategic phrasing through seemingly neutral language to attain self-serving goals. This calls for future research to uncover and protect against such subtle deception.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for democratizing large language models (LLM) in the Arab world, a region that has seen slower progress in developing models comparable to state-of-the-art offerings like GPT-4 or ChatGPT 3.5, due to a predominant focus on mainstream languages (e.g., English and Chinese). One practical objective for an Arabic LLM is to utilize an Arabic-specific vocabulary for the tokenizer that could speed up decoding. However, using a different vocabulary often leads to a degradation of learned knowledge since many words are initially out-of-vocabulary (OOV) when training starts. Inspired by the vocabulary learning during Second Language (Arabic) Acquisition for humans, the released AraLLaMA employs progressive vocabulary expansion, which is implemented by a modified BPE algorithm that progressively extends the Arabic subwords in its dynamic vocabulary during training, thereby balancing the OOV ratio at every stage. The ablation study demonstrated the effectiveness of Progressive Vocabulary Expansion. Moreover, AraLLaMA achieves decent performance comparable to the best Arabic LLMs across a variety of Arabic benchmarks. Models, training data, benchmarks, and codes will be all open-sourced.

Abstract: Controlling diversity in LLM-agent simulations is essential for balancing stability in structured tasks with variability in open-ended interactions. However, we observe that dialogue diversity tends to degrade over long-term simulations. To explore the role of prompt design in this phenomenon, we modularized the utterance generation prompt and found that reducing contextual information leads to more diverse outputs. Based on this insight, we propose Adaptive Prompt Pruning (APP), a novel method that allows users to control diversity via a single parameter, lambda. APP dynamically prunes prompt segments based on attention scores and is compatible with existing diversity control methods. We demonstrate that APP effectively modulates diversity through extensive experiments and propose a method to balance the control trade-offs. Our analysis reveals that all prompt components impose constraints on diversity, with the Memory being the most influential. Additionally, high-attention contents consistently suppress output diversity.

Abstract: Machine writing with large language models often relies on retrieval-augmented generation. However, these approaches remain confined within the boundaries of the model's predefined scope, limiting the generation of content with rich information. Specifically, vanilla-retrieved information tends to lack depth, novelty, and suffers from redundancy, which negatively impacts the quality of generated articles, leading to shallow, unoriginal, and repetitive outputs. To address these issues, we propose OmniThink, a slow-thinking machine writing framework that emulates the human-like process of iterative expansion and reflection. The core idea behind OmniThink is to simulate the cognitive behavior of learners as they slowly deepen their knowledge of the topics. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniThink improves the knowledge density of generated articles without compromising metrics such as coherence and depth. Human evaluations and expert feedback further highlight the potential of OmniThink to address real-world challenges in the generation of long-form articles. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/OmniThink.

Abstract: Autoformalization, the automatic translation of mathematical content from natural language into machine-verifiable formal languages, has seen significant progress driven by advances in large language models (LLMs). Nonetheless, a primary barrier to further improvements is the limited availability of parallel corpora that map informal mathematical text to its formal counterpart. To address this limitation, we propose ATLAS (Autoformalizing Theorems through Lifting, Augmentation, and Synthesis of Data), a novel data generation framework designed to produce large-scale, high-quality parallel corpora of theorem statements. Distinct from prior approaches, ATLAS begins with a concept repository, accelerates the improvement of the student model through expert iteration combined with knowledge distillation, and introduces two novel augmentation strategies that exploit the structural characteristics of formal languages. Running the proposed ATLAS framework for 10 iterations, we construct an undergraduate-level dataset of 117k theorem statements and develop the ATLAS Translator by fine-tuning Llama3.1-8B-Instruct with LoRA. This model establishes a new state of the art, demonstrating statistically significant improvements over both the Herald Translator and the Kimina-Autoformalizer across all benchmarks (p<0.05, two-sided t-test). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the full-parameter fine-tuning of a stronger base model on the ATLAS dataset leads to superior performance. The datasets, model, and code are available at https://github.com/XiaoyangLiu-sjtu/ATLAS.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely deployed in downstream tasks, but keeping their knowledge up-to-date via retraining or fine-tuning is often computationally expensive. Model editing provides a more efficient alternative by updating a targeted subset of parameters, which often follows the locate-and-edit paradigm. Despite this efficiency, existing methods are limited: edits may fail to inject knowledge (UnderEdit) or unintentionally disrupt unrelated neighboring knowledge (OverEdit). To address these challenges, we propose two complementary methods: iterative model editing, which applies successive edits to mitigate UnderEdit, and neighbor-assisted model editing, which incorporates neighboring knowledge during editing to reduce OverEdit. Our extensive experiments show that these techniques improve editing performance across multiple LLMs, algorithms, and benchmarks, reducing UnderEdit by up to 38 percentage points and OverEdit by up to 6, while remaining broadly applicable to any locate-and-edit method. We release our code at https://github.com/bhimanbaghel/ResolveUnderOverEdit.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce MedAgentSim, an open-source simulated clinical environment with doctor, patient, and measurement agents designed to evaluate and enhance LLM performance in dynamic diagnostic settings. Unlike prior approaches, our framework requires doctor agents to actively engage with patients through multi-turn conversations, requesting relevant medical examinations (e.g., temperature, blood pressure, ECG) and imaging results (e.g., MRI, X-ray) from a measurement agent to mimic the real-world diagnostic process. Additionally, we incorporate self improvement mechanisms that allow models to iteratively refine their diagnostic strategies. We enhance LLM performance in our simulated setting by integrating multi-agent discussions, chain-of-thought reasoning, and experience-based knowledge retrieval, facilitating progressive learning as doctor agents interact with more patients. We also introduce an evaluation benchmark for assessing the LLM's ability to engage in dynamic, context-aware diagnostic interactions. While MedAgentSim is fully automated, it also supports a user-controlled mode, enabling human interaction with either the doctor or patient agent. Comprehensive evaluations in various simulated diagnostic scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, simulation tool, and benchmark are available at \href{https://medagentsim.netlify.app/}.

Abstract: Conventional retrieval-augmented neural machine translation (RANMT) systems leverage bilingual corpora, e.g., translation memories (TMs). Yet, in many settings, monolingual corpora in the target language are often available. This work explores ways to take advantage of such resources by directly retrieving relevant target language segments, based on a source-side query. For this, we design improved cross-lingual retrieval systems, trained with both sentence level and word-level matching objectives. In our experiments with three RANMT architectures, we assess such cross-lingual objectives in a controlled setting, reaching performances that match those of standard TM-based models. We also showcase our method on a real-world settings, using much larger monolingual and observe strong improvements over both the baseline setting and general-purpose cross-lingual retrievers.

<title>Ambiguity in LLMs is a concept missing problem</title>

Abstract: Ambiguity in natural language is a significant obstacle for achieving accurate text to structured data mapping through large language models (LLMs), which affects the performance of tasks such as mapping text to agentic tool calling and text-to-SQL queries. Existing methods to ambiguity handling either rely on the ReACT framework to obtain correct mappings through trial and error, or on supervised fine-tuning to bias models toward specific tasks. In this paper, we adopt a different approach that characterizes representation differences of ambiguous text in the latent space and leverages these differences to identify ambiguity before mapping them to structured data. To detect sentence-level ambiguity, we focus on the relationship between ambiguous questions and their interpretations. Unlike distances calculated by dense embeddings, we introduce a new distance measure based on a path kernel over concepts. With this measurement, we identify patterns to distinguish ambiguous from unambiguous questions. Furthermore, we propose a method for improving LLM performance on ambiguous agentic tool calling through missing concept prediction. Both achieve state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Legal Passage Retrieval (LPR) systems are crucial as they help practitioners save time when drafting legal arguments. However, it remains an underexplored avenue. One primary reason is the significant vocabulary mismatch between the query and the target passage. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, the Generative query REwriter (GuRE). We leverage the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by training the LLM for query rewriting. "Rewritten queries" help retrievers to retrieve target passages by mitigating vocabulary mismatch. Experimental results show that GuRE significantly improves performance in a retriever-agnostic manner, outperforming all baseline methods. Further analysis reveals that different training objectives lead to distinct retrieval behaviors, making GuRE more suitable than direct retriever fine-tuning for real-world applications. Codes are avaiable at github.com/daehuikim/GuRE.

<title>Unpacking Let Alone: Human-Scale Models Generalize to a Rare Construction in Form but not Meaning</title>

Abstract: Humans have a remarkable ability to acquire and understand grammatical phenomena that are seen rarely, if ever, during childhood. Recent evidence suggests that language models with human-scale pretraining data may possess a similar ability by generalizing from frequent to rare constructions. However, it remains an open question how widespread this generalization ability is, and to what extent this knowledge extends to meanings of rare constructions, as opposed to just their forms. We fill this gap by testing human-scale transformer language models on their knowledge of both the form and meaning of the (rare and quirky) English LET-ALONE construction. To evaluate our LMs we construct a bespoke synthetic benchmark that targets syntactic and semantic properties of the construction. We find that human-scale LMs are sensitive to form, even when related constructions are filtered from the dataset. However, human-scale LMs do not make correct generalizations about LET-ALONE's meaning. These results point to an asymmetry in the current architectures' sample efficiency between language form and meaning, something which is not present in human language learners.

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language understanding but face challenges in adapting to dynamic real-world scenarios that require continuous integration of new knowledge and skills. While continual learning (CL) offers a potential solution, existing benchmarks and methods suffer from critical limitations. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-CL, a novel benchmark encompassing domain and ability continual learning, where the former focuses on independently and identically distributed (IID) evaluation across evolving mainstream domains, whereas the latter evaluates on non-IID scenarios with new model abilities. Methodologically, we propose preventing catastrophic interference through parameter isolation and an MLLM-based routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can integrate domain-specific knowledge and functional abilities with minimal forgetting, significantly outperforming existing methods. Our benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/bjzhb666/MLLM-CL.

Abstract: A central challenge in language models (LMs) is faithfulness hallucination: the generation of information unsubstantiated by input context. To study this problem, we propose Precise Information Control (PIC), a new task formulation that requires models to generate long-form outputs grounded in a provided set of short self-contained statements, without adding any unsupported ones. PIC includes a full setting that tests a model's ability to include exactly all input claims, and a partial setting that requires the model to selectively incorporate only relevant claims. We present PIC-Bench, a benchmark of eight long-form generation tasks (e.g., summarization, biography generation) adapted to the PIC setting, where LMs are supplied with well-formed, verifiable input claims. Our evaluation of a range of open and proprietary LMs on PIC-Bench reveals that, surprisingly, state-of-the-art LMs still hallucinate against user-provided input in over 70% of generations. To alleviate this lack of faithfulness, we introduce a post-training framework that uses a weakly supervised preference data construction method to train an 8B PIC-LM with stronger PIC ability--improving from 69.1% to 91.0% F1 in the full PIC setting. When integrated into end-to-end factual generation pipelines, PIC-LM improves exact match recall by 17.1% on ambiguous QA with retrieval, and factual precision by 30.5% on a birthplace fact-checking task, underscoring the potential of precisely grounded generation.

<title>Through the Valley: Path to Effective Long CoT Training for Small Language Models</title>

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has become a common strategy to enhance reasoning in language models. While effective for large models, we identify a phenomenon we call Long CoT Degradation, in which small language models (SLMs; <=3B parameters) trained on limited long CoT data experience significant performance deterioration. Through extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5, LLaMA3 and Gemma3 families, we demonstrate that this degradation is widespread across SLMs. In some settings, models trained on only 8k long CoT examples lose up to 75% of their original performance before fine-tuning. Strikingly, we further observe that for some particularly small models, even training on 220k long CoT examples fails to recover or surpass their original performance prior to fine-tuning. Our analysis attributes this effect to error accumulation: while longer responses increase the capacity for multi-step reasoning, they also amplify the risk of compounding mistakes. Furthermore, we find that Long CoT Degradation may negatively impacts downstream reinforcement learning (RL), although this can be alleviated by sufficiently scaled supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our findings challenge common assumptions about the benefits of long CoT training for SLMs and offer practical guidance for building more effective small-scale reasoning models.

Abstract: Inference-time steering aims to alter a large language model's (LLM's) responses without changing its parameters, but a central challenge is identifying the internal modules that most strongly govern the target behavior. Existing approaches often rely on simplistic cues or ad hoc heuristics, leading to suboptimal or unintended effects. We introduce REAL, a framework for identifying behavior-relevant modules (attention heads or layers) in Transformer models. For each module, REAL trains a vector-quantized autoencoder (VQ-AE) on its hidden activations and uses a shared, learnable codebook to partition the latent space into behavior-relevant and behavior-irrelevant subspaces. REAL quantifies a module's behavioral relevance by how well its VQ-AE encodings discriminate behavior-aligned from behavior-violating responses via a binary classification metric; this score guides both module selection and steering strength. We evaluate REAL across eight LLMs from the Llama and Qwen families and nine datasets spanning truthfulness enhancement, open-domain QA under knowledge conflicts, and general alignment tasks. REAL enables more effective inference-time interventions, achieving an average relative improvement of 20% (up to 81.5%) over the ITI method on truthfulness steering. In addition, the modules selected by REAL exhibit strong zero-shot generalization in cross-domain truthfulness-steering scenarios.

Abstract: Medical question answering (QA) benchmarks often focus on multiple-choice or fact-based tasks, leaving open-ended answers to real patient questions underexplored. This gap is particularly critical in mental health, where patient questions often mix symptoms, treatment concerns, and emotional needs, requiring answers that balance clinical caution with contextual sensitivity. We present CounselBench, a large-scale benchmark developed with 100 mental health professionals to evaluate and stress-test large language models (LLMs) in realistic help-seeking scenarios. The first component, CounselBench-EVAL, contains 2,000 expert evaluations of answers from GPT-4, LLaMA 3, Gemini, and human therapists on patient questions from the public forum CounselChat. Each answer is rated across six clinically grounded dimensions, with span-level annotations and written rationales. Expert evaluations show that while LLMs achieve high scores on several dimensions, they also exhibit recurring issues, including unconstructive feedback, overgeneralization, and limited personalization or relevance. Responses were frequently flagged for safety risks, most notably unauthorized medical advice. Follow-up experiments show that LLM judges systematically overrate model responses and overlook safety concerns identified by human experts. To probe failure modes more directly, we construct CounselBench-Adv, an adversarial dataset of 120 expert-authored mental health questions designed to trigger specific model issues. Evaluation of 3,240 responses from nine LLMs reveals consistent, model-specific failure patterns. Together, CounselBench establishes a clinically grounded framework for benchmarking LLMs in mental health QA.

arXiv:2506.15674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches, particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.

Abstract: When a news article describes immigration as an "economic burden" or a "humanitarian crisis," it selectively emphasizes certain aspects of the issue. Although \textit{framing} shapes how the public interprets such issues, audiences do not absorb frames passively but actively reorganize the presented information. While this relationship between source content and audience response is well-documented in the social sciences, NLP approaches often ignore it, detecting frames in articles and responses in isolation. We present the first computational framework for large-scale analysis of framing across source content (news articles) and audience responses (reader comments). Methodologically, we refine frame labels and develop a framework that reconstructs dominant frames in articles and comments from sentence-level predictions, and aligns articles with topically relevant comments. Applying our framework across eleven topics and two news outlets, we find that frame reuse in comments correlates highly across outlets, while topic-specific patterns vary. We release a frame classifier that performs well on both articles and comments, a dataset of article and comment sentences manually labeled for frames, and a large-scale dataset of articles and comments with predicted frame labels.

Abstract: Cross-lingual consistency should be considered to assess cross-lingual transferability, maintain the factuality of the model knowledge across languages, and preserve the parity of language model performance. We are thus interested in analyzing, evaluating, and interpreting cross-lingual consistency for factual knowledge. To facilitate our study, we examine multiple pretrained models and tuned models with code-mixed coreferential statements that convey identical knowledge across languages. Interpretability approaches are leveraged to analyze the behavior of a model in cross-lingual contexts, showing different levels of consistency in multilingual models, subject to language families, linguistic factors, scripts, and a bottleneck in cross-lingual consistency on a particular layer. Code-switching training and cross-lingual word alignment objectives show the most promising results, emphasizing the worthiness of cross-lingual alignment supervision and code-switching strategies for both multilingual performance and cross-lingual consistency enhancement. In addition, experimental results suggest promising result for calibrating consistency in the test time via activation patching.

Abstract: Understanding the relationship between training data and model behavior during pretraining is crucial, but existing workflows make this process cumbersome, fragmented, and often inaccessible to researchers. We present TokenSmith, an open-source library for interactive editing, inspection, and analysis of datasets used in Megatron-style pretraining frameworks such as GPT-NeoX, Megatron, and NVIDIA NeMo. TokenSmith supports a wide range of operations including searching, viewing, ingesting, exporting, inspecting, and sampling data, all accessible through a simple user interface and a modular backend. It also enables structured editing of pretraining data without requiring changes to training code, simplifying dataset debugging, validation, and experimentation. TokenSmith is designed as a plug-and-play addition to existing large language model pretraining workflows, thereby democratizing access to production-grade dataset tooling. TokenSmith is hosted on GitHub, with accompanying documentation, tutorials, and a demonstration video (available on YouTube).

Abstract: Research on bias in Text-to-Image (T2I) models has primarily focused on demographic representation and stereotypical attributes, overlooking a fundamental question: how does grammatical gender influence visual representation across languages? We introduce a cross-linguistic benchmark examining words where grammatical gender contradicts stereotypical gender associations (e.g., ``une sentinelle'' - grammatically feminine in French but referring to the stereotypically masculine concept ``guard''). Our dataset spans five gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) and two gender-neutral control languages (English, Chinese), comprising 800 unique prompts that generated 28,800 images across three state-of-the-art T2I models. Our analysis reveals that grammatical gender dramatically influences image generation: masculine grammatical markers increase male representation to 73% on average (compared to 22% with gender-neutral English), while feminine grammatical markers increase female representation to 38% (compared to 28% in English). These effects vary systematically by language resource availability and model architecture, with high-resource languages showing stronger effects. Our findings establish that language structure itself, not just content, shapes AI-generated visual outputs, introducing a new dimension for understanding bias and fairness in multilingual, multimodal systems.

Abstract: Voice-controlled interfaces can support older adults in clinical contexts -- with chatbots being a prime example -- but reliable Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for underrepresented groups remains a bottleneck. This study evaluates state-of-the-art ASR models on language use of older Dutch adults, who interacted with the Welzijn.AI chatbot designed for geriatric contexts. We benchmark generic multilingual ASR models, and models fine-tuned for Dutch spoken by older adults, while also considering processing speed. Our results show that generic multilingual models outperform fine-tuned models, which suggests recent ASR models can generalise well out of the box to real-world datasets. Moreover, our results indicate that truncating generic models is helpful in balancing the accuracy-speed trade-off. Nonetheless, we also find inputs which cause a high word error rate and place them in context.

Our system, CultranAI, focused on data augmentation and LoRA fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) for Arabic cultural knowledge representation. We benchmarked several LLMs to identify the best-performing model for the task. In addition to utilizing the PalmX dataset, we augmented it by incorporating the Palm dataset and curated a new dataset of over 22K culturally grounded multiple-choice questions (MCQs). Our experiments showed that the Fanar-1-9B-Instruct model achieved the highest performance. We fine-tuned this model on the combined augmented dataset of 22K+ MCQs. On the blind test set, our submitted system ranked 5th with an accuracy of 70.50%, while on the PalmX development set, it achieved an accuracy of 84.1%.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across many generation tasks. Nevertheless, effectively aligning them with desired behaviors remains a significant challenge. Activation steering is an effective and cost-efficient approach that directly modifies the activations of LLMs during the inference stage, aligning their responses with the desired behaviors and avoiding the high cost of fine-tuning. Existing methods typically indiscriminately intervene to all generations or rely solely on the question to determine intervention, which limits the accurate assessment of the intervention strength. To this end, we propose the Flexible Activation Steering with Backtracking (FASB) framework, which dynamically determines both the necessity and strength of intervention by tracking the internal states of the LLMs during generation, considering both the question and the generated content. Since intervening after detecting a deviation from the desired behavior is often too late, we further propose the backtracking mechanism to correct the deviated tokens and steer the LLMs toward the desired behavior. Extensive experiments on the TruthfulQA dataset and six multiple-choice datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines. Our code will be released at https://github.com/gjw185/FASB.

Abstract: Effective decision-making often relies on identifying what makes each candidate distinctive. While existing benchmarks for LLMs emphasize retrieving or summarizing information relevant to a given query, they do not evaluate a model's ability to identify globally distinctive features across a set of documents. We introduce Distinctive Feature Mining (DFM), a new task that challenges models to analyze a small-to-medium collection (10-40 documents) and surface features that are rare in the global context (e.g., appearing in less than 10% of documents). This setting mirrors real-world scenarios such as candidate selection or product differentiation, where statistical reasoning, not retrieval, is key. To enable systematic evaluation of this capability, we present DiFBench, a configurable benchmark creation framework with controllable parameters such as document set size and distinctiveness thresholds. Using DiFBench, we perform a large-scale assessment of distinctive feature mining across ten state-of-the-art LLMs. Our findings reveal a significant performance gap between general-purpose and reasoning-enhanced models. All models, however, substantially degrade as the task complexity and document count increase. We also find that a common failure mode is misidentifying frequent features as distinctive. These insights reveal core limitations in contemporary LLMs' abilities to perform fine-grained, statistical reasoning and rarity detection.

Abstract: Background: Evidence synthesis facilitates evidence-based medicine. This task becomes increasingly difficult to accomplished with applying computational solutions, since the medical literature grows at astonishing rates. Objective: This study evaluates an information retrieval-driven workflow, CASMA, to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and reproducibility of systematic reviews. Endometriosis recurrence serves as the ideal case due to its complex and ambiguous literature. Methods: The hybrid approach integrates PRISMA guidelines with fuzzy matching and regular expression (regex) to facilitate semi-automated deduplication and filtered records before manual screening. The workflow synthesised evidence from randomised controlled trials on the efficacy of a subclass of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH-a). A modified splitting method addressed unit-of-analysis errors in multi-arm trials. Results: The workflow sharply reduced the screening workload, taking only 11 days to fetch and filter 33,444 records. Seven eligible RCTs were synthesized (841 patients). The pooled random-effects model yielded a Risk Ratio (RR) of $0.64$ ($95\%$ CI $0.48$ to $0.86$), demonstrating a $36\%$ reduction in recurrence, with non-significant heterogeneity ($I^2=0.00\%$, $\tau^2=0.00$). The findings were robust and stable, as they were backed by sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: This study demonstrates an application of an information-retrieval-driven workflow for medical evidence synthesis. The approach yields valuable clinical results and a generalisable framework to scale up the evidence synthesis, bridging the gap between clinical research and computer science.

Abstract: Reliable evaluation of large language models is essential to ensure their applicability in practical scenarios. Traditional benchmark-based evaluation methods often rely on fixed reference answers, limiting their ability to capture important qualitative aspects of generated responses. To address these shortcomings, we propose an integrated evaluation framework called \textit{self-refining descriptive evaluation with expert-driven diagnostics}, SPEED, which utilizes specialized functional experts to perform comprehensive, descriptive analyses of model outputs. Unlike conventional approaches, SPEED actively incorporates expert feedback across multiple dimensions, including hallucination detection, toxicity assessment, and lexical-contextual appropriateness. Experimental results demonstrate that SPEED achieves robust and consistent evaluation performance across diverse domains and datasets. Additionally, by employing relatively compact expert models, SPEED demonstrates superior resource efficiency compared to larger-scale evaluators. These findings illustrate that SPEED significantly enhances fairness and interpretability in LLM evaluations, offering a promising alternative to existing evaluation methodologies.

Abstract: PaECTER is an open-source document-level encoder specific for patents. We fine-tune BERT for Patents with examiner-added citation information to generate numerical representations for patent documents. PaECTER performs better in similarity tasks than current state-of-the-art models used in the patent domain. More specifically, our model outperforms the patent specific pre-trained language model (BERT for Patents) and general-purpose text embedding models (e.g., E5, GTE, and BGE) on our patent citation prediction test dataset on different rank evaluation metrics. PaECTER predicts at least one most similar patent at a rank of 1.32 on average when compared against 25 irrelevant patents. Numerical representations generated by PaECTER from patent text can be used for downstream tasks such as classification, tracing knowledge flows, or semantic similarity search. Semantic similarity search is especially relevant in the context of prior art search for both inventors and patent examiners.

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) expands the capabilities of modern large language models (LLMs), by anchoring, adapting, and personalizing their responses to the most relevant knowledge sources. It is particularly useful in chatbot applications, allowing developers to customize LLM output without expensive retraining. Despite their significant utility in various applications, RAG systems present new security risks. In this work, we propose a novel attack that allows an adversary to inject a single malicious document into a RAG system's knowledge base, and mount a backdoor poisoning attack. We design Phantom, a general two-stage optimization framework against RAG systems, that crafts a malicious poisoned document leading to an integrity violation in the model's output. First, the document is constructed to be retrieved only when a specific naturally occurring trigger sequence of tokens appears in the victim's queries. Second, the document is further optimized with crafted adversarial text that induces various adversarial objectives on the LLM output, including refusal to answer, reputation damage, privacy violations, and harmful behaviors.We demonstrate our attacks on multiple open-source LLM architectures, including Gemma, Vicuna, and Llama, and show that they transfer to closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4. Finally, we successfully demonstrate our attack on an end-to-end black-box production RAG system: NVIDIA's "Chat with RTX''.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integral to the hospitality and tourism industry, concerns about their fairness in serving diverse identity groups persist. Grounded in social identity theory and sociotechnical systems theory, this study examines ethnic and gender biases in travel recommendations generated by LLMs. Using fairness probing, we analyze outputs from three leading open-source LLMs. The results show that test accuracy for both ethnicity and gender classifiers exceed random chance. Analysis of the most influential features reveals the presence of stereotype bias in LLM-generated recommendations. We also found hallucinations among these features, occurring more frequently in recommendations for minority groups. These findings indicate that LLMs exhibit ethnic and gender bias when functioning as travel planning assistants. This study underscores the need for bias mitigation strategies to improve the inclusivity and reliability of generative AI-driven travel planning assistance.

Abstract: We introduce Krony-PT, a compression technique for GPT-2 based on Kronecker products. We specifically target the feed-forward weights of each transformer block, and systematically compress the feed-forward layer matrices to various degrees. We introduce a modified Van Loan decomposition to initialize new Kronecker factors, and also propose a new pruning-based initialization technique. Our method compresses the original 124M-parameter GPT-2 to various smaller models, ranging from 80M to 96M. Our 81M model variant outperforms DistilGPT2 on next-token prediction across all standard language modeling datasets, and shows competitive or comparable performance with significantly larger Kronecker-based compressions of GPT-2.

Abstract: Top-down images play an important role in safety-critical settings such as autonomous navigation and aerial surveillance, where they provide holistic spatial information that front-view images cannot capture. Despite this, Vision Language Models (VLMs) are mostly trained and evaluated on front-view benchmarks, leaving their performance in the top-down setting poorly understood. Existing evaluations also overlook a unique property of top-down images: their physical meaning is preserved under rotation. In addition, conventional accuracy metrics can be misleading, since they are often inflated by hallucinations or "lucky guesses", which obscures a model's true reliability and its grounding in visual evidence. To address these issues, we introduce TDBench, a benchmark for top-down image understanding that includes 2000 curated questions for each rotation. We further propose RotationalEval (RE), which measures whether models provide consistent answers across four rotated views of the same scene, and we develop a reliability framework that separates genuine knowledge from chance. Finally, we conduct four case studies targeting underexplored real-world challenges. By combining rigorous evaluation with reliability metrics, TDBench not only benchmarks VLMs in top-down perception but also provides a new perspective on trustworthiness, guiding the development of more robust and grounded AI systems.

Abstract: Existing efforts in building Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents largely rely on the training paradigm of supervised fine-tuning on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). However, this approach not only demands extensive amounts of training data but also struggles to effectively understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. The issue significantly limits its application in real-world scenarios, especially for high-level tasks. Inspired by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) in large reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), which efficiently enhances the problem-solving capabilities of large language models in real-world settings, we propose \name, the first reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the GUI capabilities of LVLMs in high-level real-world task scenarios, through unified action space rule modeling. By leveraging a small amount of carefully curated high-quality data across multiple platforms (including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and Web) and employing policy optimization algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update the model, \name achieves superior performance using only 0.02\% of the data (3K vs. 13M) compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like OS-Atlas across eight benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web). These results demonstrate the immense potential of reinforcement learning based on unified action space rule modeling in improving the execution capabilities of LVLMs for real-world GUI agent tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as the leading approach for enhancing reasoning capabilities in large language models. However, it faces a fundamental compute and memory asymmetry: rollout generation is embarrassingly parallel and memory-light, whereas policy updates are communication-heavy and memory-intensive. To address this, we introduce PODS (Policy Optimization with Down-Sampling), which decouples rollout generation from policy updates by training only on a strategically selected subset of rollouts, maintaining learning quality while dramatically reducing update costs. We propose a principled subset selection criterion, max-variance down-sampling, that maximizes reward diversity, and provide an efficient $O(n\log n)$ implementation. Empirically, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with PODS achieves the peak test accuracy of vanilla GRPO at least $\mathbf{1.7\times}$ faster across the different reasoning benchmarks and hardware configurations we tested.

Abstract: Evaluating the programming robustness of large language models (LLMs) is paramount for ensuring their reliability in AI-based software development. However, adversarial attacks exhibit fundamental limitations that compromise fair robustness assessment: they demonstrate contradictory evaluation outcomes where different attack strategies tend to favor different models, and more critically, they operate solely through external perturbations, failing to capture the intrinsic stability essential for autonomous coding agents where subsequent inputs are endogenously generated by the model itself. We introduce EVALOOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluates robustness from a self-consistency perspective, leveraging the natural duality inherent in software engineering tasks (e.g., code generation and code summarization). EVALOOOP establishes a self-contained feedback loop where an LLM iteratively transforms between code and natural language until functional failure occurs, with robustness quantified by a novel Average Sustainable Loops (ASL) metric-the mean number of iterations maintaining functional correctness across benchmark tasks. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without relying on external attack configurations, providing a unified metric that reveals how effectively LLMs preserve semantic integrity through sustained self-referential transformations. We evaluate 96 popular LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 685B parameters, on EVALOOOP equipped with the MBPP Plus benchmark, and found that EVALOOOP typically induces a 2.65%-47.62% absolute drop in pass@1 accuracy within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507, despite inferior initial code generation compared to OpenAI's o-series models and DeepSeek-V3, demonstrated the superior robustness (ASL score).

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with reliable mathematical reasoning, and current verification methods are often computationally expensive. This paper introduces the Energy Outcome Reward Model (EORM), a highly efficient, lightweight post-hoc verifier designed to address this challenge. EORM uses an energy-based framework to rank Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions, learning to distinguish correct from incorrect reasoning using only simple outcome labels, thus eliminating the need for expensive annotations. With only 55M parameters, over 127 times smaller than typical reward models, EORM boosts the accuracy of Llama 3 8B to 90.7\% on GSM8k and 63.7\% on MATH. This performance is achieved by efficiently selecting the optimal reasoning path from a pool of candidates, allowing it to match or exceed the accuracy of far more resource-intensive Best-of-N sampling techniques. Crucially, our experiments show that EORM generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution problems and unseen models, indicating it learns fundamental principles of valid reasoning. This robustness, combined with its efficiency, establishes EORM as a practical tool for deploying more dependable LLMs in complex, real-world applications.

Abstract: With advancements in large audio-language models (LALMs), which enhance large language models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities, these models are expected to demonstrate universal proficiency across various auditory tasks. While numerous benchmarks have emerged to assess LALMs' performance, they remain fragmented and lack a structured taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we conduct a comprehensive survey and propose a systematic taxonomy for LALM evaluations, categorizing them into four dimensions based on their objectives: (1) General Auditory Awareness and Processing, (2) Knowledge and Reasoning, (3) Dialogue-oriented Ability, and (4) Fairness, Safety, and Trustworthiness. We provide detailed overviews within each category and highlight challenges in this field, offering insights into promising future directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey specifically focused on the evaluations of LALMs, providing clear guidelines for the community. We will release the collection of the surveyed papers and actively maintain it to support ongoing advancements in the field.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) typically build on ViTs (e.g., CLIP), yet their training with simple random in-batch negatives limits the ability to capture fine-grained visual differences, particularly in geometric scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel hard negative contrastive learning framework for the vision encoder, which combines image-based contrastive learning using generation-based hard negatives created by perturbing diagram generation code, and text-based contrastive learning using rule-based negatives derived from modified geometric descriptions and retrieval-based negatives selected based on caption similarity. We train a vision encoder (CLIP) using our hard negative training method, namely MMCLIP (Multimodal Math CLIP), and subsequently train an LMM for geometric problem-solving. Experiments show that our trained model, MMGeoLM, significantly outperforms other open-source models on three geometric reasoning benchmarks. Even with a size of 7B, it can rival powerful closed-source models like GPT-4o. We further conduct ablation studies to analyze three key factors: hard negative types, the efficiency of image-based negatives, and training configurations. These analyses yield important insights into optimizing the training pipeline of vision encoder for fine-grained geometric reasoning tasks. https://github.com/THU-KEG/MMGeoLM.

arXiv:2506.04018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents become more widespread, associated misalignment risks increase. While prior research has studied agents' ability to produce harmful outputs or follow malicious instructions, it remains unclear how likely agents are to spontaneously pursue unintended goals in realistic deployments. In this work, we approach misalignment as a conflict between the internal goals pursued by the model and the goals intended by its deployer. We introduce a misalignment propensity benchmark, \textsc{AgentMisalignment}, a benchmark suite designed to evaluate the propensity of LLM agents to misalign in realistic scenarios. Evaluations cover behaviours such as avoiding oversight, resisting shutdown, sandbagging, and power-seeking. Testing frontier models, we find that more capable agents tend to exhibit higher misalignment on average. We also systematically vary agent personalities through different system prompts and observe that persona characteristics can strongly and unpredictably influence misalignment, sometimes more than the choice of model itself. Our results reveal the limitations of current alignment methods for autonomous LLM agents and underscore the need to rethink misalignment in realistic deployment settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are commonly finetuned for a variety of use cases and domains. A common approach is to leverage Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) -- known to provide strong performance at low resource costs. In this study, we demonstrate that LoRA actually opens the door to short-cut vulnerabilities -- and the more resource efficient is the LoRA setup, the more vulnerable will be the finetuned model to aggressive attacks. To measure that vulnerability, we introduce Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI), where we find that LoRA exclusively focuses on even just a single token that is spuriously correlated with downstream labels. In short, injection of that spurious token during finetuning ensure that the model's prediction at test-time can be manipulated on-demand. We conducted experiments across model families and datasets to evaluate the impact of SSTI during LoRA finetuning while providing possible mitigations. Our experiments conclude that none of the existing checkers and preprocessors can sanitize a dataset raising new concerns for data quality and AI safety.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 series have achieved notable performance enhancements on complex reasoning tasks by scaling up the generation length by Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, a critical issue is their tendency to produce excessively verbose reasoning processes, leading to the inefficiency problem. Existing literature on improving efficiency mainly adheres to the before-reasoning paradigms such as prompting and reasoning or fine-tuning and reasoning, but ignores the promising direction of directly encouraging the model to speak concisely by intervening during the generation of reasoning. In order to fill the blank, we propose a framework dubbed ConciseHint, which continuously encourages the reasoning model to speak concisely by injecting learnable hints (manually designed or learned on concise data) during the generation of the reasoning. Besides, ConciseHint is adaptive to the complexity of the query by adaptively adjusting the hint intensity, which ensures it will not undermine model performance. Experiments on the state-of-the-art LRMs, including DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen-3 series, demonstrate that our method can effectively produce concise reasoning while maintaining the performance well. Moreover, we show that ConciseHint is flexible and can be seamlessly integrated with existing methods to further push the upper bound of the efficiency.

Abstract: This work presents a novel, fully Riemannian framework for Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) that geometrically treats low-rank adapters by optimizing them directly on the fixed-rank manifold. This formulation eliminates the parametrization ambiguity present in standard Euclidean optimizers. Our framework integrates three key components to achieve this: (1) we derive Riemannion, a new Riemannian optimizer on the fixed-rank matrix manifold that generalizes the recently proposed Muon optimizer; (2) we develop a Riemannian gradient-informed LoRA initialization, and (3) we provide an efficient implementation without prominent overhead that uses automatic differentiation to compute arising geometric operations while adhering to best practices in numerical linear algebra. Comprehensive experimental results on both LLM and diffusion model architectures demonstrate that our approach yields consistent and noticeable improvements in convergence speed and final task performance over both standard LoRA and its state-of-the-art modifications.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture, despite its widespread success, struggles with long-context scenarios due to quadratic computation and linear memory growth. While various linear attention variants mitigate these efficiency constraints by compressing context into fixed-size states, they often degrade performance in tasks such as in-context retrieval and reasoning. To address this limitation and achieve more effective context compression, we propose two key innovations. First, we introduce a row-sparse update formulation for linear attention by conceptualizing state updating as information classification. This enables sparse state updates via softmax-based top-$k$ hard classification, thereby extending receptive fields and reducing inter-class interference. Second, we present Sparse State Expansion (SSE) within the sparse framework, which expands the contextual state into multiple partitions, effectively decoupling parameter size from state capacity while maintaining the sparse classification paradigm. Supported by efficient parallelized implementations, our design achieves effective classification and highly discriminative state representations. We extensively validate SSE in both pure linear and hybrid (SSE-H) architectures across language modeling, in-context retrieval, and mathematical reasoning benchmarks. SSE demonstrates strong retrieval performance and scales favorably with state size. Moreover, after reinforcement learning (RL) training, our 2B SSE-H model achieves state-of-the-art mathematical reasoning performance among small reasoning models, scoring 64.5 on AIME24 and 50.2 on AIME25, significantly outperforming similarly sized open-source Transformers. These results highlight SSE as a promising and efficient architecture for long-context modeling.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) poses significant challenges for agents to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex 3D environments. While recent progress has been driven by large-scale pre-training and data augmentation, current methods still struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios, particularly when complex spatial and temporal reasoning is required. In this work, we propose SkillNav, a modular framework that introduces structured, skill-based reasoning into Transformer-based VLN agents. Our method decomposes navigation into a set of interpretable atomic skills (e.g., Vertical Movement, Area and Region Identification, Stop and Pause), each handled by a specialized agent. To support targeted skill training without manual data annotation, we construct a synthetic dataset pipeline that generates diverse, linguistically natural, skill-specific instruction-trajectory pairs. We then introduce a novel training-free Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based router, which dynamically selects the most suitable agent at each time step by aligning sub-goals with visual observations and historical actions. SkillNav obtains competitive results on commonly used benchmarks and establishes state-of-the-art generalization to the GSA-R2R, a benchmark with novel instruction styles and unseen environments.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models achieve strong performance across diverse tasks but remain prone to hallucinations, where outputs are not grounded in visual inputs. This issue can be attributed to two main biases: text-visual bias, the overreliance on prompts and prior outputs, and co-occurrence bias, spurious correlations between frequently paired objects. We propose Gradient-based Influence-Aware Constrained Decoding (GACD), an inference-based method, that addresses both biases without auxiliary models, and is readily applicable to existing models without finetuning. The core of our approach is bias estimation, which uses first-order Taylor gradients to understand the contribution of individual tokens-visual features and text tokens-to the current output. Based on this analysis, GACD mitigates hallucinations through two components: (1) suppressing spurious visual features correlated with the output objects, and (2) rebalancing cross-modal contributions by strengthening visual features relative to text. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that GACD effectively reduces hallucinations and improves the visual grounding of MLLM outputs.

<title>Imagining Alternatives: Towards High-Resolution 3D Counterfactual Medical Image Generation via Language Guidance</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating 2D images under various conditions; however, the success of these models is largely enabled by extensive, readily available pretrained foundation models. Critically, comparable pretrained models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural language remains unexplored. Addressing this gap would enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression, and enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical conditions in realistic detail. Our work takes a step toward this challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied to neurological imaging, where faithful three-dimensional modeling is essential. On two neurological MRI datasets, our framework simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple Sclerosis and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven disease progression analysis in 3D medical imaging. Project link - https://lesupermomo.github.io/imagining-alternatives/.

<title>An Ethically Grounded LLM-Based Approach to Insider Threat Synthesis and Detection</title>

Abstract: Insider threats are a growing organizational problem due to the complexity of identifying their technical and behavioral elements. A large research body is dedicated to the study of insider threats from technological, psychological, and educational perspectives. However, research in this domain has been generally dependent on datasets that are static and limited access which restricts the development of adaptive detection models. This study introduces a novel, ethically grounded approach that uses the large language model (LLM) Claude Sonnet 3.7 to dynamically synthesize syslog messages, some of which contain indicators of insider threat scenarios. The messages reflect real-world data distributions by being highly imbalanced (1% insider threats). The syslogs were analyzed for insider threats by both Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4o, with their performance evaluated through statistical metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1, specificity, FAR, MCC, and ROC AUC. Sonnet 3.7 consistently outperformed GPT-4o across nearly all metrics, particularly in reducing false alarms and improving detection accuracy. The results show strong promise for the use of LLMs in synthetic dataset generation and insider threat detection.

arXiv:2509.12341v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a simple and provably correct replacement for the contested ``domain-extension'' in Step 9 of a recent windowed-QFT lattice algorithm with complex-Gaussian windows~\citep{chen2024quantum}. As acknowledged by the author, the reported issue is due to a periodicity/support mismatch when applying domain extension to only the first coordinate in the presence of offsets. Our drop-in subroutine replaces domain extension by a pair-shift difference that cancels all unknown offsets exactly and synthesizes a uniform cyclic subgroup (a zero-offset coset) of order $P$ inside $(\mathbb{Z}_{M_2})^n$. A subsequent QFT enforces the intended modular linear relation by plain character orthogonality. The sole structural assumption is a residue-accessibility condition enabling coherent auxiliary cleanup; no amplitude periodicity is used. The unitary is reversible, uses $\mathrm{poly}(\log M_2)$ gates, and preserves upstream asymptotics.

<title>Evolving Language Models without Labels: Majority Drives Selection, Novelty Promotes Variation</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), yet real-world deployment demands models that can self-improve without labels or external judges. Existing self-improvement approaches primarily rely on self-confirmation signals (e.g., confidence, entropy, or consistency) to generate rewards. This reliance drives models toward over-confident, majority-favored solutions, causing an entropy collapse that degrades pass@n and reasoning complexity. To address this, we propose EVOL-RL, a label-free framework that mirrors the evolutionary principle of balancing selection with variation. Concretely, EVOL-RL retains the majority-voted answer as an anchor for stability, but adds a novelty-aware reward that scores each sampled solution by how different its reasoning is from other concurrently generated responses. This majority-for-stability + novelty-for-exploration rule mirrors the variation-selection principle: selection prevents drift, while novelty prevents collapse. Evaluation results show that EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the majority-only baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from baseline's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5% to 37.9%. EVOL-RL not only prevents in-domain diversity collapse but also improves out-of-domain generalization (from math reasoning to broader tasks, e.g., GPQA, MMLU-Pro, and BBEH). The code is available at: https://github.com/YujunZhou/EVOL-RL.

<title>The Illusion of Readiness: Stress Testing Large Frontier Models on Multimodal Medical Benchmarks</title>

Abstract: Large frontier models like GPT-5 now achieve top scores on medical benchmarks. But our stress tests tell a different story. Leading systems often guess correctly even when key inputs like images are removed, flip answers under trivial prompt changes, and fabricate convincing yet flawed reasoning. These aren't glitches; they expose how today's benchmarks reward test-taking tricks over medical understanding. We evaluate six flagship models across six widely used benchmarks and find that high leaderboard scores hide brittleness and shortcut learning. Through clinician-guided rubric evaluation, we show that benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure yet are treated interchangeably, masking failure modes. We caution that medical benchmark scores do not directly reflect real-world readiness. If we want AI to earn trust in healthcare, we must demand more than leaderboard wins and must hold systems accountable for robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real medical demands.

<title>Interactive Recommendation Agent with Active User Commands</title>

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both user satisfaction and business outcomes.

Summary: 
Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) were compared in the context of continual post-training (CPT) using a multimodal model. Results show that SFT leads to forgetting of previous tasks, while RFT maintains knowledge and improves general model capabilities. RFT's implicit regularization mechanism, scaled by reward variance, protects prior knowledge. A rollout-based instance filtering algorithm enhances RFT's stability and efficiency. RFT is identified as a robust paradigm for CPT, superior to SFT. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Continual post-training (CPT) is a popular and effective technique for adapting foundation models like multimodal large language models to specific and ever-evolving downstream tasks. While existing research has primarily concentrated on methods like data replay, model expansion, or parameter regularization, the fundamental role of the learning paradigm within CPT remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a comparative analysis of two core post-training paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), investigating their respective impacts on knowledge retention during CPT. Our experiments are conducted on a benchmark comprising seven diverse multimodal tasks, utilizing Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct as the base model for continual post-training. The investigation yields two significant findings: (1) When continuously learning on downstream tasks, SFT leads to catastrophic forgetting of previously learned tasks. In contrast, RFT inherently preserves prior knowledge and achieve performance comparable to multi-task training. (2) RFT successfully protects and even enhances the model's general knowledge on standard benchmarks (e.g., MMMU and MMLU-Pro). Conversely, SFT degrades general model capabilities severely. Further analysis reveals that this stability is not primarily due to explicit mechanisms like KL penalty or chain-of-thought reasoning. Instead, we identify an implicit regularization mechanism inherent to RFT as a key contributing factor. Our theoretical analysis suggests that RFT's gradient updates are naturally scaled by the reward variance, acting as a data-dependent regularizer that inherently protects previously acquired knowledge. Finally, we propose a rollout-based instance filtering algorithm to enhance the stability and efficiency of RFT. Our comprehensive study demonstrates the superiority of RFT as a robust paradigm for continual post-training.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new reinforcement learning algorithm called CE-GPPO that focuses on managing policy entropy in large language models. By reintroducing gradients from low-probability tokens that are clipped in existing methods, CE-GPPO aims to balance exploration and exploitation during training. The algorithm controls the magnitude of these gradients to achieve a better exploration-exploitation trade-off. The study analyzes entropy dynamics and highlights the importance of clipped tokens in regulating entropy evolution. The proposed algorithm, CE-GPPO, effectively mitigates entropy instability and outperforms strong baselines in experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The authors provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence to support the effectiveness of CE-GPPO in handling complex reasoning tasks with language models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}oordinating \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.

Summary: <br />
The study explores the relationship between undesirable behaviors like deception and core cognitive abilities in language models, specifically DistilGPT-2. They introduce cyclic ablation, an iterative method to test if deception can be removed or is intrinsic to the model. Contrary to the belief that deception is a localized function, the model shows highly resilient deceptive behavior, termed functional regeneration. Each attempt to remove deception through "neurosurgery" led to a decay in linguistic performance, as shown by a rise in perplexity. The results suggest that complex concepts like deception are distributed and intertwined within the model, highlighting the challenges of directly editing models for interpretability purposes. <div>

Abstract: Safety and controllability are critical for large language models. A central question is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized functions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's core cognitive abilities. We introduce "cyclic ablation," an iterative method to test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term functional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this "neurosurgery" caused a gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by a consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view that complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability.

Summary: 
This paper presents a novel approach to assessing text quality in large language models (LLMs) by examining the geometric properties of internal model representations. By analyzing metrics such as Maximum Explainable Variance, Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms across different layers of LLMs, the study establishes that Intrinsic Dimensionality and Effective Rank can act as consistent indicators of text naturalness and quality. Moreover, the research demonstrates that these geometric properties enable the ranking of text from various sources in a consistent manner, emphasizing their ability to reflect intrinsic text characteristics rather than model-specific biases. This reference-free text quality evaluation method eliminates the need for human-annotated datasets, providing practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large language models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal model representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text quality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance, Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms measured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text naturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these geometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a reference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated datasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.

ConflictScope is introduced as a pipeline to evaluate how language models prioritize different values, generating scenarios with value conflicts. This study finds that language models tend to prioritize personal values over protective values in open-ended value conflict settings.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values, such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a foundation for future work in this area.

arXiv:2509.25409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities. Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both answer correctness and usefulness.

Summary:
Emotional text-to-speech technology aims to convey emotions while maintaining clarity and natural prosody. Traditional methods depend on general emotion labels or indirect classifiers and receive feedback at the utterance level. The Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO) framework introduces a novel approach that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at intermediate denoising stages. The core of this method is EASPM, a time-conditioned model that evaluates noisy intermediate speech states and facilitates the automatic construction of preference pairs. EASPO refines the generation process to match these stepwise preferences, allowing for precise emotional control during speech synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of EASPO compared to existing methods in terms of expressiveness and naturalness.<br /><br />Summary: Emotional text-to-speech technology is advanced through the EASPO framework, which enables fine-grained emotional shaping and controllability in speech synthesis. <div>

Summary:
The article introduces the simulator-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SimulRAG) framework, aimed at improving the trustworthiness of large language models (LLMs) in long-form scientific question answering by incorporating scientific simulators as retrieval sources. This framework addresses the challenges of retrieving from scientific simulators and efficiently verifying and updating long-form answers. By providing a generalized simulator retrieval interface and implementing a claim-level generation method utilizing uncertainty estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment, SimulRAG outperforms traditional RAG baselines in both informativeness and factuality. Extensive experiments on a benchmark covering climate science and epidemiology demonstrate a significant improvement in performance, with a 30.4% increase in informativeness and a 16.3% increase in factuality.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems. They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence. However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However, existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level generation.

<div> language models, newsroom workflows, journalistic practices, hallucination, attribution

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) are commonly used in newsrooms but can lead to inaccuracies due to hallucinations. Three tools were tested on a task related to TikTok litigation and policy. 30% of outputs contained hallucinations, with Gemini and ChatGPT having higher rates compared to NotebookLM. Errors mainly involved unsupported characterizations of sources and transforming opinions into general statements. This reveals a mismatch with journalism's requirement for explicit sourcing. The study suggests the need for journalism-specific hallucination taxonomies and tools that prioritize accurate attribution over fluency.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools - ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a 300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%). Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers; instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate attribution rather than optimize for fluency.

<div> Keywords: multilingual automatic speech recognition, Whisper, decoder analysis, sub-token hypotheses, language resource levels

Summary: 
The paper presents an in-depth analysis of Whisper's multilingual decoder, focusing on sub-token hypotheses during transcription across languages of varying resource levels. Through tracing the beam search path, the study captures sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities, revealing disparities in decoding performance. Higher resource languages benefit from a higher likelihood of correct token ranking, greater confidence, lower predictive entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. In contrast, lower resource languages exhibit poorer performance metrics but also show unique clustering patterns in sub-token usage, which can be influenced by typology. By uncovering systematic decoding differences hidden by aggregate error rates, the study emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to address the imbalanced development of speech technology.

Abstract: While large multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models achieve remarkable performance, the internal mechanisms of the end-to-end pipeline, particularly concerning fairness and efficacy across languages, remain underexplored. This paper introduces a fine-grained analysis of Whisper's multilingual decoder, examining its sub-token hypotheses during transcription across languages with various resource levels. Our method traces the beam search path, capturing sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities. Results reveal that higher resource languages benefit from higher likelihood of the correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages fare worse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in sub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis. This sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by aggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to ameliorate the imbalanced development of speech technology.

<div> dataset, pretraining, legal risk, performance, models

Summary:
MixtureVitae is a novel pretraining corpus designed to balance strong model performance with minimized legal risk. The corpus is constructed using a risk-aware approach that combines public-domain and permissively licensed text with low-risk additions like government works and EU TDM-eligible sources. Through transparent filtering, screening, and domain mixing processes, MixtureVitae provides a legally sound foundation for training large language models (LLMs). Experimental results show that models trained on MixtureVitae outperform other permissive datasets across various benchmarks, especially excelling in math and code tasks. The use of risk-mitigated data reduces the need for indiscriminate web scraping and ensures competitiveness while adhering to legal constraints. The dataset and curation recipes are publicly available to support reproducible research efforts.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions (e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at 130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens), models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training. Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks. These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

<title>Calibrating Verbalized Confidence with Self-Generated Distractors</title>

<div> Keywords: Language model, Confidence estimates, Suggestibility bias, DINCO, Calibration<br />
Summary:<br />
- Calibrated confidence estimates are crucial for the trustworthiness of large language model (LLM) outputs.
- Verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores are often miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on low-accuracy instances.
- The overconfidence in LLMs is linked to their suggestibility bias, particularly on claims with little information.
- DINCO is introduced to estimate and adjust for suggestibility bias by considering multiple self-generated distractors.
- DINCO improves calibration by normalizing verbalized confidence and leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims, outperforming traditional approaches even at a lower number of inference calls. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibrated confidence estimates are necessary for large language model (LLM) outputs to be trusted by human users. While LLMs can express their confidence in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about; we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims, allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.

Summary:
Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based Reinforcement Learning is proposed for open-ended reasoning using large language models like HealthBench. Utilizing the model as a grader and generating rubric-based rewards improves reasoning performance and the model's grading abilities. This framework enables faster and more resource-efficient training, surpassing baselines. With just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy subset, a model trained on Qwen3-32B exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard. Moreover, incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data enhances performance, particularly for less capable models. <div>

Abstract: Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines. Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard. Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances performance for less capable models.

<div> pivot-based reinforcement learning, multilingual reasoning, large language models, semantic reward functions, cross-lingual processing

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a framework that boosts multilingual reasoning by leveraging a high-performing English LLM as a reference point. This approach eliminates the need for annotated data in target languages and rewards a multilingual model based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the reference model. Various cross-lingual semantic reward functions are explored, including embedding-based and machine translation approaches. Extensive experiments on multilingual reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PB-RLSVR significantly reduces the performance gap between English and other languages, surpassing traditional PPO baselines. The framework enhances the average multilingual performance of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively, showcasing its efficacy in building truly multilingual reasoning agents.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a significant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a "pivot" model to generate reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference, effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions, including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically, our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively, demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly multilingual reasoning agents.

Summary:<br />
This study focuses on the null subject (NS) stage in language acquisition, where children frequently omit subjects until around 4 years old. It examines how young English speakers sometimes confuse imperative and declarative NS utterances, leading to a temporary null subject grammar. A new computational parameter is proposed to measure this confusion, which is incorporated into a simulated model of obligatory subject grammar learning. The study utilizes a modified version of the Variational Learner model to support the hypothesis that performance influences can affect children's understanding of NS constructions. By integrating computational models into the study of grammatical acquisition, this research provides a framework for considering developmental factors alongside language learning processes. Overall, the study contributes to a better understanding of how children acquire grammatical structures in the early stages of language development.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The empirically established null subject (NS) stage, lasting until about 4 years of age, involves frequent omission of subjects by children. Orfitelli and Hyams (2012) observe that young English speakers often confuse imperative NS utterances with declarative ones due to performance influences, promoting a temporary null subject grammar. We propose a new computational parameter to measure this misinterpretation and incorporate it into a simulated model of obligatory subject grammar learning. Using a modified version of the Variational Learner (Yang, 2012) which works for superset-subset languages, our simulations support Orfitelli and Hyams' hypothesis. More generally, this study outlines a framework for integrating computational models in the study of grammatical acquisition alongside other key developmental factors.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces the Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP) metric for Machine Translation evaluation. PDP improves upon previous evaluation methods by utilizing pairwise differences rather than raw scores, providing a more robust understanding of score distributions. It refines Global Pearson by comparing scores at the segment level. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows that PDP effectively ranks evaluation metrics and aligns better with human error weightings. Noise injection tests demonstrate PDP's robustness to random noise, segment bias, and system bias, while also showing sensitivity to extreme outliers. The PDP metric offers a promising approach to enhancing the accuracy and reliability of Machine Translation evaluation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP), a novel segment-level meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) that address limitations in previous Pearson's $\rho$-based and and Kendall's $\tau$-based meta-evaluation approaches. PDP is a correlation-based metric that utilizes pairwise differences rather than raw scores. It draws on information from all segments for a more robust understanding of score distributions and uses segment-wise pairwise differences to refine Global Pearson to intra-segment score comparisons. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows PDP properly ranks sentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than previous work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates PDP's robustness to random noise, segment bias, and system bias while highlighting its sensitivity to extreme outliers.

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly used to generate image captions in specific styles, such as humor or romantic. However, these transformer-based models often struggle with this subjective task in a zero-shot setting. While preference data can be used to align them toward a desired style, such data is expensive to acquire, limiting the ability to explore the models' full capabilities. This work addresses this by studying the data efficiency of aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles. This approach helps to define the performance limits of these models and determine how little preference data is needed to achieve stylistic saturation, benchmarking their capabilities and limitations.

<div> Keywords: Diffusion large language models, reward-free guidance, autoregressive language models, reinforcement learning, code generation

Summary: 
This paper introduces reward-free guidance (RFG) as a method to guide the reasoning trajectory of diffusion large language models (dLLMs) without explicit process reward annotation. RFG parameterizes the process reward using log-likelihood ratios of enhanced and reference dLLMs, obtained by post-training with reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning. Theoretical justification is provided that RFG induces the reward-guided sampling distribution without requiring additional reward. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks show significant accuracy improvements using RFG, with gains of up to 9.2%. This establishes RFG as a training-free framework for scaling test-time reasoning in dLLMs, without the need for external reward models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in large-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further improving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning process step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning without reliance on external reward models.

<div> Transformers, in the context of neural networks, are studied in terms of their ability to handle a large number of context tokens modeled as probability distributions. The study focuses on the properties of maps between measures that allow for representation as in-context maps through a push forward. These properties include preserving support cardinality and having a uniformly continuous Fréchet derivative. The article shows that transformers can universally approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. Additionally, it demonstrates that the solution map of the Vlasov equation for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime can be approximated by a transformer. The measure-theoretic self-attention in transformers is shown to exhibit properties that enable the identification of an infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer with a Vlasov flow.<br /><br />Summary: Transformers in neural networks are analyzed in terms of handling context tokens as probability distributions. Properties of maps between measures are identified for representation as in-context maps. Transformers can approximate representations with continuous in-context maps. The Vlasov equation solution for interacting particles can be approximated by a transformer, pointing to a connection between transformers and Vlasov flows. Measure-theoretic self-attention in transformers aligns with properties that link it to a Vlasov flow in an infinite depth, mean-field scenario. <div>
arXiv:2509.25611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity, proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work, we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand, these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type, for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with a Vlasov flow.

Summary: Mainstream news organizations influence public perception not only through their articles but also by the topics they choose to cover and how they frame issues. This study introduces a dataset and computational framework to analyze selection and framing bias in news coverage in near real-time. The methodology integrates large language models with news scraping to extract structured annotations on political lean, tone, topics, article type, and major events from hundreds of articles daily. By quantifying coverage dimensions at different levels, researchers can analyze media bias more comprehensively. An interactive web platform allows easy exploration of the data. The dataset enables in-depth analysis of news coverage patterns and biases, supporting academic research and efforts to enhance media accountability. <div>

Abstract: Mainstream news organizations shape public perception not only directly through the articles they publish but also through the choices they make about which topics to cover (or ignore) and how to frame the issues they do decide to cover. However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2024 to present), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to enable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our pipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near-real-time news scraping to extract structured annotations -- including political lean, tone, topics, article type, and major events -- across hundreds of articles per day. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels -- the sentence level, the article level, and the publisher level -- expanding the ways in which researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape. In addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform for convenient exploration of these data. Together, these contributions establish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing empirical resources for future research.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Quebec-French Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs (QFrBLiMP), a corpus designed to evaluate the linguistic knowledge of LLMs on prominent grammatical phenomena in Quebec-French. QFrBLiMP consists of 1,761 minimal pairs annotated with 20 linguistic phenomena. Specifically, these minimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from an official online resource maintained by a Qu\'ebec government institution. Each pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the sentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used to compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different LLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher probabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category. We find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear hierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical limitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these specific tasks.

<div> distributional perspective, benchmark reliability, benchmark harmony, model performance, evaluation

Summary: 
- The study focuses on the importance of ensuring benchmark reliability for trustworthy evaluation and meaningful progress in model development.
- The concept of benchmark harmony is introduced to measure how uniformly a model performs across different subdomains of a benchmark.
- High harmony is seen as a desirable benchmark property, indicating uniform competence across subdomains.
- Mapping benchmarks on a mean-variance plane helps identify reliable evaluations, with high mean and low variance signaling more trustworthy results.
- The analysis highlights the potential for less harmonious benchmarks to give misleading results, as overall accuracy may be skewed by specific subdomains. It recommends reporting harmony alongside accuracy to provide a more robust and distributionally reliable measurement of model performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarks shape scientific conclusions about model capabilities and steer model development. This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks. Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony, which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography, Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of performance.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces BiasUnlearn, a novel framework for debiasing language models. It addresses biases targeting demographic groups while maintaining core capabilities like text coherence and task accuracy. BiasUnlearn employs dual-pathway unlearning mechanisms to forget stereotypes and retain anti-stereotypes, preventing bias polarity reversal through adversarial techniques. Extensive experiments across various evaluation benchmarks show that BiasUnlearn outperforms existing methods in mitigating bias without sacrificing language modeling abilities. The study also highlights the transferability of debiasing weights across model variants, indicating that biases become entrenched during pre-training and persist through fine-tuning stages. <div>

Abstract: Many studies have shown various biases targeting different demographic groups in language models, amplifying discrimination and harming fairness. Recent parameter modification debiasing approaches significantly degrade core capabilities such as text coherence and task accuracy. And Prompt-based debiasing methods, only effective for predefined trigger words, fail to address deeply embedded stereotypical associations in model parameters. In this paper, we propose BiasUnlearn, a novel model debiasing framework which achieves targeted debiasing via dual-pathway unlearning mechanisms coordinating stereotype forgetting with anti-stereotype retention, while preventing bias polarity reversal through adversarial forget set and dynamic dataset swapping. We conducted extensive experiments with multiple language models across various evaluation benchmarks. The results show that BiasUnlearn outperforms existing methods in mitigating bias in language models while retaining language modeling capabilities. Further experiments reveal that debiasing weights are transferable across model variants, confirming that bias representations become entrenched during pre-training and persist through fine-tuning phases.

Summary: LD-MoLE proposes a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for Mixture of LoRA Experts, enabling adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise expert allocation. It replaces non-differentiable TopK selection with a differentiable routing function and allows for the adaptive determination of the number of experts to activate for each token at different layers. An analytical sparsity control objective is introduced to regulate the number of activated experts. Experimental results on large language models show that LD-MoLE outperforms existing methods, achieving superior performance on various benchmarks. The method not only improves performance but also demonstrates the ability to learn token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) is an effective strategy for adapting large language models (LLMs) to the downstream tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on conventional TopK routing, which requires careful hyperparameter tuning and assigns a fixed number of experts to each token. In this work, we propose LD-MoLE, a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for Mixture of LoRA Experts that enables adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise expert allocation. Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover, our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks. Our method not only achieves superior performance, but also demonstrates the ability to learn token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, mathematical reasoning, atomic capabilities, training strategies, cognitive grounded paradigm 

Summary: 
The article discusses the limitations of current Large Language Models (LLMs) in acquiring genuine mathematical concepts and reasoning principles. It introduces a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic capabilities inspired by how humans break down complex problems into fundamental atomic abilities. These atomic abilities are categorized into field-specific abilities across major mathematical fields and logical abilities at different levels. Corresponding training and evaluation datasets are proposed for each atomic capability unit. The article conducts extensive experiments to explore the influence of different atomic capabilities on each other and strategies to elicit specific atomic capabilities. The findings highlight the importance of decoupling mathematical intelligence into atomic components, offering new insights into model cognition and guiding the development of more efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded training strategies towards a paradigm of "atomic thinking". 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in mathematical reasoning capabilities. However, we argue that current large-scale reasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse mathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about whether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles or merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down complex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by this, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic capabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1) field-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra, geometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different levels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with formal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit, and conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities influence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific atomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show many interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances of models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic capabilities. Our findings highlight the importance of decoupling mathematical intelligence into atomic components, providing new insights into model cognition and guiding the development of training strategies toward a more efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded paradigm of "atomic thinking".

Abstract: Text anonymization is essential for responsibly developing and deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, social services, and law. In this work, we propose a novel methodology for privacy-preserving synthetic text generation that leverages the principles of de-identification and the Hiding In Plain Sight (HIPS) theory. Our approach introduces entity-aware control codes to guide controllable generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or prefix tuning. The ICL variant ensures privacy levels consistent with the underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable, high-quality generation. Experiments on legal and clinical datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and utility, offering a practical and effective solution for synthetic text generation in sensitive domains.

Abstract: Recently, advancements in AI counseling based on large language models have shown significant progress. However, existing studies employ a one-time generation approach to synthesize multi-turn dialogue samples, resulting in low therapy fidelity and failing to capture the decision-making rationale behind each response. In this work, we propose CATCH, a novel data synthesis framework designed to address these challenges. Specifically, to improve therapy fidelity, we introduce the Progressive Dialogue Synthesis strategy, which extracts goals, resources, and solutions from a client's self-report, organizes them into structured outlines, and then incrementally generates stage-aligned counseling dialogues. To capture decision-making rationale behind each response, we propose the Memory-Driven Dynamic Planning thinking pattern that integrates memory enhancement, global planning, and strategy reasoning; a collaborative multi-agent optimizer then leverages MDP to attach explicit chain-of-thought to each dialogue turn. Extensive experiments and human evaluations demonstrate that CATCH significantly enhances fidelity and logical coherence in AI counseling.

Summary: 
The paper introduces an automated pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer pairs using structured domain knowledge, specifically focusing on telecom network troubleshooting in the radio access network (RAN) domain. The pipeline consists of a retriever, base generator, and refinement model, integrating documents from a domain-specific knowledge graph to create high-quality QA pairs. Customized scoring is used to filter low-quality samples, ensuring the dataset is suitable for reinforcement fine-tuning. By automating this process, the pipeline reduces the need for manual annotation, making it scalable for specialized domains like telecom. This approach produces complex troubleshooting solution plans without human intervention, offering a solution for building instructional and reinforcement datasets efficiently. The pipeline maintains high technical fidelity while decreasing reliance on manual labeling, demonstrating its effectiveness in generating context-rich QA pairs for domain-specific tasks.

arXiv:2509.25736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale, high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However, generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting, where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever, base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.

Abstract: The detection of hopeful speech in social media has emerged as a critical task for promoting positive discourse and well-being. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach to multiclass hope speech detection across multiple languages, including English, Urdu, and Spanish. We leverage transformer-based models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa, to detect and categorize hope speech into three distinct classes: Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, and Unrealistic Hope. Our proposed methodology is evaluated on the PolyHope dataset for the PolyHope-M 2025 shared task, achieving competitive performance across all languages. We compare our results with existing models, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms of macro F1 scores. We also discuss the challenges in detecting hope speech in low-resource languages and the potential for improving generalization. This work contributes to the development of multilingual, fine-grained hope speech detection models, which can be applied to enhance positive content moderation and foster supportive online communities.

<div> reinforcement learning, language models, truthfulness, hallucinations, accuracy

Summary:
The paper introduces a new approach called TruthRL that aims to improve the truthfulness of large language models (LLMs) by reducing hallucinations and incentivizing models to abstain when uncertain. This is achieved through a reinforcement learning framework with a ternary reward system that differentiates between correct answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. The experiments conducted on four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves truthfulness by 21.1% across various backbone models. The study highlights the challenges faced by existing methods that prioritize accuracy over truthfulness and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed truthfulness-driven approach in balancing factual correctness and uncertainty. This work emphasizes the importance of designing learning objectives to develop truthful LLMs. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy -- models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods: approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models (e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness, underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing truthful LLMs.

Summary: 
- This study examines algorithmic bias in language-based models for automated depression detection, focusing on gender and race/ethnicity disparities. 
- LLMs outperform DNN-based models in classifying depression, particularly for Hispanic participants, with reduced gender bias but persistent racial disparities. 
- The worst-group loss in DNN-based models achieves a better balance between performance and fairness compared to the fairness-regularized loss. 
- In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting, while increasing the number of shots does not further reduce disparities. 
- For race/ethnicity, neither prompting strategies nor increasing the number of shots effectively reduce disparities. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks (DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz (DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness. In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity, neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively reduces disparities.

However, global sensemaking-answering questions by synthesizing information from an entire corpus remains a significant challenge. A prior graph-based approach to global sensemaking lacks retrieval mechanisms, topic specificity, and incurs high inference costs. To address these limitations, we propose ReTAG, a Retrieval-Enhanced, Topic-Augmented Graph framework that constructs topic-specific subgraphs and retrieves the relevant summaries for response generation. Experiments show that ReTAG improves response quality while significantly reducing inference time compared to the baseline. Our code is available at https://github.com/bykimby/retag.

Summary: 
The article introduces DECS, a framework addressing the issue of "overthinking" in large reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning. DECS tackles flaws in current length rewards by penalizing redundant tokens and avoiding rewarding partial redundancy. It features a decoupled token-level reward mechanism and a curriculum batch scheduling strategy. Experimental results demonstrate DECS's ability to reduce reasoning tokens by over 50% across seven benchmarks while maintaining or improving performance. This framework proves that significant gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising the model's reasoning power. <div>

Abstract: While large reasoning models trained with critic-free reinforcement learning and verifiable rewards (RLVR) represent the state-of-the-art, their practical utility is hampered by ``overthinking'', a critical issue where models generate excessively long reasoning paths without any performance benefit. Existing solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2) the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in reasoning tokens by over 50\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising a model's underlying reasoning power.

<div> Keywords: Vision-Language Models, natural language explanations, Visual Fidelity, Contrastiveness, user study 

Summary:
Visual-Language Models (VLMs) provide predictions that are often accompanied by visual context. However, for users who cannot see the visuals, augmenting VLM predictions with natural language explanations can help signal the reliability of the predictions. To address the issue of users being easily convinced by inaccurate explanations, this study proposes evaluating explanation quality through Visual Fidelity and Contrastiveness. These quality scoring functions better align with model correctness compared to existing metrics on tasks like A-OKVQA and VizWiz. A user study showed that displaying these quality scores alongside VLM explanations improved participants' accuracy in predicting VLM correctness by 11.1% and reduced the rate of falsely believing incorrect predictions by 15.4%. These findings demonstrate the importance of explanation quality scores in guiding appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.<br /><br />Summary: Visual-Language Models can benefit from natural language explanations that are evaluated based on Visual Fidelity and Contrastiveness to improve user accuracy and reduce reliance on potentially incorrect predictions. <div>

Abstract: When people query Vision-Language Models (VLMs) but cannot see the accompanying visual context (e.g. for blind and low-vision users), augmenting VLM predictions with natural language explanations can signal which model predictions are reliable. However, prior work has found that explanations can easily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's prediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these quality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than existing explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants have to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual context. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations improves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%, including a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect predictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.

<div> benchmark, Large Language Models (LLMs), scientific confabulation, ReFACT, error localization

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide inaccurate scientific information, undermining their trustworthiness. To address this issue, the article introduces ReFACT, a benchmark for detecting scientific confabulation. ReFACT consists of 1,001 expert-annotated question-answer pairs covering various scientific fields, with precise error spans and types identified in non-factual answers. The benchmark allows for multi-stage evaluation, including confabulation detection, error localization, and correction. Evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art LLMs on ReFACT shows limited performance, with even top models like GPT-4o struggling to differentiate between factual and confabulated scientific answers. This raises concerns about the reliability of LLM-based evaluation methods. The study emphasizes the importance of fine-grained, human-validated benchmarks for detecting and correcting scientific confabulation in specific domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently confabulate scientific facts,severely undermining their trustworthiness. Addressing this challenge requires benchmarks that go beyond binary factuality and enable fine-grained evaluation. We introduce \textbf{ReFACT} (\textit{Reddit False And Correct Texts}), a benchmark of 1,001 expert-annotated question--answer pairs spanning diverse scientific domains for the detection of scientific confabulation. Each instance includes both a scientifically correct answer and a non-factual counterpart annotated with \textbf{precise error spans and error-types}. ReFACT enables multi-stage evaluation: (1) confabulation detection, (2) fine-grained error localization, and (3) correction. We benchmark 9 state-of-the-art LLMs, revealing limited performance ($\sim$50\% accuracy). Even top models such as GPT-4o fail to distinguish factual from confabulated scientific answers, raising concerns about the reliability of \textit{LLM-as-judge} evaluation paradigms. Our findings highlight the need for fine-grained, human-validated benchmarks to detect and correct scientific confabulation in domain-specific contexts. Dataset is released on \href{https://github.com/ddz5431/ReFACT}{GitHub}\footnote{We provide the dataset at: https://github.com/ddz5431/ReFACT}.

Abstract: We investigate the robustness of Whisper-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for two major Indonesian regional languages: Javanese and Sundanese. While recent work has demonstrated strong ASR performance under clean conditions, their effectiveness in noisy environments remains unclear. To address this, we experiment with multiple training strategies, including synthetic noise augmentation and SpecAugment, and evaluate performance across a range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Our results show that noise-aware training substantially improves robustness, particularly for larger Whisper models. A detailed error analysis further reveals language-specific challenges, highlighting avenues for future improvements

<div> role conflicts, large language models, contextual sensitivity, social dilemmas, biases

Summary:
The study introduces RoleConflictBench, a benchmark designed to assess large language models (LLMs) in handling role conflicts, which are social dilemmas where expectations of multiple roles clash. The benchmark generates over 13,000 realistic scenarios across 65 roles, varying responsibilities and situational urgency levels. Analysis of 10 LLMs shows that while they exhibit some contextual sensitivity, their decisions are primarily influenced by biases related to social roles. LLMs demonstrate a preference for roles in the Family and Occupation domains, as well as a prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic religions. This study highlights the need for LLMs to improve their ability to consider situational information in addressing complex social dilemmas. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.25897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans often encounter role conflicts -- social dilemmas where the expectations of multiple roles clash and cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over 13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations) and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases, revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic religions across most evaluatee models.

<div> Keywords: text evaluation, personalization quality, language models, PerQ, computational efficiency <br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces a new method called PerQ for evaluating the personalization quality of text generated by language models. Unlike relying solely on large language models for evaluation, PerQ offers a computationally efficient way to assess specific aspects of a text. By addressing the internal biases of individual language models and recommending the use of multiple models for combined evaluation, PerQ aims to reduce the costs associated with meta-evaluation. A case study comparing the generation capabilities of large and small language models demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed metric in research settings. This approach not only streamlines the evaluation process but also helps in conserving resources by minimizing waste. The method provides a valuable tool for researchers seeking to assess the quality of generated text in a precise and efficient manner. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is introduced, called PerQ. A case study of comparison of generation capabilities of large and small language models shows the usability of the proposed metric in research, effectively reducing the waste of resources.

<div> reinforcement learning, memory management, language model, information extraction, generalization  
Summary:  
Mem-alpha is a reinforcement learning framework designed to improve the management of complex memory systems in large language models. It trains agents to selectively store and update information without pre-defined instructions, optimizing memory construction for question-answering accuracy. The framework includes a specialized training dataset and a memory architecture with core, episodic, and semantic components. Empirical evaluation shows Mem-alpha outperforms existing memory-augmented agent baselines and exhibits robust generalization to sequences significantly longer than its training data. <div>
arXiv:2509.25911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are constrained by limited context windows, necessitating external memory systems for long-term information understanding. Current memory-augmented agents typically depend on pre-defined instructions and tools for memory updates. However, language models may lack the ability to determine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update it, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in suboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also construct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn interaction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to teach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential information chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update the memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering accuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we design a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic components, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on instances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training length, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha.

Summary:<br />
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models commonly use Softmax as the router score function despite its unchallenged assumption as a design choice. This study revisits Nadaraya-Watson regression to show that MoE can be interpreted in a similar mathematical framework. The proposed Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN) offers an alternative to Softmax, based on the input neurons of the output layer. The study recommends using ReLU activation and ℓ2-normalization in the KERN router function. Empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the KERN router function in MoE and large language models (LLMs). Through this exploration, the study adds a new dimension to the understanding of routing functions in MoE models, providing insights that could improve the performance of such models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.25913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\mathrm{Softmax}$ as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using $\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN) and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression, where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer. Motivated by these insights, we propose the \textbf{zero-additional-cost} Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function, as an alternative to $\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router generalizes both $\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers. \textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN implementation, we recommend the use of $\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and $\ell_2$-normalization in $\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style router function \methodNorm.

Summary: Pretrained Transformer encoders are commonly used for sequence labeling, but alternative architectures like xLSTMs and diffusion models have shown promise in language modeling. However, when applied to sequence labeling tasks of varying complexity, label space, and token dependencies across multiple languages, these alternative architectures do not always perform well. While they excel in simpler settings, their performance does not generalize consistently across languages or datasets and falls short on more complex structured tasks. This study highlights the need to consider the adaptability and generalizability of different architectures in sequence labeling tasks, as their effectiveness may vary depending on the specific task requirements and characteristics. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.25918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained Transformer encoders are the dominant approach to sequence labeling. While some alternative architectures-such as xLSTMs, structured state-space models, diffusion models, and adversarial learning-have shown promise in language modeling, few have been applied to sequence labeling, and mostly on flat or simplified tasks. We study how these architectures adapt across tagging tasks that vary in structural complexity, label space, and token dependencies, with evaluation spanning multiple languages. We find that the strong performance previously observed in simpler settings does not always generalize well across languages or datasets, nor does it extend to more complex structured tasks.

Summary: 
This study introduces adversarial strategies for reference-free evaluation metrics in grammatical error correction (GEC) to address the issue of systems that artificially inflate scores. The proposed adversarial systems surpass current state-of-the-art metrics, emphasizing the necessity for more robust evaluation methods in the GEC domain. By demonstrating the vulnerability of current metrics to adversarial attacks and the potential to deceive users, the study highlights the importance of ensuring the reliability and accuracy of automatic evaluation in GEC systems. These findings underscore the need for continued research and development of evaluation techniques that can effectively assess GEC systems' performance and prevent manipulation of scores to mislead users. The study serves as a call to action for improving the evaluation metrics used in the field of grammatical error correction.

Abstract: Reference-free evaluation metrics for grammatical error correction (GEC) have achieved high correlation with human judgments. However, these metrics are not designed to evaluate adversarial systems that aim to obtain unjustifiably high scores. The existence of such systems undermines the reliability of automatic evaluation, as it can mislead users in selecting appropriate GEC systems. In this study, we propose adversarial attack strategies for four reference-free metrics: SOME, Scribendi, IMPARA, and LLM-based metrics, and demonstrate that our adversarial systems outperform the current state-of-the-art. These findings highlight the need for more robust evaluation methods.

<div> methodology, preference, dataset, contextual RMs, Retrieval Augmented Generation

Summary:
RAGferee introduces a new methodology for repurposing question-answering datasets into preference pairs aimed at training contextual Reward Models (RMs) for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings. These RMs focus on judging responses for faithfulness, relevance, appropriate refusals, completeness, and conciseness. By curating a small preference dataset using RAGferee and fine-tuning RMs ranging from 7B to 24B parameters, the RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art performance on ContextualJudgeBench. They surpass larger general corpora-trained RMs by an impressive +15.5% absolute improvement, even though the general RMs were trained on much larger datasets of up to 2.4 million samples. This indicates the effectiveness of RAGferee in creating preference datasets that prioritize groundedness over stylistic features, leading to better-suited RMs for evaluating RAG responses.

Abstract: Existing Reward Models (RMs), typically trained on general preference data, struggle in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which require judging responses for faithfulness to retrieved context, relevance to the user query, appropriate refusals when context is insufficient, completeness and conciseness of information. To address the lack of publicly available RAG-centric preference datasets and specialised RMs, we introduce RAGferee, a methodology that repurposes question-answering (QA) datasets into preference pairs that prioritise groundedness over stylistic features, enabling the training of contextual RMs better suited to judging RAG responses. Using RAGferee, we curate a small preference dataset of 4K samples and fine-tune RMs ranging from 7B to 24B parameters. Our RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art performance on ContextualJudgeBench, surpassing existing 70B+ RMs trained on much larger (up to 2.4M samples) general corpora, with an absolute improvement of +15.5%.

Summary: The article introduces a method called RE$^2$ for improving Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) using large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing methods that rely on text similarity to retrieve examples, RE$^2$ selects examples based on grammatical error explanations. This approach aims to address the issue of mismatched error patterns in retrieved sentences. The study includes experiments on two CGEC datasets and the creation of a grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset. Results show that the proposed method effectively enhances CGEC performance. The research not only contributes to CGEC advancement but also provides a valuable resource for future studies in both CGEC and GEE.<br /> <div>

Abstract: The primary objective of Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) is to detect and correct errors in Chinese sentences. Recent research shows that large language models (LLMs) have been applied to CGEC with significant results. For LLMs, selecting appropriate reference examples can help improve their performance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on text similarity for example retrieval, a strategy that frequently mismatches actual error patterns and retrieves lexically similar yet grammatically irrelevant sentences. To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead of using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of grammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to improve the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets and create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is not only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future studies in both CGEC and GEE. The experimental results on the two datasets indicate that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of CGEC.

Summary:<br />
The study examines the faithfulness of generated rationales by large language models (LLMs) in mathematical and logical reasoning tasks using chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Correct hints significantly improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Acknowledgement of hints varies, with equation-based hints frequently referenced and raw hints silently adopted, indicating that more complex hints push models towards verbalizing their reliance in reasoning. Presentation style influences the acknowledgment of hints, with sycophancy prompts encouraging overt acknowledgement and leak-style prompts increasing accuracy but promoting hidden reliance, potentially reflecting RLHF-related effects. Overall, the study demonstrates that LLM reasoning is shaped by shortcuts that obscure faithfulness to the underlying computations. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.26041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful} to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models (GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First, correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure faithfulness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive question answering and reasoning, yet their real-world deployment remains constrained by knowledge cutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with external search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents to a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query formulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify errors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search. Extensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate substantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the fragility of the search process. We believe these findings offer practical guidance for integrating LLM-powered agents into more complex interactive environments and enabling more autonomous decision-making.

<div> Keywords: machine-generated text detection, Central European languages, benchmark, multilingual evaluation, adversarial robustness

Summary:<br /><br />Machine-generated text detection research has primarily focused on English, rendering existing detectors ineffective for non-English languages. This study addresses this gap by introducing a benchmark for detection methods in Central European languages. The research explores multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, emphasizing the differences in performance across various aspects. It also assesses the adversarial robustness of detection methods. The study suggests that supervised finetuned detectors in Central European languages exhibit superior performance and resistance against obfuscation. This research enhances our understanding of text detection methods in Central European languages and highlights the importance of tailored approaches for different linguistic regions. <div>

Abstract: Machine-generated text detection, as an important task, is predominantly focused on English in research. This makes the existing detectors almost unusable for non-English languages, relying purely on cross-lingual transferability. There exist only a few works focused on any of Central European languages, leaving the transferability towards these languages rather unexplored. We fill this gap by providing the first benchmark of detection methods focused on this region, while also providing comparison of train-languages combinations to identify the best performing ones. We focus on multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, pinpointing the differences of individual aspects, as well as adversarial robustness of detection methods. Supervised finetuned detectors in the Central European languages are found the most performant in these languages as well as the most resistant against obfuscation.

<div> Keywords: large language models, dynamic workflow generation, reasoning tasks, cross-task generalization, diverse domains 

Summary:
DyFlow is a dynamic workflow generation framework designed to improve the efficiency and generalizability of agent systems based on large language models (LLMs). It addresses the challenge of building adaptable workflows for complex reasoning tasks by dynamically constructing and adjusting reasoning procedures based on task requirements and real-time feedback. The framework consists of a designer component that decomposes problems into sub-goals and plans next steps based on intermediate outputs, and an executor component that carries out these plans using dynamic operators. DyFlow outperforms existing baselines across diverse domains such as social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code generation, demonstrating significant improvements in performance and robust generalization. The code for DyFlow is publicly available for use. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.26062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in complex reasoning tasks, but building efficient and generalizable workflows remains a major challenge. Most existing approaches rely on manually designed processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks. While a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied to specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate feedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their operations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these limitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that adaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task requirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task generalization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an executor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals defined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on intermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the executor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with context-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded reasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code generation. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse domains. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/wyf23187/DyFlow.

<title>The Silent Judge: Unacknowledged Shortcut Bias in LLM-as-a-Judge</title>

<div> Keywords: Large language models, automatic judges, response quality, biases, cue acknowledgment <br />
Summary: <br />
The study examines the use of large language models (LLMs) as automatic judges in evaluating system outputs. It focuses on two evaluation datasets, ELI5 and LitBench, and uses models GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash as evaluators. The study reveals that current LLM judges rely on shortcuts introduced in the prompt, leading to biases such as favoring new responses over old and following a provenance hierarchy. Despite the injection of cues in the prompts, the models rarely acknowledge these cues in their decisions. This lack of cue acknowledgment highlights the unfaithfulness of current LLM judges and raises concerns about their reliability in evaluation tasks. The study shows that these biases are especially pronounced in more subjective domains like LitBench, indicating limitations in the current LLM-as-a-judge systems. <div>
arXiv:2509.26072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100 pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair, we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed. Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as evaluators in both research and deployment.

<title>Limited Preference Data? Learning Better Reward Model with Latent Space Synthesis</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26074</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26074</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.26074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data. Existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We propose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the LLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization. Empirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based augmentation on standard benchmarks, achieving superior results while being 18x faster in generation and using a 16,000x smaller model. Our work offers a scalable and effective alternative for enhancing reward modeling through efficient data augmentation. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/lens

<title>IMProofBench: Benchmarking AI on Research-Level Mathematical Proof Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.26076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve, it becomes increasingly important to evaluate their performance on research-level tasks at the frontier of mathematical knowledge. However, existing benchmarks are limited, as they focus solely on final-answer questions or high-school competition problems. To address this gap, we introduce IMProofBench, a private benchmark consisting of 39 peer-reviewed problems developed by expert mathematicians. Each problem requires a detailed proof and is paired with subproblems that have final answers, supporting both an evaluation of mathematical reasoning capabilities by human experts and a large-scale quantitative analysis through automated grading. Furthermore, unlike prior benchmarks, the evaluation setup simulates a realistic research environment: models operate in an agentic framework with tools like web search for literature review and mathematical software such as SageMath. Our results show that current LLMs can succeed at the more accessible research-level questions, but still encounter significant difficulties on more challenging problems. Quantitatively, Grok-4 achieves the highest accuracy of 52% on final-answer subproblems, while GPT-5 obtains the best performance for proof generation, achieving a fully correct solution for 22% of problems. IMProofBench will continue to evolve as a dynamic benchmark in collaboration with the mathematical community, ensuring its relevance for evaluating the next generation of LLMs.

<title>Reinforced Strategy Optimization for Conversational Recommender Systems via Network-of-Experts</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26093</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26093</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.26093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) provide personalized recommendations through multi-turn interactions. With the strong reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), applying them to CRSs has become promising. Yet, existing methods often lack explicit optimization of interaction strategies, relying instead on unified prompts, which can yield suboptimal outcomes. We propose Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO), a hierarchical framework that decomposes response generation into macro-level strategy planning and micro-level adaptation within a network-of-experts. A Planner selects strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage), while an Actor generates responses guided by auxiliary experts for preferences and factual grounding. This disentanglement enables more tractable learning. To address limited multi-turn data, we model strategy learning as reinforcement learning with an LLM-based reward for exploration. Experiments show RSO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of hierarchical strategy optimization.

arXiv:2509.26103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scalable large language model (LLM)-based system that combines aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) with guided summarization to generate concise and interpretable product review summaries for the Wayfair platform. Our approach first extracts and consolidates aspect-sentiment pairs from individual reviews, selects the most frequent aspects for each product, and samples representative reviews accordingly. These are used to construct structured prompts that guide the LLM to produce summaries grounded in actual customer feedback. We demonstrate the real-world effectiveness of our system through a large-scale online A/B test. Furthermore, we describe our real-time deployment strategy and release a dataset of 11.8 million anonymized customer reviews covering 92,000 products, including extracted aspects and generated summaries, to support future research in aspect-guided review summarization.

<title>Vocabulary Customization for Efficient Domain-Specific LLM Deployment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26124</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.26124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When using an LLM to process text outside the training domain(s), an often overlooked factor is vocabulary mismatch, where the general-domain tokenizer fails to capture frequent domain-specific terms, leading to higher token fertility and thus a decrease in processing speed due to suboptimal sub-word splits.
  We address this limitation by augmenting the pretrained vocabulary with a set of domain-specific tokens. To this end, we design an algorithm that extends an existing tokenizer while guaranteeing it never decreases tokenization efficiency: every input sequence is segmented into at most the same number of tokens as before.
  Evaluated on real-world e-Commerce use-cases, the augmented tokenizer significantly shortens input sequences by up to 20% and reduces inference latency on downstream tasks while preserving predictive quality. We further analyze secondary effects, such as the impact on forward pass speed and the rate at which the model adopts the newly introduced tokens, to illustrate the broader benefits of vocabulary adaptation.

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems demonstrate great potential for tackling complex problems, but how competition shapes their behavior remains underexplored. This paper investigates the over-competition in multi-agent debate, where agents under extreme pressure exhibit unreliable, harmful behaviors that undermine both collaboration and task performance. To study this phenomenon, we propose HATE, the Hunger Game Debate, a novel experimental framework that simulates debates under a zero-sum competition arena. Our experiments, conducted across a range of LLMs and tasks, reveal that competitive pressure significantly stimulates over-competition behaviors and degrades task performance, causing discussions to derail. We further explore the impact of environmental feedback by adding variants of judges, indicating that objective, task-focused feedback effectively mitigates the over-competition behaviors. We also probe the post-hoc kindness of LLMs and form a leaderboard to characterize top LLMs, providing insights for understanding and governing the emergent social dynamics of AI community.

Abstract: With their growing capabilities, generative large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly investigated for complex medical tasks. However, their effectiveness in real-world clinical applications remains underexplored. To address this, we present CliniBench, the first benchmark that enables comparability of well-studied encoder-based classifiers and generative LLMs for discharge diagnosis prediction from admission notes in MIMIC-IV dataset. Our extensive study compares 12 generative LLMs and 3 encoder-based classifiers and demonstrates that encoder-based classifiers consistently outperform generative models in diagnosis prediction. We assess several retrieval augmentation strategies for in-context learning from similar patients and find that they provide notable performance improvements for generative LLMs.

We fine-tune and provide publicly the open-source models performing higher than the best submissions of the aforementioned shared task, which employed closed proprietary LLMs. In addition, we find that encoder-decoder definition generators perform on par with their decoder-only counterparts.

arXiv:2509.26189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development research of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on transformer architectures raises key challenges, one of them being the task of distinguishing between human-written text and LLM-generated text. As LLM-generated textual content, becomes increasingly complex over time, and resembles human writing, traditional detection methods are proving less effective, especially as the number and diversity of LLMs continue to grow with new models and versions being released at a rapid pace. This study proposes VietBinoculars, an adaptation of the Binoculars method with optimized global thresholds, to enhance the detection of Vietnamese LLM-generated text. We have constructed new Vietnamese AI-generated datasets to determine the optimal thresholds for VietBinoculars and to enable benchmarking. The results from our experiments show results show that VietBinoculars achieves over 99\% in all two domains of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC on multiple out-of-domain datasets. It outperforms the original Binoculars model, traditional detection methods, and other state-of-the-art approaches, including commercial tools such as ZeroGPT and DetectGPT, especially under specially modified prompting strategies.

arXiv:2509.26216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern logistics management systems, route planning requires high efficiency. The Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP) deals with finding optimal delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles serving geographically distributed customers, without requiring the vehicles to return to the depot after deliveries. The present study is comparative in nature and speaks of two algorithms for OCVRP solution: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired metaheuristic; and Google OR-Tools, an industry-standard toolkit for optimization. Both implementations were developed in Python and using a custom dataset. Performance appraisal was based on routing efficiency, computation time, and scalability. The results show that ACO allows flexibility in routing parameters while OR-Tools runs much faster with more consistency and requires less input. This could help choose among routing strategies for scalable real-time logistics systems.

<title>Type-Less yet Type-Aware Inductive Link Prediction with Pretrained Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.26224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inductive link prediction is emerging as a key paradigm for real-world knowledge graphs (KGs), where new entities frequently appear and models must generalize to them without retraining. Predicting links in a KG faces the challenge of guessing previously unseen entities by leveraging generalizable node features such as subgraph structure, type annotations, and ontological constraints. However, explicit type information is often lacking or incomplete. Even when available, type information in most KGs is often coarse-grained, sparse, and prone to errors due to human annotation. In this work, we explore the potential of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enrich node representations with implicit type signals. We introduce TyleR, a Type-less yet type-awaRe approach for subgraph-based inductive link prediction that leverages PLMs for semantic enrichment. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that TyleR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in scenarios with scarce type annotations and sparse graph connectivity. To ensure reproducibility, we share our code at https://github.com/sisinflab/tyler .

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications. However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training. In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by 91.0% compared to the vanilla method.

Abstract: We study speech language models that incorporate semantic initialization and planning losses to achieve robust and consistent generation. Our approach initializes speech tokens with self-supervised features, applies a light alignment loss, and trains with thinning and auxiliary objectives that target robustness and content planning. We train three models: a 0.7B speech-only model, a 1.0B speech-only model, and a 1.0B interleaved model with both text and speech. Acoustic studies show that the speech-only models achieve the highest consistency across speaker, gender, sentiment, room, and background factors, surpassing larger systems. Interleaving improves lexical and syntactic probes and semantic--acoustic alignment but reduces consistency. Linear probes show that our initialization biases the model toward content structure while trading off prosody detail. These results show that LM-side design and training mix control the balance between acoustic stability and semantic grounding without changes to the tokenizer or runtime architecture. A demo and model weights are available for exploration.

Abstract: Dialogue summarization aims to distill the core meaning of a conversation into a concise text. This is crucial for reducing the complexity and noise inherent in dialogue-heavy applications. While recent approaches typically train language models to mimic human-written summaries, such supervision is costly and often results in outputs that lack task-specific focus limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications, such as medical tasks. In this paper, we propose \app, a framework for task-oriented utility-based dialogue summarization. \app starts by generating multiple summaries and task-oriented question-answer pairs from a dialogue in a zero-shot manner using a pool of large language models (LLMs). The quality of the generated summaries is evaluated by having LLMs answer task-related questions before \textit{(i)} selecting the best candidate answers and \textit{(ii)} identifying the most informative summary based on these answers. Finally, we fine-tune the best LLM on the selected summaries. When validated on multiple datasets, \app demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving competitive results in various zero-shot settings, rivaling fully-supervised State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods.

<title>Feedback Forensics: A Toolkit to Measure AI Personality</title>

Abstract: Some traits making a "good" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For example, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are sometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear objective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to measure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot Arena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer "better" personality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model responses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight limitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was rolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed overfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues, limited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We introduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality changes, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited across AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI annotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and browser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we analyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets including Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to analyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our Feedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in popular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation data at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the predominant method for adapting large language models (LLMs), yet it often struggles with generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we posit that this performance disparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental difference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes on-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we introduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides SFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning process by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement learning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by sampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The ground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward signal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes static, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the token level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while bypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive experiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a powerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling evidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of generalization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at problem solving by generating chain of thoughts in natural language, but such verbal thinking is computationally costly and prone to overthinking. Recent work instead proposes a latent thinking architecture Huggin-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning steps as sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack interpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the correctness and reliability of its latent thinking processes. In this paper, we provide a systematic study of how Huggin-3.5B thinks in the latent space and how external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We show that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit highly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably predict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these insights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic algorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to optimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse reasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect latent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking processes. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains, and LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking processes. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward modeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed directly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general, efficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of LLMs.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask, enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs - marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.

Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding), inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B, KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models. Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.

Abstract: Factuality assesses the extent to which a language utterance relates to real-world information; it determines whether utterances correspond to facts, possibilities, or imaginary situations, and as such, it is instrumental for fact checking. Factuality is a complex notion that relies on multiple linguistic signals, and has been studied in various disciplines.
  We present a complex, multi-faceted annotation scheme of factuality that combines concepts from a variety of previous works. We developed the scheme for Hebrew, but we trust that it can be adapted to other languages. We also present a set of almost 5,000 sentences in the domain of parliamentary discourse that we manually annotated according to this scheme. We report on inter-annotator agreement, and experiment with various approaches to automatically predict (some features of) the scheme, in order to extend the annotation to a large corpus.

Abstract: Aligning test items to content standards is a critical step in test development to collect validity evidence based on content. Item alignment has typically been conducted by human experts. This judgmental process can be subjective and time-consuming. This study investigated the performance of fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) for automated item alignment using data from a large-scale standardized reading and writing test for college admissions. Different SLMs were trained for alignment at both domain and skill levels respectively with 10 skills mapped to 4 content domains. The model performance was evaluated in multiple criteria on two testing datasets. The impact of types and sizes of the input data for training was investigated. Results showed that including more item text data led to substantially better model performance, surpassing the improvements induced by sample size increase alone. For comparison, supervised machine learning models were trained using the embeddings from the multilingual-E5-large-instruct model. The study results showed that fine-tuned SLMs consistently outperformed the embedding-based supervised machine learning models, particularly for the more fine-grained skill alignment. To better understand model misclassifications, multiple semantic similarity analysis including pairwise cosine similarity, Kullback-Leibler divergence of embedding distributions, and two-dimension projections of item embeddings were conducted. These analyses consistently showed that certain skills in SAT and PSAT were semantically too close, providing evidence for the observed misclassification.

<title>Adaptive Planning for Multi-Attribute Controllable Summarization with Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.26435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable summarization moves beyond generic outputs toward human-aligned summaries guided by specified attributes. In practice, the interdependence among attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated constraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary attributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior control performance, outperforming all competitors.

arXiv:2509.26461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present CreAgentive, an agent workflow driven multi-category creative generation engine that addresses four key limitations of contemporary large language models in writing stories, drama and other categories of creatives: restricted genre diversity, insufficient output length, weak narrative coherence, and inability to enforce complex structural constructs. At its core, CreAgentive employs a Story Prototype, which is a genre-agnostic, knowledge graph-based narrative representation that decouples story logic from stylistic realization by encoding characters, events, and environments as semantic triples. CreAgentive engages a three-stage agent workflow that comprises: an Initialization Stage that constructs a user-specified narrative skeleton; a Generation Stage in which long- and short-term objectives guide multi-agent dialogues to instantiate the Story Prototype; a Writing Stage that leverages this prototype to produce multi-genre text with advanced structures such as retrospection and foreshadowing. This architecture reduces storage redundancy and overcomes the typical bottlenecks of long-form generation. In extensive experiments, CreAgentive generates thousands of chapters with stable quality and low cost (less than $1 per 100 chapters) using a general-purpose backbone model. To evaluate performance, we define a two-dimensional framework with 10 narrative indicators measuring both quality and length. Results show that CreAgentive consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves robust performance across diverse genres, approaching the quality of human-authored novels.

Abstract: We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model (RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet. Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.

<title>dParallel: Learnable Parallel Decoding for dLLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.26488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently drawn considerable attention within the research community as a promising alternative to autoregressive generation, offering parallel token prediction and lower inference latency. Yet, their parallel decoding potential remains largely underexplored, as existing open-source models still require nearly token-length decoding steps to ensure performance. To address this, we introduce dParallel, a simple and effective method that unlocks the inherent parallelism of dLLMs for fast sampling. We identify that the key bottleneck to parallel decoding arises from the sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. Building on this insight, we introduce the core of our approach: certainty-forcing distillation, a novel training strategy that distills the model to follow its original sampling trajectories while enforcing it to achieve high certainty on masked tokens more rapidly and in parallel. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the number of decoding steps while maintaining performance. When applied to the LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, dParallel reduces decoding steps from 256 to 30 on GSM8K, achieving an 8.5x speedup without performance degradation. On the MBPP benchmark, it cuts decoding steps from 256 to 24, resulting in a 10.5x speedup while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/czg1225/dParallel

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios, existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools. Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator, enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical real-world applications. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are available at https://vitabench.github.io/

<title>BatonVoice: An Operationalist Framework for Enhancing Controllable Speech Synthesis with Linguistic Intelligence from LLMs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.26514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping multimodel models, with speech synthesis being a prominent application. However, existing approaches often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a ``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual ``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficiently scaling large language models without a proportional increase in computational cost. However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE models from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the number of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit precipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE (M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly into the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated experts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking: top-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained capabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail. We explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise randomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that a single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at various expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist models, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not only unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by allocating different computational budgets to different model layers. Our work paves the way for more practical and adaptable deployments of large-scale MoE models.

Abstract: We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility, dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are available at https://github.com/OceanGPT/OceanGym.

arXiv:2509.26543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive explanations, which indicate why an AI system produced one output (the target) instead of another (the foil), are widely regarded in explainable AI as more informative and interpretable than standard explanations. However, obtaining such explanations for speech-to-text (S2T) generative models remains an open challenge. Drawing from feature attribution techniques, we propose the first method to obtain contrastive explanations in S2T by analyzing how parts of the input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs. Through a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, we show that our method accurately identifies the audio features that drive the selection of one gender over another. By extending the scope of contrastive explanations to S2T, our work provides a foundation for better understanding S2T models.

<title>Towards Reliable Benchmarking: A Contamination Free, Controllable Evaluation Framework for Multi-step LLM Function Calling</title>

arXiv:2509.26553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As language models gain access to external tools via structured function calls, they become increasingly more capable of solving complex, multi-step tasks. However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs) provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth, and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3% for GPT-5.

Abstract: Machine translation benchmarks sourced from the real world are quickly obsoleted, due to most examples being easy for state-of-the-art translation models. This limits the benchmark's ability to distinguish which model is better or to reveal models' weaknesses. Current methods for creating difficult test cases, such as subsampling or from-scratch synthesis, either fall short of identifying difficult examples or suffer from a lack of diversity and naturalness. Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for model failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model iteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The LLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its generation of difficult examples. Our approach generates examples that are more challenging for the target MT model while preserving the diversity of natural texts. While the examples are tailored to a particular machine translation model during the generation, the difficulty also transfers to other models and languages.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) begin to saturate existing benchmarks, automated benchmark creation using LLMs (LLM as a benchmark) has emerged as a scalable alternative to slow and costly human curation. While these generated test sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical flaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator), with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed self bias.

Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423 human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping, and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

Abstract: While previous AI Scientist systems can generate novel findings, they often lack the focus to produce scientifically valuable contributions that address pressing human-defined challenges. We introduce DeepScientist, a system designed to overcome this by conducting goal-oriented, fully autonomous scientific discovery over month-long timelines. It formalizes discovery as a Bayesian Optimization problem, operationalized through a hierarchical evaluation process consisting of "hypothesize, verify, and analyze". Leveraging a cumulative Findings Memory, this loop intelligently balances the exploration of novel hypotheses with exploitation, selectively promoting the most promising findings to higher-fidelity levels of validation. Consuming over 20,000 GPU hours, the system generated about 5,000 unique scientific ideas and experimentally validated approximately 1100 of them, ultimately surpassing human-designed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three frontier AI tasks by 183.7\%, 1.9\%, and 7.9\%. This work provides the first large-scale evidence of an AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific tasks, producing valuable findings that genuinely push the frontier of scientific discovery. To facilitate further research into this process, we will open-source all experimental logs and system code at https://github.com/ResearAI/DeepScientist/.

<title>Searching for Difficult-to-Translate Test Examples at Scale</title>

Abstract: NLP models require test data that are sufficiently challenging. The difficulty of an example is linked to the topic it originates from (''seed topic''). The relationship between the topic and the difficulty of its instances is stochastic in nature: an example about a difficult topic can happen to be easy, and vice versa. At the scale of the Internet, there are tens of thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing and evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally infeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit problem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a cost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its difficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics within a fixed computational budget. We illustrate the bandit problem setup of finding difficult examples for the task of machine translation. We find that various bandit strategies vastly outperform baseline methods like brute-force searching the most challenging topics.

<title>Scaling Spoken Language Models with Syllabic Speech Tokenization</title>

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling, evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a 2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient long-context spoken language models.

<title>Convergence and Divergence of Language Models under Different Random Seeds</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence of language models (LMs) trained under different random seeds, measuring convergence as the expected per-token Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence across seeds. By comparing LM convergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a four-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a sharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a slow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge faster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually reconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to learn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token frequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is uneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words converge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens and content words). Overall, our findings highlight factors that influence the stability of the learned distributions in model training.

<title>Artificial Phantasia: Evidence for Propositional Reasoning-Based Mental Imagery in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models (LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens. These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite (TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1 delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches, such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast, Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at https://github.com/kevin671/cot-vs-loop.

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs) typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering. However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics, commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

<title>Language Model Planning from an Information Theoretic Perspective</title>

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning, that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior. Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar, path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

<title>Dynamic Policy Induction for Adaptive Prompt Optimization: Bridging the Efficiency-Accuracy Gap via Lightweight Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs. This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function, learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5% token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

Abstract: This paper presents ActorDB ( Dekigoto ) , a novel database architecture that tightly integrates a single-writer actor model for writes, Incremental View Maintenance (IVM), and a zero-trust security model as a core component. The primary contribution of this work is the unification of these powerful but complex concepts into a single, cohesive system designed to reduce architectural complexity for developers of modern, data-intensive applications. We argue that by providing these capabilities out-of-the-box, ActorDB can offer a more robust, secure, and developer-friendly platform compared to solutions that require manual integration of separate systems for actor persistence, stream processing, and security. We present the core architecture, discuss the critical trade-offs in its design, and define the performance criteria for a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to validate our approach.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks. Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g., ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks (e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count ($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical deployment of LLM agents.

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast, neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations. Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the *training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of *when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be *predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$ is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings, through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning, multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are available at https://github.com/OptMN-Lab/ALoRA.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection. Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often modified after release through post-processing such as post-training or quantization, which makes it challenging to determine whether one model is derived from another. Existing provenance detection methods have two main limitations: (1) they embed signals into the base model before release, which is infeasible for already published models, or (2) they compare outputs across models using hand-crafted or random prompts, which are not robust to post-processing. In this work, we propose LLMPrint, a novel detection framework that constructs fingerprints by exploiting LLMs' inherent vulnerability to prompt injection. Our key insight is that by optimizing fingerprint prompts to enforce consistent token preferences, we can obtain fingerprints that are both unique to the base model and robust to post-processing. We further develop a unified verification procedure that applies to both gray-box and black-box settings, with statistical guarantees. We evaluate LLMPrint on five base models and around 700 post-trained or quantized variants. Our results show that LLMPrint achieves high true positive rates while keeping false positive rates near zero.

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration, DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration, which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3) adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves 62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged computation.

Abstract: The evolution of digital communication systems and the designs of online platforms have inadvertently facilitated the subconscious propagation of toxic behavior. Giving rise to reactive responses to toxic behavior. Toxicity in online content and Artificial Intelligence Systems has become a serious challenge to individual and collective well-being around the world. It is more detrimental to society than we realize. Toxicity, expressed in language, image, and video, can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context of usage. Therefore, a comprehensive taxonomy is crucial to detect and mitigate toxicity in online content, Artificial Intelligence systems, and/or Large Language Models in a proactive manner. A comprehensive understanding of toxicity is likely to facilitate the design of practical solutions for toxicity detection and mitigation. The classification in published literature has focused on only a limited number of aspects of this very complex issue, with a pattern of reactive strategies in response to toxicity. This survey attempts to generate a comprehensive taxonomy of toxicity from various perspectives. It presents a holistic approach to explain the toxicity by understanding the context and environment that society is facing in the Artificial Intelligence era. This survey summarizes the toxicity-related datasets and research on toxicity detection and mitigation for Large Language Models, social media platforms, and other online platforms, detailing their attributes in textual mode, focused on the English language. Finally, we suggest the research gaps in toxicity mitigation based on datasets, mitigation strategies, Large Language Models, adaptability, explainability, and evaluation.

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model degradation.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management, iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits: state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

<title>Causal Autoencoder-like Generation of Feedback Fuzzy Cognitive Maps with an LLM Agent</title>

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

<title>STAC: When Innocent Tools Form Dangerous Chains to Jailbreak LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: As LLMs advance into autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities, they introduce security challenges that extend beyond traditional content-based LLM safety concerns. This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC), a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined, collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated prompts or responses.

<title>Nudging the Boundaries of LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are "unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer. Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training, even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase. These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples, we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated, avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model. Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has converged.

<title>Can VLM Pseudo-Labels Train a Time-Series QA Model That Outperforms the VLM?</title>

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper, we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM. Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of unlabeled data.

<title>MuPlon: Multi-Path Causal Optimization for Claim Verification through Controlling Confounding</title>

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless, claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization (MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes. In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<title>Importance Sampling for Multi-Negative Multimodal Direct Preference Optimization</title>

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods, validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in preference-based learning.

Abstract: We introduce the first version of the AI Productivity Index (APEX), a benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can perform knowledge work with high economic value. APEX addresses one of the largest inefficiencies in AI research: outside of coding, benchmarks often fail to test economically relevant capabilities. APEX-v1.0 contains 200 test cases and covers four domains: investment banking, management consulting, law, and primary medical care. It was built in three steps. First, we sourced experts with top-tier experience e.g., investment bankers from Goldman Sachs. Second, experts created prompts that reflect high-value tasks in their day-to-day work. Third, experts created rubrics for evaluating model responses. We evaluate 23 frontier models on APEX-v1.0 using an LM judge. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) achieves the highest mean score (64.2%), followed by Grok 4 (61.3%) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Thinking = On) (60.4%). Qwen 3 235B is the best performing open-source model and seventh best overall. There is a large gap between the performance of even the best models and human experts, highlighting the need for better measurement of models' ability to produce economically valuable work.

<title>Rotation Control Unlearning: Quantifying and Controlling Continuous Unlearning for LLM with The Cognitive Rotation Space</title>

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data. However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore, we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests, effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of grounding complex visual cues in this domain. All code and data can be found on our Github under the CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel environments.

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources, and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data. Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and Codeforces.

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions. Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman performance on LongCap-Arena.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning, where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions. However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation. Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and "cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch", our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

<title>Lita: Light Agent Uncovers the Agentic Coding Capabilities of LLMs</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models' coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent), which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

<title>A Multimodal LLM Approach for Visual Question Answering on Multiparametric 3D Brain MRI</title>

Abstract: We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient training without image--report pretraining. To address limited image-text paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering (VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation annotations, and we collaborate with medical experts for clinical validation. mpLLM outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across multiple mpMRI datasets. Our study features three main contributions: (1) the first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology. Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts and prompt-conditioned routing. We have included our source code in the supplementary materials and will release our dataset upon publication.

<title>VLM-FO1: Bridging the Gap Between High-Level Reasoning and Fine-Grained Perception in VLMs</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved without compromising the base model's general visual understanding capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning and fine-grained visual grounding.

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying. For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata (title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information (multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However, current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring 2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to advance research in structured JSON generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

<title>Boosting Process-Correct CoT Reasoning by Modeling Solvability of Multiple-Choice QA</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.25941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

<title>RoRecomp: Enhancing Reasoning Efficiency via Rollout Response Recomposition in Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks) and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp), a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains: reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to 52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance impact.

<title>CAST: Continuous and Differentiable Semi-Structured Sparsity-Aware Training for Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M") sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training, while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format. Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns; 3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally, we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible, unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability, visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

<title>Scaling Up Temporal Domain Generalization via Temporal Experts Averaging</title>

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging (TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes. Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5 models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69% while being up to 60x more efficient.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training, leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce **T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation, explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct ** append, to reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling, and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0% accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

Abstract: Existing approaches to skill proficiency estimation often rely on black-box video classifiers, ignoring multi-view context and lacking explainability. We present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as generative reasoning: it jointly predicts skill level and generates expert-like feedback from egocentric and exocentric videos. Central to our method is an AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing training time by up to 60%. Our approach not only achieves superior accuracy across diverse activities, but also outputs natural language critiques aligned with performance, offering transparent reasoning. These results highlight generative vision-language modeling as a powerful new direction for skill assessment.

Abstract: Large audio-language models are advancing rapidly, yet most evaluations emphasize speech or globally sourced sounds, overlooking culturally distinctive cues. This gap raises a critical question: can current models generalize to localized, non-semantic audio that communities instantly recognize but outsiders do not? To address this, we present TAU (Taiwan Audio Understanding), a benchmark of everyday Taiwanese "soundmarks." TAU is built through a pipeline combining curated sources, human editing, and LLM-assisted question generation, producing 702 clips and 1,794 multiple-choice items that cannot be solved by transcripts alone. Experiments show that state-of-the-art LALMs, including Gemini 2.5 and Qwen2-Audio, perform far below local humans. TAU demonstrates the need for localized benchmarks to reveal cultural blind spots, guide more equitable multimodal evaluation, and ensure models serve communities beyond the global mainstream.

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream, and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench, ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality image editing training datasets.

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways, leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/ShaoShuai0605/Misevolution . Warning: this paper includes examples that may be offensive or harmful in nature.

Abstract: Conversational Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are emerging as a promising paradigm for real-time speech interaction. However, their capacity of temporal dynamics, including the ability to manage timing, tempo and simultaneous speaking, remains a critical and unevaluated challenge for conversational fluency. To address this gap, we introduce the Game-Time Benchmark, a framework to systematically assess these temporal capabilities. Inspired by how humans learn a language through language activities, Game-Time consists of basic instruction-following tasks and advanced tasks with temporal constraints, such as tempo adherence and synchronized responses. Our evaluation of diverse SLM architectures reveals a clear performance disparity: while state-of-the-art models handle basic tasks well, many contemporary systems still struggle with fundamental instruction-following. More critically, nearly all models degrade substantially under temporal constraints, exposing persistent weaknesses in time awareness and full-duplex interaction. The Game-Time Benchmark provides a foundation for guiding future research toward more temporally-aware conversational AI. Demos and datasets are available on our project website https://ga642381.github.io/Game-Time.

<title>SeedPrints: Fingerprints Can Even Tell Which Seed Your Large Language Model Was Trained From</title>

Abstract: Fingerprinting Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for provenance verification and model attribution. Existing methods typically extract post-hoc signatures based on training dynamics, data exposure, or hyperparameters -- properties that only emerge after training begins. In contrast, we propose a stronger and more intrinsic notion of LLM fingerprinting: SeedPrints, a method that leverages random initialization biases as persistent, seed-dependent identifiers present even before training. We show that untrained models exhibit reproducible token selection biases conditioned solely on their parameters at initialization. These biases are stable and measurable throughout training, enabling our statistical detection method to recover a model's lineage with high confidence. Unlike prior techniques, unreliable before convergence and vulnerable to distribution shifts, SeedPrints remains effective across all training stages and robust under domain shifts or parameter modifications. Experiments on LLaMA-style and Qwen-style models show that SeedPrints achieves seed-level distinguishability and can provide birth-to-lifecycle identity verification akin to a biometric fingerprint. Evaluations on large-scale pretrained models and fingerprinting benchmarks further confirm its effectiveness under practical deployment scenarios. These results suggest that initialization itself imprints a unique and persistent identity on neural language models, forming a true ''Galtonian'' fingerprint.

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e., explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned, not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates, security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in judgment and decision-making.

In this paper, we present Ferret-UI Lite, a compact, end-to-end GUI agent that operates across diverse platforms, including mobile, web, and desktop. Utilizing techniques optimized for developing small models, we build our 3B Ferret-UI Lite agent through curating a diverse GUI data mixture from real and synthetic sources, strengthening inference-time performance through chain-of-thought reasoning and visual tool-use, and reinforcement learning with designed rewards. Ferret-UI Lite achieves competitive performance with other small-scale GUI agents. In GUI grounding, Ferret-UI Lite attains scores of $91.6\%$, $53.3\%$, and $61.2\%$ on the ScreenSpot-V2, ScreenSpot-Pro, and OSWorld-G benchmarks, respectively. For GUI navigation, Ferret-UI Lite achieves success rates of $28.0\%$ on AndroidWorld and $19.8\%$ on OSWorld. We share our methods and lessons learned from developing compact, on-device GUI agents.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt (Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced "critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished, research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics. CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to 190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research. Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high), moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically grounded AI tools.

<title>Clarification as Supervision: Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Language Interfaces</title>

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning (AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4 points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39% if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit annotations.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL (PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL. However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency, both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size, ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

Abstract: By summarizing longer consumer health questions into shorter and essential ones, medical question-answering systems can more accurately understand consumer intentions and retrieve suitable answers. However, medical question summarization is very challenging due to obvious distinctions in health trouble descriptions from patients and doctors. Although deep learning has been applied to successfully address the medical question summarization (MQS) task, two challenges remain: how to correctly capture question focus to model its semantic intention, and how to obtain reliable datasets to fairly evaluate performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel medical question summarization framework based on entity-driven contrastive learning (ECL). ECL employs medical entities present in frequently asked questions (FAQs) as focuses and devises an effective mechanism to generate hard negative samples. This approach compels models to focus on essential information and consequently generate more accurate question summaries. Furthermore, we have discovered that some MQS datasets, such as the iCliniq dataset with a 33% duplicate rate, have significant data leakage issues. To ensure an impartial evaluation of the related methods, this paper carefully examines leaked samples to reorganize more reasonable datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ECL method outperforms the existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-art performance, i.e., 52.85, 43.16, 41.31, 43.52 in terms of ROUGE-1 metric on MeQSum, CHQ-Summ, iCliniq, HealthCareMagic dataset, respectively.

Abstract: Deploying LLM-based agents in real-life applications often faces a critical challenge: the misalignment between agents' behavior and user intent. Such misalignment may lead agents to unintentionally execute critical actions that carry negative outcomes (e.g., accidentally triggering a "buy-now" in web shopping), resulting in undesirable or even irreversible consequences. Although addressing these issues is crucial, the preemptive detection and correction of misaligned actions remains relatively underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce InferAct, a novel approach that leverages the belief reasoning ability of LLMs, grounded in Theory-of-Mind, to detect misaligned actions before execution. Once the misalignment is detected, InferAct alerts users for timely correction, preventing adverse outcomes and enhancing the reliability of LLM agents' decision-making processes. Experiments on three widely used tasks demonstrate that InferAct achieves up to 20% improvements on Marco-F1 against baselines in misaligned action detection. An in-depth evaluation of misalignment correction further highlights InferAct's effectiveness in improving agent alignment.

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of data augmentation techniques for low-resource automatic speech recognition (ASR), focusing on two endangered Austronesian languages, Amis and Seediq. Recognizing the potential of self-supervised learning (SSL) in low-resource settings, we explore the impact of data volume on the continued pre-training of SSL models. We propose a novel data-selection scheme leveraging a multilingual corpus to augment the limited target language data. This scheme utilizes a language classifier to extract utterance embeddings and employs one-class classifiers to identify utterances phonetically and phonologically proximate to the target languages. Utterances are ranked and selected based on their decision scores, ensuring the inclusion of highly relevant data in the SSL-ASR pipeline. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, yielding substantial improvements in ASR performance for both Amis and Seediq. These findings underscore the feasibility and promise of data augmentation through cross-lingual transfer learning for low-resource language ASR.

Abstract: The surge of large language models (LLMs) has driven significant progress in medical applications, including traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). However, current medical LLMs struggle with TCM diagnosis and syndrome differentiation due to substantial differences between TCM and modern medical theory, and the scarcity of specialized, high-quality corpora. To this end, in this paper we propose BianCang, a TCM-specific LLM, using a two-stage training process that first injects domain-specific knowledge and then aligns it through targeted stimulation to enhance diagnostic and differentiation capabilities. Specifically, we constructed pre-training corpora, instruction-aligned datasets based on real hospital records, and the ChP-TCM dataset derived from the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China. We compiled extensive TCM and medical corpora for continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning, building a comprehensive dataset to refine the model's understanding of TCM. Evaluations across 11 test sets involving 31 models and 4 tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BianCang, offering valuable insights for future research. Code, datasets, and models are available on https://github.com/QLU-NLP/BianCang.

Abstract: In the context of large language models (LLMs), current advanced reasoning methods have made impressive strides in various reasoning tasks. However, when it comes to logical reasoning tasks, major challenges remain in both efficacy and efficiency. This is rooted in the fact that these systems fail to fully leverage the inherent structure of logical tasks throughout the reasoning processes such as decomposition, search, and resolution. To address this, we propose a logic-complete reasoning framework, Aristotle, with three key components: Logical Decomposer, Logical Search Router, and Logical Resolver. In our framework, symbolic expressions and logical rules are comprehensively integrated into the entire reasoning process, significantly alleviating the bottlenecks of logical reasoning, i.e., reducing sub-task complexity, minimizing search errors, and resolving logical contradictions. The experimental results on several datasets demonstrate that Aristotle consistently outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning frameworks in both accuracy and efficiency, particularly excelling in complex logical reasoning scenarios. We will open-source all our code at https://llm-symbol.github.io/Aristotle/.

Abstract: Model NLP models are commonly trained (or fine-tuned) on datasets from untrusted platforms like HuggingFace, posing significant risks of data poisoning attacks. A practical yet underexplored challenge arises when such backdoors are discovered after model deployment, making retraining-required defenses less desirable due to computational costs and data constraints. In this work, we propose Guided Module Substitution (GMS), an effective retraining-free method based on guided merging of the victim model with just a single proxy model. Unlike prior ad-hoc merging defenses, GMS uses a guided trade-off signal between utility and backdoor to selectively replaces modules in the victim model. GMS offers four desirable properties: (1) robustness to the choice and trustworthiness of the proxy model, (2) applicability under inaccurate data knowledge, (3) stability across hyperparameters, and (4) transferability across different attacks. Extensive experiments on encoder models and decoder LLMs demonstrate the strong effectiveness of GMS. GMS significantly outperforms even the strongest defense baseline, particularly against challenging attacks like LWS.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated near-human performance in summarization tasks based on traditional metrics such as ROUGE and BERTScore. However, these metrics do not adequately capture critical aspects of summarization quality, such as factual accuracy, particularly for long narratives (>100K tokens). Recent advances, such as LLM-as-a-Judge, address the limitations of metrics based on lexical similarity but still exhibit factual inconsistencies, especially in understanding character relationships and states. In this work, we introduce NarrativeFactScore, a novel "Agent-as-a-Judge" framework for evaluating and refining summaries. By leveraging a Character Knowledge Graph (CKG) extracted from input and generated summaries, NarrativeFactScore assesses the factual consistency and provides actionable guidance for refinement, such as identifying missing or erroneous facts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NarrativeFactScore through a detailed workflow illustration and extensive validation on widely adopted benchmarks, achieving superior performance compared to competitive methods. Our results highlight the potential of agent-driven evaluation systems to improve the factual reliability of LLM-generated summaries.

Abstract: The wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has attracted significant attention from $\textit{jailbreak}$ attacks, where adversarial prompts crafted through optimization or manual design exploit LLMs to generate malicious contents. However, optimization-based attacks have limited efficiency and transferability, while existing manual designs are either easily detectable or demand intricate interactions with LLMs. In this paper, we first point out a novel perspective for jailbreak attacks: LLMs are more responsive to $\textit{positive}$ prompts. Based on this, we deploy Happy Ending Attack (HEA) to wrap up a malicious request in a scenario template involving a positive prompt formed mainly via a $\textit{happy ending}$, it thus fools LLMs into jailbreaking either immediately or at a follow-up malicious request. This has made HEA both efficient and effective, as it requires only up to two turns to fully jailbreak LLMs. Extensive experiments show that our HEA can successfully jailbreak on state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Llama3-70b, Gemini-pro, and achieves 88.79% attack success rate on average. We also provide quantitative explanations for the success of HEA.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are known to struggle with spatial reasoning and visual alignment. To help overcome these limitations, we introduce iVISPAR, an interactive multimodal benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs acting as agents. \mbox{iVISPAR} is based on a variant of the sliding tile puzzle, a classic problem that demands logical planning, spatial awareness, and multi-step reasoning. The benchmark supports visual 3D, 2D, and text-based input modalities, enabling comprehensive assessments of VLMs' planning and reasoning skills. We evaluate a broad suite of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source VLMs, comparing their performance while also providing optimal path solutions and a human baseline to assess the task's complexity and feasibility for humans. Results indicate that while VLMs perform better on 2D tasks compared to 3D or text-based settings, they struggle with complex spatial configurations and consistently fall short of human performance, illustrating the persistent challenge of visual alignment. This underscores critical gaps in current VLM capabilities, highlighting their limitations in achieving human-level cognition. Project website: https://microcosm.ai/ivispar

Abstract: Recent failures such as Google Gemini generating people of color in Nazi-era uniforms illustrate how AI outputs can be factually plausible yet socially harmful. AI models are increasingly evaluated for "fairness," yet existing benchmarks often conflate two fundamentally different dimensions: factual correctness and normative fairness. A model may generate responses that are factually accurate but socially unfair, or conversely, appear fair while distorting factual reality. We argue that identifying the boundary between fact and fair is essential for meaningful fairness evaluation. We introduce Fact-or-Fair, a benchmark with (i) objective queries aligned with descriptive, fact-based judgments, and (ii) subjective queries aligned with normative, fairness-based judgments. Our queries are constructed from 19 statistics and are grounded in cognitive psychology, drawing on representativeness bias, attribution bias, and ingroup-outgroup bias to explain why models often misalign fact and fairness. Experiments across ten frontier models reveal different levels of fact-fair trade-offs. By reframing fairness evaluation, we provide both a new theoretical lens and a practical benchmark to advance the responsible model assessments. Our test suite is publicly available at https://github.com/uclanlp/Fact-or-Fair.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL aims to convert natural language questions into executable SQL queries. While previous approaches, such as skeleton-masked selection, have demonstrated strong performance by retrieving similar training examples to guide large language models (LLMs), they struggle in real-world scenarios where such examples are unavailable. To overcome this limitation, we propose Self-Augmentation in-context learning with Fine-grained Example selection for Text-to-SQL (SAFE-SQL), a novel framework that improves SQL generation by generating and filtering self-augmented examples. SAFE-SQL first prompts an LLM to generate multiple Text-to-SQL examples relevant to the test input. Then SAFE-SQL filters these examples through three relevance assessments, constructing high-quality in-context learning examples. Using self-generated examples, SAFE-SQL surpasses the previous zero-shot, and few-shot Text-to-SQL frameworks, achieving higher execution accuracy. Notably, our approach provides additional performance gains in extra hard and unseen scenarios, where conventional methods often fail.

Abstract: Reasoning has long been viewed as an emergent property of large language models (LLMs). However, recent studies challenge this assumption, showing that small language models (SLMs) can also achieve competitive reasoning performance. This paper introduces ThinkSLM, the first extensive benchmark to systematically evaluate and study the reasoning abilities of SLMs trained from scratch or derived from LLMs through quantization, pruning, and distillation. We first establish a reliable evaluation criterion comparing available methods and LLM judges against our human evaluations. Then we present a study evaluating 72 diverse SLMs from six major model families across 17 reasoning benchmarks. We repeat all our experiments three times to ensure a robust assessment. Our findings show that: 1) reasoning ability in SLMs is strongly influenced by training methods and data quality rather than solely model scale; 2) quantization preserves reasoning capability, while pruning significantly disrupts it; 3) larger models consistently exhibit higher robustness against adversarial perturbations and intermediate reasoning, but certain smaller models closely match or exceed the larger models' performance. Our findings challenge the assumption that scaling is the only way to achieve strong reasoning. Instead, we foresee a future where SLMs with strong reasoning capabilities can be developed through structured training or post-training compression.

Abstract: Periodicity, as one of the most important basic characteristics, lays the foundation for facilitating structured knowledge acquisition and systematic cognitive processes within human learning paradigms. However, the potential flaws of periodicity modeling in Transformer affect the learning efficiency and establishment of underlying principles from data for large language models (LLMs) built upon it. In this paper, we demonstrate that integrating effective periodicity modeling can improve the learning efficiency and performance of LLMs. We introduce FANformer, which adapts Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) into attention mechanism to achieve efficient periodicity modeling, by modifying the feature projection process of attention mechanism. Extensive experimental results on language modeling show that FANformer consistently outperforms Transformer when scaling up model size and training tokens, underscoring its superior learning efficiency. Our pretrained FANformer-1B exhibits marked improvements on downstream tasks compared to open-source LLMs with similar model parameters or training tokens. Moreover, we reveal that FANformer exhibits superior ability to learn and apply rules for reasoning compared to Transformer. The results position FANformer as an effective and promising architecture for advancing LLMs.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are increasingly used to build agents that can act autonomously to achieve goals. During this automatic process, agents need to take a series of actions, some of which might lead to severe consequences if incorrect actions are taken. Therefore, such agents must sometimes defer-refusing to act when their confidence is insufficient-to avoid the potential cost of incorrect actions. Because the severity of consequences varies across applications, the tendency to defer should also vary: in low-risk settings agents should answer more freely, while in high-risk settings their decisions should be more conservative. We study this "answer-or-defer" problem with an evaluation framework that systematically varies human-specified risk structures-rewards and penalties for correct answers, incorrect answers, and refusals $(r_{\mathrm{cor}},r_{\mathrm{inc}}, r_{\mathrm{ref}})$-while keeping tasks fixed. This design evaluates LMs' risk-aware decision policies by measuring their ability to maximize expected reward. Across multiple datasets and models, we identify flaws in their decision policies: LMs tend to over-answer in high-risk settings and over-defer in low-risk settings. After analyzing the potential cause of such flaws, we find that a simple skill-decomposition method, which isolates the independent skills required for answer-or-defer decision making, can consistently improve LMs' decision policies. Our results highlight the current limitations of LMs in risk-conditioned decision making and provide practical guidance for deploying more reliable LM-based agents across applications of varying risk levels.

Abstract: We present ONERULER, a multilingual benchmark designed to evaluate long-context language models across 26 languages. ONERULER adapts the English-only RULER benchmark (Hsieh et al., 2024) by including seven synthetic tasks that test both retrieval and aggregation, including new variations of the "needle-in-a-haystack" task that allow for the possibility of a nonexistent needle. We create ONERULER through a two-step process, first writing English instructions for each task and then collaborating with native speakers to translate them into 25 additional languages. Experiments with both open-weight and closed LLMs reveal a widening performance gap between low- and high-resource languages as context length increases from 8K to 128K tokens. Surprisingly, English is not the top-performing language on long-context tasks (ranked 6th out of 26), with Polish emerging as the top language. Our experiments also show that many LLMs (particularly OpenAI's o3-mini-high) incorrectly predict the absence of an answer, even in high-resource languages. Finally, in cross-lingual scenarios where instructions and context appear in different languages, performance can fluctuate by up to 20% depending on the instruction language. We hope the release of ONERULER will facilitate future research into improving multilingual and cross-lingual long-context training pipelines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that exploit weaknesses in traditional safety alignment, which often relies on rigid refusal heuristics or representation engineering to block harmful outputs. While they are effective for direct adversarial attacks, they fall short of broader safety challenges requiring nuanced, context-aware decision-making. To address this, we propose Reasoning-enhanced Finetuning for interpretable LLM Safety (Rational), a novel framework that trains models to engage in explicit safe reasoning before response. Fine-tuned models leverage the extensive pretraining knowledge in self-generated reasoning to bootstrap their own safety through structured reasoning, internalizing context-sensitive decision-making. Our findings suggest that safety extends beyond refusal, requiring context awareness for more robust, interpretable, and adaptive responses. Reasoning is not only a core capability of LLMs but also a fundamental mechanism for LLM safety. Rational employs reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning, allowing it to reject harmful prompts while providing meaningful and context-aware responses in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Modelling human variation in rating tasks is crucial for personalization, pluralistic model alignment, and computational social science. We propose representing individuals using natural language value profiles -- descriptions of underlying values compressed from in-context demonstrations -- along with a steerable decoder model that estimates individual ratings from a rater representation. To measure the predictive information in a rater representation, we introduce an information-theoretic methodology and find that demonstrations contain the most information, followed by value profiles, then demographics. However, value profiles effectively compress the useful information from demonstrations (>70% information preservation) and offer advantages in terms of scrutability, interpretability, and steerability. Furthermore, clustering value profiles to identify similarly behaving individuals better explains rater variation than the most predictive demographic groupings. Going beyond test set performance, we show that the decoder predictions change in line with semantic profile differences, are well-calibrated, and can help explain instance-level disagreement by simulating an annotator population. These results demonstrate that value profiles offer novel, predictive ways to describe individual variation beyond demographics or group information.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning demonstrate impressive problem-solving abilities. However, in this work, we identify a recurring issue where these models occasionally generate overly short reasoning, leading to degraded performance on even simple mathematical problems. Specifically, we investigate how reasoning length is embedded in the hidden representations of reasoning models and its impact on accuracy. Our analysis reveals that reasoning length is governed by a linear direction in the representation space, allowing us to induce overly short reasoning by steering the model along this direction. Building on this insight, we introduce ThinkEdit, a simple yet effective weight-editing approach to mitigate the issue of overly short reasoning. We first identify a small subset of attention heads (approximately 4%) that predominantly drive short reasoning behavior. We then edit the output projection weights of these heads to remove the short reasoning direction. With changes to only 0.2% of the model's parameters, ThinkEdit effectively reduces overly short reasoning and yields notable accuracy gains for short reasoning outputs (+6.39%), along with an overall improvement across multiple math benchmarks (+3.34%). Our findings provide new mechanistic insights into how reasoning length is controlled within LLMs and highlight the potential of fine-grained model interventions to improve reasoning quality.

<title>Adaptive Rectification Sampling for Test-Time Compute Scaling</title>

Abstract: The newly released OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated that test-time scaling can significantly improve model performance, especially in complex tasks such as logical reasoning. Common test-time scaling methods involve generating more chains of thought (CoTs) or longer CoTs with self-correction. However, while self-correction can improve performance, it may lead to significant token waste and reduce readability of the CoT if the reasoning steps are already correct. To demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) can rectify errors at a more fine-grained level, we propose Adaptive Rectification Sampling (AR-Sampling), which can guide the LLMs to self-correction at the appropriate step. AR-Sampling leverages a process-supervised reward model (PRM) as a verifier and constructed trigger sentences to guide the model in adaptive step-level rethinking. Through the experiments on GSM8K and MATH500, it indicates that our approach enables the models to rethink in more fine-grained level, improving the accuracy of solutions, while generating a reasonable number of additional tokens.

Abstract: We introduce AutoJudge, a method that accelerates large language model (LLM) inference with task-specific lossy speculative decoding. Instead of matching the original model output distribution token-by-token, we identify which of the generated tokens affect the downstream quality of the response, relaxing the distribution match guarantee so that the "unimportant" tokens can be generated faster. Our approach relies on a semi-greedy search algorithm to test which of the mismatches between target and draft models should be corrected to preserve quality and which ones may be skipped. We then train a lightweight classifier based on existing LLM embeddings to predict, at inference time, which mismatching tokens can be safely accepted without compromising the final answer quality. We evaluate the effectiveness of AutoJudge with multiple draft/target model pairs on mathematical reasoning and programming benchmarks, achieving significant speedups at the cost of a minor accuracy reduction. Notably, on GSM8k with the Llama 3.1 70B target model, our approach achieves up to $\approx2\times$ speedup over speculative decoding at the cost of $\le 1\%$ drop in accuracy. When applied to the LiveCodeBench benchmark, AutoJudge automatically detects programming-specific important tokens, accepting $\ge 25$ tokens per speculation cycle at $2\%$ drop in Pass@1. Our approach requires no human annotation and is easy to integrate with modern LLM inference frameworks.

Abstract: Due to long generations, large language model (LLM) math reasoning demands significant computational resources and time. While many existing efficient inference methods have been developed with excellent performance preservation on language tasks, they often severely degrade math performance. In this paper, we propose Caprese, a resource-efficient distillation method to recover lost capabilities from deploying efficient inference methods, focused primarily in feedforward blocks. With original weights unperturbed, roughly 1% of additional parameters, and only 20K synthetic training samples, we are able to recover much if not all of the math capabilities lost from efficient inference for thinking LLMs and without harm to language tasks for instruct LLMs. Moreover, Caprese slashes the number of active parameters (~2B cut for Gemma 2 9B and Llama 3.1 8B) and integrates cleanly into existing model layers to reduce latency (>16% time-to-next-token reduction) while encouraging response brevity (up to 8.5% fewer tokens).

<title>ELEPHANT: Measuring and understanding social sycophancy in LLMs</title>

Abstract: LLMs are known to exhibit sycophancy: agreeing with and flattering users, even at the cost of correctness. Prior work measures sycophancy only as direct agreement with users' explicitly stated beliefs that can be compared to a ground truth. This fails to capture broader forms of sycophancy such as affirming a user's self-image or other implicit beliefs. To address this gap, we introduce social sycophancy, characterizing sycophancy as excessive preservation of a user's face (their desired self-image), and present ELEPHANT, a benchmark for measuring social sycophancy in an LLM. Applying our benchmark to 11 models, we show that LLMs consistently exhibit high rates of social sycophancy: on average, they preserve user's face 45 percentage points more than humans in general advice queries and in queries describing clear user wrongdoing (from Reddit's r/AmITheAsshole). Furthermore, when prompted with perspectives from either side of a moral conflict, LLMs affirm both sides (depending on whichever side the user adopts) in 48% of cases--telling both the at-fault party and the wronged party that they are not wrong--rather than adhering to a consistent moral or value judgment. We further show that social sycophancy is rewarded in preference datasets, and that while existing mitigation strategies for sycophancy are limited in effectiveness, model-based steering shows promise for mitigating these behaviors. Our work provides theoretical grounding and an empirical benchmark for understanding and addressing sycophancy in the open-ended contexts that characterize the vast majority of LLM use cases.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have improved significantly in their reasoning through extensive training on massive datasets. However, relying solely on additional data for improvement is becoming increasingly impractical, highlighting the need for models to autonomously enhance their reasoning without external supervision. In this paper, we propose Debate, Train, Evolve (DTE), a novel ground truth-free training framework that uses multi-agent debate traces to evolve a single language model. We also introduce a new prompting strategy Reflect-Critique-Refine, to improve debate quality by explicitly instructing agents to critique and refine their reasoning. Extensive evaluations on seven reasoning benchmarks with six open-weight models show that our DTE framework achieve substantial improvements, with an average accuracy gain of 8.92% on the challenging GSM-PLUS dataset. Furthermore, we observe strong cross-domain generalization, with an average accuracy gain of 5.8% on all other benchmarks, suggesting that our method captures general reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have emerged as powerful sources of evidence for linguists seeking to develop theories of syntax. In this paper, we argue that causal interpretability methods, applied to LMs, can greatly enhance the value of such evidence by helping us characterize the abstract mechanisms that LMs learn to use. Our empirical focus is a set of English filler--gap dependency constructions (e.g., questions, relative clauses). Linguistic theories largely agree that these constructions share many properties. Using experiments based in Distributed Interchange Interventions, we show that LMs converge on similar abstract analyses of these constructions. These analyses also reveal previously overlooked factors -- relating to frequency, filler type, and surrounding context -- that could motivate changes to standard linguistic theory. Overall, these results suggest that mechanistic, internal analyses of LMs can push linguistic theory forward.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to develop similar representations for semantically related data, even when they belong to different domains, such as an image and its description, or the same text in different languages. We present a method for quantitatively investigating this phenomenon by measuring the relative information content of the representations of semantically related data and probing how it is encoded into multiple tokens of large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers. Looking first at how LLMs process pairs of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the most language-transferable information. We find moreover that, on these layers, a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information of English text is spread across many tokens and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry. We also identify layers encoding semantic information within visual transformers. We show that caption representations in the semantic layers of LLMs predict visual representations of the corresponding images. We observe significant and model-dependent information asymmetries between image and text representations.

Abstract: An important task in machine learning (ML) research is comparing prior work, which is often performed via ML leaderboards: a tabular overview of experiments with comparable conditions (e.g., same task, dataset, and metric). However, the growing volume of literature creates challenges in creating and maintaining these leaderboards. To ease this burden, researchers have developed methods to extract leaderboard entries from research papers for automated leaderboard curation. Yet, prior work varies in problem framing, complicating comparisons and limiting real-world applicability. In this position paper, we present the first overview of Automatic Leaderboard Generation (ALG) research, identifying fundamental differences in assumptions, scope, and output formats. We propose an ALG unified conceptual framework to standardise how the ALG task is defined. We offer ALG benchmarking guidelines, including recommendations for datasets and metrics that promote fair, reproducible evaluation. Lastly, we outline challenges and new directions for ALG, such as, advocating for broader coverage by including all reported results and richer metadata.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) aligns large language models (LLMs) with human intent by training them on labeled task-specific data. Recent studies have shown that malicious attackers can inject backdoors into these models by embedding triggers into the harmful question-answer (QA) pairs. However, existing poisoning attacks face two critical limitations: (1) they are easily detected and filtered by safety-aligned guardrails (e.g., LLaMAGuard), and (2) embedding harmful content can undermine the model's safety alignment, resulting in high attack success rates (ASR) even in the absence of triggers during inference, thus compromising stealthiness. To address these issues, we propose a novel \textit{clean-data backdoor attack} for jailbreaking LLMs. Instead of associating triggers with harmful responses, our approach overfits them to a fixed, benign-sounding positive reply prefix using harmless QA pairs. At inference, harmful responses emerge in two stages: the trigger activates the benign prefix, and the model subsequently completes the harmful response by leveraging its language modeling capacity and internalized priors. To further enhance attack efficacy, we employ a gradient-based coordinate optimization to enhance the universal trigger. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively \textit{jailbreak backdoor} various LLMs even under the detection of guardrail models, \textit{e.g.}, an ASR of 86.67% and 85% on LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B judged by GPT-4o.

Abstract: Ensuring faithful interpretability in large language models is imperative for trustworthy and reliable AI. A key obstacle is self-repair, a phenomenon where networks compensate for reduced signal in one component by amplifying others, masking the true importance of the ablated component. While prior work attributes self-repair to layer normalization and back-up components that compensate for ablated components, we identify a novel form occurring within the attention mechanism, where softmax redistribution conceals the influence of important attention scores. This leads traditional ablation and gradient-based methods to underestimate the significance of all components contributing to these attention scores. We introduce Gradient Interaction Modifications (GIM), a technique that accounts for self-repair during backpropagation. Extensive experiments across multiple large language models (Gemma 2B/9B, LLAMA 1B/3B/8B, Qwen 1.5B/3B) and diverse tasks demonstrate that GIM significantly improves faithfulness over existing circuit identification and feature attribution methods. Our work is a significant step toward better understanding the inner mechanisms of LLMs, which is crucial for improving them and ensuring their safety.

Abstract: We introduce Frankentexts, a long-form narrative generation paradigm that treats an LLM as a composer of existing texts rather than as an author. Given a writing prompt and thousands of randomly sampled human-written snippets, the model is asked to produce a narrative under the extreme constraint that most tokens (e.g., 90%) must be copied verbatim from the provided paragraphs. This task is effectively intractable for humans: selecting and ordering snippets yields a combinatorial search space that an LLM implicitly explores, before minimally editing and stitching together selected fragments into a coherent long-form story. Despite the extreme challenge of the task, we observe through extensive automatic and human evaluation that Frankentexts significantly improve over vanilla LLM generations in terms of writing quality, diversity, and originality while remaining coherent and relevant to the prompt. Furthermore, Frankentexts pose a fundamental challenge to detectors of AI-generated text: 72% of Frankentexts produced by our best Gemini 2.5 Pro configuration are misclassified as human-written by Pangram, a state-of-the-art detector. Human annotators praise Frankentexts for their inventive premises, vivid descriptions, and dry humor; on the other hand, they identify issues with abrupt tonal shifts and uneven grammar across segments, particularly in longer pieces. The emergence of high-quality Frankentexts raises serious questions about authorship and copyright: when humans provide the raw materials and LLMs orchestrate them into new narratives, who truly owns the result?

Abstract: When thinking with images, humans rarely rely on a single glance: they revisit visual information repeatedly during reasoning. However, existing models typically process images only once and thereafter generate reasoning entirely in text, lacking mechanisms to re-access or ground inference in visual representations. We empirically confirm this: as reasoning chains lengthen, models progressively lose focus on relevant regions. In response, we introduce v1, a lightweight extension that enables active visual referencing through a simple point-and-copy approach. This allows the model to identify relevant image patches and copy their embeddings back into the reasoning stream, ensuring that evolving hypotheses remain grounded in perceptual evidence. Crucially, our pointing strategy lets the MLLM directly select image patches using their semantic representations as keys, keeping perceptual evidence embedded in the same space as the model's reasoning. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of 300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations. Across various multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks, v1 consistently outperforms comparable baselines, establishing dynamic visual access based on point-and-copy as a practical mechanism for grounded reasoning. The model checkpoint and dataset are available at github.com/jun297/v1.

Abstract: The common approach to communicate a large language model's (LLM) uncertainty is to add a percentage number or a hedging word to its response. But is this all we can do? Instead of generating a single answer and then hedging it, an LLM that is fully transparent to the user needs to be able to reflect on its internal belief distribution and output a summary of all options it deems possible, and how likely they are. To test whether LLMs possess this capability, we develop the SelfReflect metric, an information-theoretic distance between a given summary and a distribution over answers. In interventional and human studies, we find that SelfReflect indicates even slight deviations, yielding a fine measure of faithfulness between a summary string and an LLM's actual internal distribution over answers. With SelfReflect, we make a resounding negative observation: modern LLMs are, across the board, incapable of revealing what they are uncertain about, neither through reasoning, nor chains-of-thoughts, nor explicit finetuning. However, we do find that LLMs are able to generate faithful summaries of their uncertainties if we help them by sampling multiple outputs and feeding them back into the context. This simple approach shines a light at the universal way of communicating LLM uncertainties whose future development the SelfReflect score enables.

Abstract: The per-token cost of transformer inference scales with context length, preventing its application to lifelong in-context learning. Linear attention is an efficient alternative that maintains a constant memory footprint, even on infinite context lengths. While this is a potential candidate for lifelong learning, it falls short in memory capacity. In this paper, we propose LoLA, a training-free augmentation to linear attention that boosts associative recall. LoLA distributes past key-value pairs from context into three memory systems: (i) recent pairs in a local sliding window cache; (ii) difficult-to-memorize pairs in a sparse, global cache; and (iii) generic pairs in the recurrent hidden state of linear attention. We show through ablations that our self-recall error metric is crucial to efficiently manage long-term associative memories. On pass-key retrieval tasks, LoLA improves the base model's performance from 0.6% to 97.4% accuracy. This is achieved with a 4.6x smaller cache than Llama-3.1 8B on 4K context length. LoLA also outperforms other 1B and 8B parameter subquadratic models on zero-shot commonsense reasoning tasks.

Abstract: We propose new static word embeddings optimised for sentence semantic representation. We first extract word embeddings from a pre-trained Sentence Transformer, and improve them with sentence-level principal component analysis, followed by either knowledge distillation or contrastive learning. During inference, we represent sentences by simply averaging word embeddings, which requires little computational cost. We evaluate models on both monolingual and cross-lingual tasks and show that our model substantially outperforms existing static models on sentence semantic tasks, and even surpasses a basic Sentence Transformer model (SimCSE) on a text embedding benchmark. Lastly, we perform a variety of analyses and show that our method successfully removes word embedding components that are not highly relevant to sentence semantics, and adjusts the vector norms based on the influence of words on sentence semantics.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently gained attention due to their effectiveness to understand and generate descriptions of visual content. Most existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian, Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities. ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising 1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL, that is shown to provide a better tradeoff between high-and low-resource languages for video understanding. We hope our ViMUL-Bench and multilingual video LMM along with a large-scale multilingual video training set will help ease future research in developing cultural and linguistic inclusive multilingual video LMMs. Our proposed benchmark, video LMM and training data will be publicly released at https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ViMUL/.

Abstract: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) be trained to avoid hallucinating factual statements, and can Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) be triggered only when necessary to reduce retrieval and computation costs? In this work, we address both challenges simultaneously. We introduce ConfQA, a fine-tuning strategy that reduces hallucination rates from 20-40% to below 5% across multiple factuality benchmarks. The approach is simple: when the model answers correctly, it is trained to output the answer; otherwise, it is trained to respond with "I am unsure". Two design choices make this training effective: (1) a dampening prompt ("answer only if you are confident") that explicitly discourages overconfident hallucinations, and (2) training data drawn from atomic factual statements (e.g., knowledge graph attribute values), which calibrates model confidence and yields robust generalization across domains and question types. Building on ConfQA, we propose ConfRAG, a triggering strategy that invokes RAG only when the model responses with unsure. This framework achieves accuracy above 95% in ideal case while reducing unnecessary external retrievals by over 30%.

<title>Efficient Context Selection for Long-Context QA: No Tuning, No Iteration, Just Adaptive-$k$</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and long-context language models (LCLMs) both address context limitations of LLMs in open-domain question answering (QA). However, optimal external context to retrieve remains an open problem: fixing the retrieval size risks either wasting tokens or omitting key evidence. Existing adaptive methods like Self-RAG and Self-Route rely on iterative LLM prompting and perform well on factoid QA, but struggle with aggregation QA, where the optimal context size is both unknown and variable. We present Adaptive-$k$ retrieval, a simple and effective single-pass method that adaptively selects the number of passages based on the distribution of the similarity scores between the query and the candidate passages. It does not require model fine-tuning, extra LLM inferences or changes to existing retriever-reader pipelines. On both factoid and aggregation QA benchmarks, Adaptive-$k$ matches or outperforms fixed-$k$ baselines while using up to 10x fewer tokens than full-context input, yet still retrieves 70% of relevant passages. It improves accuracy across five LCLMs and two embedding models, highlighting that dynamically adjusting context size leads to more efficient and accurate QA.

<title>TableRAG: A Retrieval Augmented Generation Framework for Heterogeneous Document Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated considerable effectiveness in open-domain question answering. However, when applied to heterogeneous documents, comprising both textual and tabular components, existing RAG approaches exhibit critical limitations. The prevailing practice of flattening tables and chunking strategies disrupts the intrinsic tabular structure, leads to information loss, and undermines the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in multi-hop, global queries. To address these challenges, we propose TableRAG, an SQL-based framework that unifies textual understanding and complex manipulations over tabular data. TableRAG iteratively operates in four steps: context-sensitive query decomposition, text retrieval, SQL programming and execution, and compositional intermediate answer generation. We also develop HeteQA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-hop heterogeneous reasoning capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that TableRAG consistently outperforms existing baselines on both public datasets and our HeteQA, establishing a new state-of-the-art for heterogeneous document question answering. We release TableRAG at https://github.com/yxh-y/TableRAG/tree/main.

<title>When Does Multimodality Lead to Better Time Series Forecasting?</title>

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in incorporating textual information into foundation models for time series forecasting. However, it remains unclear whether and under what conditions such multimodal integration consistently yields gains. We systematically investigate these questions across a diverse benchmark of 16 forecasting tasks spanning 7 domains, including health, environment, and economics. We evaluate two popular multimodal forecasting paradigms: aligning-based methods, which align time series and text representations; and prompting-based methods, which directly prompt large language models for forecasting. Our findings reveal that the benefits of multimodality are highly condition-dependent. While we confirm reported gains in some settings, these improvements are not universal across datasets or models. To move beyond empirical observations, we disentangle the effects of model architectural properties and data characteristics, drawing data-agnostic insights that generalize across domains. Our findings highlight that on the modeling side, incorporating text information is most helpful given (1) high-capacity text models, (2) comparatively weaker time series models, and (3) appropriate aligning strategies. On the data side, performance gains are more likely when (4) sufficient training data is available and (5) the text offers complementary predictive signal beyond what is already captured from the time series alone. Our study offers a rigorous, quantitative foundation for understanding when multimodality can be expected to aid forecasting tasks, and reveals that its benefits are neither universal nor always aligned with intuition.

Abstract: Humans continuously infer the states, goals, and behaviors of others by perceiving their surroundings in dynamic, real-world social interactions. However, most Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks only evaluate static, text-based scenarios, which have a significant gap compared to real interactions. We propose the SoMi-ToM benchmark, designed to evaluate multi-perspective ToM in embodied multi-agent complex social interactions. This benchmark is based on rich multimodal interaction data generated by the interaction environment SoMi, covering diverse crafting goals and social relationships. Our framework supports multi-level evaluation: (1) first-person evaluation provides multimodal (visual, dialogue, action, etc.) input from a first-person perspective during a task for real-time state inference, (2) third-person evaluation provides complete third-person perspective video and text records after a task for goal and behavior inference. This evaluation method allows for a more comprehensive examination of a model's ToM capabilities from both the subjective immediate experience and the objective global observation. We constructed a challenging dataset containing 35 third-person perspective videos, 363 first-person perspective images, and 1225 expert-annotated multiple-choice questions (three options). On this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of human subjects and several state-of-the-art large vision-language models (LVLMs). The results show that LVLMs perform significantly worse than humans on SoMi-ToM: the average accuracy gap between humans and models is 40.1% in first-person evaluation and 26.4% in third-person evaluation. This indicates that future LVLMs need to further improve their ToM capabilities in embodied, complex social interactions.

Abstract: As the performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to advance, their adoption is expanding across a wide range of domains, including the medical field. The integration of LLMs into medical applications raises critical safety concerns, particularly due to their use by users with diverse roles, e.g. patients and clinicians, and the potential for model's outputs to directly affect human health. Despite the domain-specific capabilities of medical LLMs, prior safety evaluations have largely focused only on general safety benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a safety evaluation protocol tailored to the medical domain in both patient user and clinician user perspectives, alongside general safety assessments and quantitatively analyze the safety of medical LLMs. We bridge a gap in the literature by building the PatientSafetyBench containing 466 samples over 5 critical categories to measure safety from the perspective of the patient. We apply our red-teaming protocols on the MediPhi model collection as a case study. To our knowledge, this is the first work to define safety evaluation criteria for medical LLMs through targeted red-teaming taking three different points of view - patient, clinician, and general user - establishing a foundation for safer deployment in medical domains.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a central paradigm for training large language models (LLMs) in reasoning tasks. Yet recent studies question RL's ability to incentivize reasoning capacity beyond the base model. This raises a key challenge: how can RL be adapted to solve harder reasoning problems more effectively? To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective strategy via Question Augmentation: introduce partial solutions during training to reduce problem difficulty and provide more informative learning signals. Our method, QuestA, when applied during RL training on math reasoning tasks, not only improves pass@1 but also pass@k-particularly on problems where standard RL struggles to make progress. This enables continual improvement over strong open-source models such as DeepScaleR and OpenMath Nemotron, further enhancing their reasoning capabilities. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on math benchmarks using 1.5B-parameter models: 72.50% (+10.73%) on AIME24, 62.29% (+12.79%) on AIME25, and 41.67% (+10.11%) on HMMT25.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by LLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. While recent research has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either human-written or machine-generated texts, our study focuses on characterizing these texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic levels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11 different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency length and emotionality, and we use them for characterizing human-written and machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition controls, and model release dates. Our statistical analysis reveals that human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set of features across models and domains. Both human- and machine-generated texts show stylistic diversity across domains, with human-written texts displaying greater variation in our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability among human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output text that is similarly variable, pointing to a homogenization of machine-generated texts.

Abstract: Post-training has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with human instructions, significantly enhancing their performance across a wide range of tasks. Central to this process is the quality and diversity of post-training datasets. This paper presents a review of publicly available Arabic post-training datasets on the Hugging Face Hub, organized along four key dimensions: (1) LLM Capabilities (e.g., Question Answering, Translation, Reasoning, Summarization, Dialogue, Code Generation, and Function Calling); (2) Steerability (e.g., Persona and System Prompts); (3) Alignment (e.g., Cultural, Safety, Ethics, and Fairness); and (4) Robustness. Each dataset is rigorously evaluated based on popularity, practical adoption, recency and maintenance, documentation and annotation quality, licensing transparency, and scientific contribution. Our review revealed critical gaps in the development of Arabic post-training datasets, including limited task diversity, inconsistent or missing documentation and annotation, and low adoption across the community. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of these gaps on the progress of Arabic-centric LLMs and applications while providing concrete recommendations for future efforts in Arabic post-training dataset development.

Abstract: Proficient multilingual speakers often intentionally switch languages in the middle of a conversation. Similarly, recent reasoning-focused bilingual large language models (LLMs) with strong capabilities in both languages exhibit language mixing-alternating languages within their chain of thought. Discouraging this behavior in DeepSeek-R1 was found to degrade accuracy, suggesting that language mixing may benefit reasoning. In this work, we study language switching in Chinese-English bilingual reasoning models. We identify reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training stage that leads to language mixing. We show that language mixing can enhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6 percentage points on MATH500. Additionally, a lightweight probe can be trained to predict whether a potential language switch would benefit or harm reasoning, and when used to guide decoding, increases accuracy by 2.92 percentage points. Our findings suggest that language mixing is not merely a byproduct of multilingual training, but is a strategic reasoning behavior.

Abstract: Existing document-level machine translation resources are only available for a handful of languages, mostly high-resourced ones. To facilitate the training and evaluation of document-level translation and, more broadly, long-context modeling for global communities, we create DocHPLT, the largest publicly available document-level translation dataset to date. It contains 124 million aligned document pairs across 50 languages paired with English, comprising 4.26 billion sentences. By adding pivoted alignments, practitioners can obtain 2500 additional pairs not involving English. Unlike previous reconstruction-based approaches that piece together documents from sentence-level data, we modify an existing web extraction pipeline to preserve complete document integrity from the source, retaining all content, including unaligned portions. After our preliminary experiments identify the optimal training context strategy for document-level translation, we demonstrate that LLMs fine-tuned on DocHPLT substantially outperform off-the-shelf instruction-tuned baselines, with particularly dramatic improvements for under-resourced languages. We open-source the dataset under a permissive license, providing essential infrastructure for advancing multilingual document-level translation.

<title>Speculating LLMs' Chinese Training Data Pollution from Their Tokens</title>

Abstract: Tokens are basic elements in the datasets for LLM training. It is well-known that many tokens representing Chinese phrases in the vocabulary of GPT (4o/4o-mini/o1/o3/4.5/4.1/o4-mini) are indicating contents like pornography or online gambling. Based on this observation, our goal is to locate Polluted Chinese (PoC) tokens in LLMs and study the relationship between PoC tokens' existence and training data. (1) We give a formal definition and taxonomy of PoC tokens based on the GPT's vocabulary. (2) We build a PoC token detector via fine-tuning an LLM to label PoC tokens in vocabularies by considering each token's both semantics and related contents from the search engines. (3) We study the speculation on the training data pollution via PoC tokens' appearances (token ID). Experiments on GPT and other 23 LLMs indicate that tokens widely exist while GPT's vocabulary behaves the worst: more than 23% long Chinese tokens (i.e., a token with more than two Chinese characters) are either porn or online gambling. We validate the accuracy of our speculation method on famous pre-training datasets like C4 and Pile. Then, considering GPT-4o, we speculate that the ratio of "Yui Hatano" related webpages in GPT-4o's training data is around 0.5%.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to autoregressive approaches, offering parallel sequence generation and flexible token orders. However, their inference remains slower than that of autoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and the large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this work, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer convergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by half steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and random remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99% of instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the refinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a training-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding. Specifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to go "all-in" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the confidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It integrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible overhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the number of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation quality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop sampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing speedup techniques. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/pixeli99/Prophet.

Abstract: Recent works propose complex multi-modal models that handle both time series and language, ultimately claiming high performance on complex tasks like time series reasoning and cross-modal question-answering. However, they skip evaluations of simple and important foundational tasks, which complex models should reliably master. They also lack direct, head-to-head comparisons with other popular approaches. So we ask a simple question: Can recent models even produce generic visual descriptions of time series data? In response, we propose three new tasks, posing that successful multi-modal models should be able to recognize, differentiate, and generate language descriptions of time series. We then create BEDTime, the first benchmark dataset to assess models on each task, comprising four datasets reformatted for these tasks across multiple modalities. Using BEDTime, we evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models, and find that (1) surprisingly, dedicated time series foundation models severely underperform, despite being designed for similar tasks, (2) vision-language models are quite capable, (3) language-only methods perform worst, despite many lauding their potential, and (4) all approaches are clearly fragile to a range of realistic robustness tests, indicating avenues for future work.

Abstract: Text-based person search (TBPS) enables the retrieval of person images from large-scale databases using natural language descriptions, offering critical value in surveillance applications. However, a major challenge lies in the labor-intensive process of obtaining high-quality textual annotations, which limits scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we introduce two complementary modules: Multi-Turn Text Generation (MTG) and Multi-Turn Text Interaction (MTI). MTG generates rich pseudo-labels through simulated dialogues with MLLMs, producing fine-grained and diverse visual descriptions without manual supervision. MTI refines user queries at inference time through dynamic, dialogue-based reasoning, enabling the system to interpret and resolve vague, incomplete, or ambiguous descriptions - characteristics often seen in real-world search scenarios. Together, MTG and MTI form a unified and annotation-free framework that significantly improves retrieval accuracy, robustness, and usability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior results while eliminating the need for manual captions, paving the way for scalable and practical deployment of TBPS systems.

Abstract: The auto-regressive decoding of Large Language Models (LLMs) results in significant overheads in their hardware performance. While recent research has investigated various speculative decoding techniques for multi-token generation, these efforts have primarily focused on improving processing speed such as throughput. Crucially, they often neglect other metrics essential for real-life deployments, such as memory consumption and training cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel parallel prompt decoding that requires only $0.0002$% trainable parameters, enabling efficient training on a single A100-40GB GPU in just 16 hours. Inspired by the human natural language generation process, $PPD$ approximates outputs generated at future timesteps in parallel by using multiple prompt tokens. This approach partially recovers the missing conditional dependency information necessary for multi-token generation, resulting in up to a 28% higher acceptance rate for long-range predictions. Furthermore, we present a hardware-aware dynamic sparse tree technique that adaptively optimizes this decoding scheme to fully leverage the computational capacities on different GPUs. Through extensive experiments across LLMs ranging from MobileLlama to Vicuna-13B on a wide range of benchmarks, our approach demonstrates up to 2.49$\times$ speedup and maintains a minimal runtime memory overhead of just $0.0004$%. More importantly, our parallel prompt decoding can serve as an orthogonal optimization for synergistic integration with existing speculative decoding, showing up to $1.22\times$ further speed improvement. Our code is available at https://github.com/hmarkc/parallel-prompt-decoding.

Abstract: While Transformers underpin modern large language models (LMs), there is a growing list of alternative architectures with new capabilities, promises, and tradeoffs. This makes choosing the right LM architecture challenging. Recently proposed hybrid architectures seek a best-of-all-worlds approach that reaps the benefits of all architectures. Hybrid design is difficult for two reasons: it requires manual expert-driven search, and new hybrids must be trained from scratch. We propose Manticore, a framework that addresses these challenges by automating the design of hybrid architectures while reusing pretrained models to create pretrained hybrids. Our approach augments ideas from differentiable Neural Architecture Search (NAS) by incorporating simple projectors that translate features between pretrained blocks from different architectures. We then fine-tune hybrids that combine pretrained models from different architecture families -- such as the GPT series and Mamba -- end-to-end. With Manticore, we enable LM selection without training multiple models, the construction of pretrained hybrids from existing pretrained models, and the ability to program pretrained hybrids to have certain capabilities. Manticore hybrids match existing manually designed hybrids, achieve strong performance on Long Range Arena, and improve on pretrained transformers and state space models on various natural language tasks.

Abstract: We prove rich algebraic structures of the solution space for 2-layer neural networks with quadratic activation and $L_2$ loss, trained on reasoning tasks in Abelian group (e.g., modular addition). Such a rich structure enables \emph{analytical} construction of global optimal solutions from partial solutions that only satisfy part of the loss, despite its high nonlinearity. We coin the framework as CoGS (\emph{\underline{Co}mposing \underline{G}lobal \underline{S}olutions}). Specifically, we show that the weight space over different numbers of hidden nodes of the 2-layer network is equipped with a semi-ring algebraic structure, and the loss function to be optimized consists of \emph{sum potentials}, which are ring homomorphisms, allowing partial solutions to be composed into global ones by ring addition and multiplication. Our experiments show that around $95\%$ of the solutions obtained by gradient descent match exactly our theoretical constructions. Although the global solutions constructed only required a small number of hidden nodes, our analysis on gradient dynamics shows that overparameterization asymptotically decouples training dynamics and is beneficial. We further show that training dynamics favors simpler solutions under weight decay, and thus high-order global solutions such as perfect memorization are unfavorable. The code is open sourced at https://github.com/facebookresearch/luckmatters/tree/yuandong3/ssl/real-dataset.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable successes of general-purpose neural networks, such as MLPs and Transformers, we find that they exhibit notable shortcomings in modeling and reasoning about periodic phenomena, achieving only marginal performance within the training domain and failing to generalize effectively to out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios. Periodicity is ubiquitous throughout nature and science. Therefore, neural networks should be equipped with the essential ability to model and handle periodicity. In this work, we propose FAN, a novel general-purpose neural network that effectively addresses periodicity modeling challenges while offering broad applicability similar to MLP with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Periodicity is naturally integrated into FAN's structure and computational processes by introducing the Fourier Principle. Unlike existing Fourier-based networks, which possess particular periodicity modeling abilities but face challenges in scaling to deeper networks and are typically designed for specific tasks, our approach overcomes this challenge to enable scaling to large-scale models and maintains general-purpose modeling capability. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superiority of FAN in periodicity modeling tasks and the effectiveness and generalizability of FAN across a range of real-world tasks. Moreover, we reveal that compared to existing Fourier-based networks, FAN accommodates both periodicity modeling and general-purpose modeling well.

Abstract: Various watermarking methods (``watermarkers'') have been proposed to identify LLM-generated texts; yet, due to the lack of unified evaluation platforms, many critical questions remain under-explored: i) What are the strengths/limitations of various watermarkers, especially their attack robustness? ii) How do various design choices impact their robustness? iii) How to optimally operate watermarkers in adversarial environments? To fill this gap, we systematize existing LLM watermarkers and watermark removal attacks, mapping out their design spaces. We then develop WaterPark, a unified platform that integrates 10 state-of-the-art watermarkers and 12 representative attacks. More importantly, by leveraging WaterPark, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of existing watermarkers, unveiling the impact of various design choices on their attack robustness. We further explore the best practices to operate watermarkers in adversarial environments. We believe our study sheds light on current LLM watermarking techniques while WaterPark serves as a valuable testbed to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional success in various multimodal tasks, yet their deployment is frequently limited by substantial computational demands and prolonged inference times. Given that the vision modality typically contains more comprehensive information than the text modality, resulting in encoded representations comprising an extensive number of tokens, leading to significant computational overhead due to the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism. Current token reduction methods are typically restricted to specific model architectures and often necessitate extensive retraining or fine-tuning, restricting their applicability to many state-of-the-art models. In this paper, we introduce a learning-free token reduction (LFTR) method designed for MLLMs. LFTR can be seamlessly integrated into most open-source MLLM architectures without requiring additional fine-tuning. By capitalizing on the redundancy in visual representations, our approach effectively reduces tokens while preserving the general inference performance of MLLMs. We conduct experiments on multiple MLLM architectures (LLaVA, MiniGPT, QwenVL), and our results show that LFTR achieves up to a $16\times$ reduction of visual tokens while maintaining or even enhancing performance on mainstream vision question-answering benchmarks, all in a learning-free setting. Additionally, LFTR is complementary to other acceleration techniques, such as vision encoder compression and post-training quantization, further promoting the efficient deployment of MLLMs. Our project is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/LFTR-AAAI-0528.

<title>Should You Use Your Large Language Model to Explore or Exploit?</title>

Abstract: We evaluate the ability of the current generation of large language models (LLMs) to help a decision-making agent facing an exploration-exploitation tradeoff. We use LLMs to explore and exploit in silos in various (contextual) bandit tasks. We find that while the current LLMs often struggle to exploit, in-context mitigations may be used to substantially improve performance for small-scale tasks. However even then, LLMs perform worse than a simple linear regression. On the other hand, we find that LLMs do help at exploring large action spaces with inherent semantics, by suggesting suitable candidates to explore.

<title>ReSpark: Leveraging Previous Data Reports as References to Generate New Reports with LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02329</link>

Abstract: Creating data reports is a labor-intensive task involving iterative data exploration, insight extraction, and narrative construction. A key challenge lies in composing the analysis logic-from defining objectives and transforming data to identifying and communicating insights. Manually crafting this logic can be cognitively demanding. While experienced analysts often reuse scripts from past projects, finding a perfect match for a new dataset is rare. Even when similar analyses are available online, they usually share only results or visualizations, not the underlying code, making reuse difficult. To address this, we present ReSpark, a system that leverages large language models (LLMs) to reverse-engineer analysis logic from existing reports and adapt it to new datasets. By generating draft analysis steps, ReSpark provides a warm start for users. It also supports interactive refinement, allowing users to inspect intermediate outputs, insert objectives, and revise content. We evaluate ReSpark through comparative and user studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in lowering the barrier to generating data reports without relying on existing analysis code.

Abstract: Data contamination has received increasing attention in the era of large language models (LLMs) due to their reliance on vast Internet-derived training corpora. To mitigate the risk of potential data contamination, LLM benchmarking has undergone a transformation from static to dynamic benchmarking. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of existing static to dynamic benchmarking methods aimed at reducing data contamination risks. We first examine methods that enhance static benchmarks and identify their inherent limitations. We then highlight a critical gap-the lack of standardized criteria for evaluating dynamic benchmarks. Based on this observation, we propose a series of optimal design principles for dynamic benchmarking and analyze the limitations of existing dynamic benchmarks. This survey provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of recent advancements in data contamination research, offering valuable insights and a clear guide for future research efforts. We maintain a GitHub repository to continuously collect both static and dynamic benchmarking methods for LLMs. The repository can be found at this link.

<title>Voting or Consensus? Decision-Making in Multi-Agent Debate</title>

Abstract: Much of the success of multi-agent debates depends on carefully choosing the right parameters. The decision-making protocol stands out as it can highly impact final model answers, depending on how decisions are reached. Systematic comparison of decision protocols is difficult because many studies alter multiple discussion parameters beyond the protocol. So far, it has been largely unknown how decision-making influences different tasks. This work systematically evaluates the impact of seven decision protocols (e.g., majority voting, unanimity consensus). We change only one variable at a time - the decision protocol - to analyze how different methods affect the collaboration between agents and measure differences in knowledge and reasoning tasks. Our results show that voting protocols improve performance by 13.2% in reasoning tasks and consensus protocols by 2.8% in knowledge tasks compared to other decision protocols. Increasing the number of agents improves performance, while more discussion rounds before voting reduce it. To improve decision-making by increasing answer diversity, we propose two new methods, All-Agents Drafting (AAD) and Collective Improvement (CI). Our methods improve task performance by up to 3.3% with AAD and up to 7.4% with CI. This work demonstrates the importance of decision-making in multi-agent debates beyond scaling.

Abstract: Training high-quality CLIP models typically requires enormous datasets, which limits the development of domain-specific models -- especially in areas that even the largest CLIP models do not cover well -- and drives up training costs. This poses challenges for scientific research that needs fine-grained control over the training procedure of CLIP models. In this work, we show that by employing smart web search strategies enhanced with knowledge graphs, a robust CLIP model can be trained from scratch with considerably less data. Specifically, we demonstrate that an expert foundation model for living organisms can be built using just 10M images. Moreover, we introduce EntityNet, a dataset comprising 33M images paired with 46M text descriptions, which enables the training of a generic CLIP model in significantly reduced time.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities as decision-making agents by interleaving reasoning and actions, as seen in ReAct-style frameworks. Yet, their practical deployment is constrained by high inference costs and large model sizes. We propose Structured Agent Distillation, a framework that compresses large LLM-based agents into smaller student models while preserving both reasoning fidelity and action consistency. Unlike standard token-level distillation, our method segments trajectories into {[REASON]} and {[ACT]} spans, applying segment-specific losses to align each component with the teacher's behavior. This structure-aware supervision enables compact agents to better replicate the teacher's decision process. Experiments on ALFWorld, HotPotQA-ReAct, and WebShop show that our approach consistently outperforms token-level and imitation learning baselines, achieving significant compression with minimal performance drop. Scaling and ablation results further highlight the importance of span-level alignment for efficient and deployable agents.

<title>Seeing Through Deception: Uncovering Misleading Creator Intent in Multimodal News with Vision-Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2505.15489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The impact of misinformation arises not only from factual inaccuracies but also from the misleading narratives that creators deliberately embed. Interpreting such creator intent is therefore essential for multimodal misinformation detection (MMD) and effective information governance. To this end, we introduce DeceptionDecoded, a large-scale benchmark of 12,000 image-caption pairs grounded in trustworthy reference articles, created using an intent-guided simulation framework that models both the desired influence and the execution plan of news creators. The dataset captures both misleading and non-misleading cases, spanning manipulations across visual and textual modalities, and supports three intent-centric tasks: (1) misleading intent detection, (2) misleading source attribution, and (3) creator desire inference. We evaluate 14 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) and find that they struggle with intent reasoning, often relying on shallow cues such as surface-level alignment, stylistic polish, or heuristic authenticity signals. These results highlight the limitations of current VLMs and position DeceptionDecoded as a foundation for developing intent-aware models that go beyond shallow cues in MMD.

Abstract: Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) have gained widespread adoption, yet their trustworthiness remains underexplored. Existing evaluation frameworks, designed primarily for text, fail to address unique vulnerabilities introduced by audio's acoustic properties. We identify significant trustworthiness risks in ALLMs arising from non-semantic acoustic cues, including timbre, accent, and background noise, which can manipulate model behavior. We propose AudioTrust, a comprehensive framework for systematic evaluation of ALLM trustworthiness across audio-specific risks. AudioTrust encompasses six key dimensions: fairness, hallucination, safety, privacy, robustness, and authentication. The framework implements 26 distinct sub-tasks using a curated dataset of over 4,420 audio samples from real-world scenarios, including daily conversations, emergency calls, and voice assistant interactions. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across 18 experimental configurations using human-validated automated pipelines. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source ALLMs reveals significant limitations when confronted with diverse high-risk audio scenarios, providing insights for secure deployment of audio models. Code and data are available at https://github.com/JusperLee/AudioTrust.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method for value model training on long-context reasoning traces. Compared to existing process reward models (PRMs), our method does not require a fine-grained notion of "step," which is difficult to define for long-context reasoning models. By collecting a dataset of 2.5 million reasoning traces, we train a 1.5B token-level value model and apply it to DeepSeek models for improved performance with test-time compute scaling. We find that block-wise value-guided search (VGS) with a final weighted majority vote achieves better test-time scaling than standard methods such as majority voting or best-of-n. Moreover, VGS significantly reduces the inference FLOPs required to achieve the same performance of majority voting. Our dataset, model and codebase are open-sourced.

arXiv:2505.21500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and reasoning about visual content, but significant challenges persist in tasks requiring cross-viewpoint understanding and spatial reasoning. We identify a critical limitation: current VLMs excel primarily at egocentric spatial reasoning (from the camera's perspective) but fail to generalize to allocentric viewpoints when required to adopt another entity's spatial frame of reference. We introduce ViewSpatial-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for multi-viewpoint spatial localization recognition evaluation across five distinct task types, supported by an automated 3D annotation pipeline that generates precise directional labels. Comprehensive evaluation of diverse VLMs on ViewSpatial-Bench reveals a significant performance disparity: models demonstrate reasonable performance on camera-perspective tasks but exhibit reduced accuracy when reasoning from a human viewpoint. By fine-tuning VLMs on our multi-perspective spatial dataset, we achieve an overall performance improvement of 46.24% across tasks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Our work establishes a crucial benchmark for spatial intelligence in embodied AI systems and provides empirical evidence that modeling 3D spatial relationships enhances VLMs' corresponding spatial comprehension capabilities.

arXiv:2505.21668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Practical guidance on training Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage Code Interpreter across diverse tasks remains lacking. We present R1-Code-Interpreter, an extension of a text-only LLM trained via multi-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomously generate multiple code queries during step-by-step reasoning. Unlike prior RL + tool-use efforts focused on narrow domains such as math or retrieval, we curate 144 diverse reasoning and planning tasks and show that training a general-purpose Code Interpreter across them presents significant challenges due to task heterogeneity and scarcity of effective samples. To address this, we introduce a multi-stage curriculum learning approach that partitions training samples by measured improvement potential. The RL training prioritizes samples with higher potential and gradually shifts to lower-potential ones, increasing the average RL gains from merely +3.4% to +9.3% across Qwen-2.5 models (3/7/14B). Our final model, R1-CI-14B, improves average accuracy on the 37 test tasks from 44.1% to 72.4%, outperforming text-only GPT-4o (58.6%) and GPT-4o with Code Interpreter (70.9%). Notably, R1-CI-14B also exhibits emergent self-checking behavior through code generation. Datasets, Codes, and Models are available at https://github.com/yongchao98/R1-Code-Interpreter and https://huggingface.co/yongchao98.

<title>Regularizing Learnable Feature Extraction for Automatic Speech Recognition</title>

Abstract: Neural front-ends are an appealing alternative to traditional, fixed feature extraction pipelines for automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems since they can be directly trained to fit the acoustic model. However, their performance often falls short compared to classical methods, which we show is largely due to their increased susceptibility to overfitting. This work therefore investigates regularization methods for training ASR models with learnable feature extraction front-ends. First, we examine audio perturbation methods and show that larger relative improvements can be obtained for learnable features. Additionally, we identify two limitations in the standard use of SpecAugment for these front-ends and propose masking in the short time Fourier transform (STFT)-domain as a simple but effective modification to address these challenges. Finally, integrating both regularization approaches effectively closes the performance gap between traditional and learnable features.

<title>ReLoop: "Seeing Twice and Thinking Backwards" via Closed-loop Training to Mitigate Hallucinations in Multimodal understanding</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.04943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in open-ended visual question answering, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations. These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input semantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual consistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc correction, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during training. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training framework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding in MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three complementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to "seeing twice and thinking backwards". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency Feedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description, and an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components collectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and interpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during training. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of ReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing a robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our source code and data in the camera-ready version.

<title>Taming the Tri-Space Tension: ARC-Guided Hallucination Modeling and Control for Text-to-Image Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04946</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2507.04946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in image quality and prompt fidelity, text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models continue to exhibit persistent "hallucinations", where generated content subtly or significantly diverges from the intended prompt semantics. While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts, we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence, structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this three-axis space as the Hallucination Tri-Space and introduce the Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted, axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.

Abstract: We introduce a full-stack framework that scales up reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) to long videos, leveraging reinforcement learning. We address the unique challenges of long video reasoning by integrating three critical components: (1) a large-scale dataset, LongVideo-Reason, comprising 104K long video QA pairs with high-quality reasoning annotations across diverse domains such as sports, games, and vlogs; (2) a two-stage training pipeline that extends VLMs with chain-of-thought supervised fine-tuning (CoT-SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL); and (3) a training infrastructure for long video RL, named Multi-modal Reinforcement Sequence Parallelism (MR-SP), which incorporates sequence parallelism and a vLLM-based engine tailored for long video, using cached video embeddings for efficient rollout and prefilling. In our experiments, LongVILA-R1-7B achieves strong performance on video benchmarks, reaching 65.1% and 71.1% accuracy on VideoMME without and with subtitles, respectively, and consistently outperforming LongVILA-7B across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, LongVILA-R1-7B supports processing up to 8,192 video frames per video, and configurable FPS settings. Notably, our MR-SP system achieves up to 2.1x speedup on long video RL training. In addition, we release our training system for public availability that supports RL training on various modalities (video, text, and audio), various models (VILA and Qwen series), and even image and video generation models. On a single A100 node (8 GPUs), it supports RL training on hour-long videos (e.g., 3,600 frames).

Abstract: Code generation agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the software development paradigm. Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.

<title>From Source to Target: Leveraging Transfer Learning for Predictive Process Monitoring in Organizations</title>

arXiv:2508.08061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event logs reflect the behavior of business processes that are mapped in organizational information systems. Predictive process monitoring (PPM) transforms these data into value by creating process-related predictions that provide the insights required for proactive interventions at process runtime. Existing PPM techniques require sufficient amounts of event data or other relevant resources that might not be readily available, which prevents some organizations from utilizing PPM. The transfer learning-based PPM technique presented in this paper allows organizations without suitable event data or other relevant resources to implement PPM for effective decision support. This technique is instantiated in both a real-life intra- and an inter-organizational use case, based on which numerical experiments are performed using event logs for IT service management processes. The results of the experiments suggest that knowledge of one business process can be transferred to a similar business process in the same or a different organization to enable effective PPM in the target context. The proposed technique allows organizations to benefit from transfer learning in intra- and inter-organizational settings by transferring resources such as pre-trained models within and across organizational boundaries.

Abstract: The fusion of language and vision in large vision-language models (LVLMs) has revolutionized deep learning-based object detection by enhancing adaptability, contextual reasoning, and generalization beyond traditional architectures. This in-depth review presents a structured exploration of the state-of-the-art in LVLMs, systematically organized through a three-step research review process. First, we discuss the functioning of vision language models (VLMs) for object detection, describing how these models harness natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques to revolutionize object detection and localization. We then explain the architectural innovations, training paradigms, and output flexibility of recent LVLMs for object detection, highlighting how they achieve advanced contextual understanding for object detection. The review thoroughly examines the approaches used in integration of visual and textual information, demonstrating the progress made in object detection using VLMs that facilitate more sophisticated object detection and localization strategies. This review presents comprehensive visualizations demonstrating LVLMs' effectiveness in diverse scenarios including localization and segmentation, and then compares their real-time performance, adaptability, and complexity to traditional deep learning systems. Based on the review, its is expected that LVLMs will soon meet or surpass the performance of conventional methods in object detection. The review also identifies a few major limitations of the current LVLM modes, proposes solutions to address those challenges, and presents a clear roadmap for the future advancement in this field. We conclude, based on this study, that the recent advancement in LVLMs have made and will continue to make a transformative impact on object detection and robotic applications in the future.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video), extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research.

<title>FlowRL: Matching Reward Distributions for LLM Reasoning</title>

Abstract: We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods (\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of $10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new approach, Reinforcement Learning from Augmented Generation (RLAG), to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on domain-specific tasks. LLMs often struggle with domain expertise due to limited training data representation and knowledge gaps. The proposed RLAG model iteratively samples generations and optimizes the model through tailored reward metrics to embed critical and coherent domain knowledge. By selecting generated outputs with the highest probabilities and evaluating answer accuracy and explanation rationality, RLAG significantly outperforms existing baseline approaches across medical, legal, astronomy, and current events datasets. The open-sourced code and data are available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit limited performance on domain-specific tasks due to the natural disproportionate representation of specialized information in their training data and the static nature of these datasets. Knowledge scarcity and temporal lag create knowledge gaps for domain applications. While post-training on domain datasets can embed knowledge into models, existing approaches have some limitations. Continual Pre-Training (CPT) treats all tokens in domain documents with equal importance, failing to prioritize critical knowledge points, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with question-answer pairs struggles to develop the coherent knowledge structures necessary for complex reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Reinforcement Learning from Augmented Generation (RLAG). Our approach iteratively cycles between sampling generations and optimizing the model through calculated rewards, effectively embedding critical and contextually coherent domain knowledge. We select generated outputs with the highest log probabilities as the sampling result, then compute three tailored reward metrics to guide the optimization process. To comprehensively evaluate domain expertise, we assess answer accuracy and the rationality of explanations generated for correctly answered questions. Experimental results across medical, legal, astronomy, and current events datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baseline approaches. Our code and data are open sourced at https://github.com/ChaojunNie/RLAG.

<br />Summary:
The study addresses Human Label Variation (HLV) and within-label variation in Natural Language Inference (NLI). They introduce LITEX, a taxonomy for categorizing free-text explanations in English. Annotated a subset of e-SNLI dataset with LITEX to understand annotators' reasoning and analyzed its alignment with NLI labels. Demonstrated the reliability of the taxonomy and its usefulness in explanation generation. Showed that conditioning generation on LITEX yields explanations closer to human explanations than existing strategies.

Abstract: There is increasing evidence of Human Label Variation (HLV) in Natural Language Inference (NLI), where annotators assign different labels to the same premise-hypothesis pair. However, within-label variation--cases where annotators agree on the same label but provide divergent reasoning--poses an additional and mostly overlooked challenge. Several NLI datasets contain highlighted words in the NLI item as explanations, but the same spans on the NLI item can be highlighted for different reasons, as evidenced by free-text explanations, which offer a window into annotators' reasoning. To systematically understand this problem and gain insight into the rationales behind NLI labels, we introduce LITEX, a linguistically-informed taxonomy for categorizing free-text explanations in English. Using this taxonomy, we annotate a subset of the e-SNLI dataset, validate the taxonomy's reliability, and analyze how it aligns with NLI labels, highlights, and explanations. We further assess the taxonomy's usefulness in explanation generation, demonstrating that conditioning generation on LITEX yields explanations that are linguistically closer to human explanations than those generated using only labels or highlights. Our approach thus not only captures within-label variation but also shows how taxonomy-guided generation for reasoning can bridge the gap between human and model explanations more effectively than existing strategies.

Summary: <br />
Continual Structured Knowledge Reasoning (CSKR) is a challenging task that involves translating natural language questions into structured queries based on structured knowledge. Existing continual learning approaches struggle with generalization to diverse knowledge and become inefficient as the number of tasks increases. To address these issues, a new framework called \textsc{K-DeCore} is introduced. This framework utilizes a fixed number of parameters and incorporates a knowledge decoupling mechanism to separate reasoning into task-specific and task-agnostic stages. Additionally, \textsc{K-DeCore} includes a dual-perspective memory consolidation mechanism for different stages and a structure-guided pseudo-data synthesis strategy to improve generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of \textsc{K-DeCore} over existing methods, using various large language models as backbone. <div>

Abstract: Continual Structured Knowledge Reasoning (CSKR) focuses on training models to handle sequential tasks, where each task involves translating natural language questions into structured queries grounded in structured knowledge. Existing general continual learning approaches face significant challenges when applied to this task, including poor generalization to heterogeneous structured knowledge and inefficient reasoning due to parameter growth as tasks increase. To address these limitations, we propose a novel CSKR framework, \textsc{K-DeCore}, which operates with a fixed number of tunable parameters. Unlike prior methods, \textsc{K-DeCore} introduces a knowledge decoupling mechanism that disentangles the reasoning process into task-specific and task-agnostic stages, effectively bridging the gaps across diverse tasks. Building on this foundation, \textsc{K-DeCore} integrates a dual-perspective memory consolidation mechanism for distinct stages and introduces a structure-guided pseudo-data synthesis strategy to further enhance the model's generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of \textsc{K-DeCore} over existing continual learning methods across multiple metrics, leveraging various backbone large language models.

Summary: EPiK is a new benchmark created to test physical reasoning within Korean cultural contexts, addressing the lack of diversity in existing benchmarks. It consists of 181 binary-choice problems related to various aspects of Korean culture, such as kimchi and traditional fermentation. The problems are generated authentically from Korean contexts, ensuring cultural relevance while maintaining rigorous physical reasoning standards. Evaluation results show that models specialized in Korean outperform general-purpose models of similar size, highlighting the need for culturally-aware benchmarks in language understanding tasks. The availability of EPiK provides a valuable resource for researchers and developers interested in assessing physical commonsense reasoning within specific cultural contexts. <div>

Abstract: Existing physical commonsense reasoning benchmarks predominantly focus on Western contexts, overlooking cultural variations in physical problem-solving. To address this gap, we introduce EPiK (Everyday Physics in Korean Contexts), a novel benchmark comprising 181 binary-choice problems that test physical reasoning within Korean cultural contexts, ranging from kimchi (Korean food) to traditional fermentation. EPiK is constructed using a two-stage generation and verification pipeline to create culturally-authentic problems across 9 reasoning subtasks and 84 scenarios. Unlike approaches based on simple translation, our method generates problems organically from Korean contexts while upholding rigorous physical reasoning standards. Our evaluations show that Korean-specialized models consistently outperform general-purpose models of comparable size. This performance gap highlights the limitations of culturally-agnostic models and demonstrates the critical need for culturally-aware benchmarks to truly measure language understanding. Our EPiK is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jjae/EPiK.

<div> Keywords: large language models, data filtering, token priors, corpus-level term frequency, downstream benchmarks

Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) require careful selection of training data for effective learning. While perplexity-based filtering is commonly used, it can be time-consuming and unreliable with noisy or out-of-distribution samples. This study introduces a novel data filtering method based on token priors derived from corpus-level term frequency statistics. By filtering documents using mean and standard deviation of token priors, this approach serves as a faster alternative to perplexity-based filtering without requiring model inference. The prior-based filter outperforms existing methods across 20 downstream benchmarks, reducing time costs significantly. Additionally, the method is applicable to symbolic languages like code and math, and can adapt dynamically to multilingual corpora without supervision.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are pretrained on massive web corpora, careful selection of data becomes essential to ensure effective and efficient learning. While perplexity (PPL)-based filtering has shown strong performance, it suffers from drawbacks: substantial time costs and inherent unreliability of the model when handling noisy or out-of-distribution samples. In this work, we propose a simple yet powerful alternative: a prior-based data filtering method that estimates token priors using corpus-level term frequency statistics, inspired by linguistic insights on word roles and lexical density. Our approach filters documents based on the mean and standard deviation of token priors, serving as a fast proxy to PPL while requiring no model inference. Despite its simplicity, the prior-based filter achieves the highest average performance across 20 downstream benchmarks, while reducing time cost by over 1000x compared to PPL-based filtering. We further demonstrate its applicability to symbolic languages such as code and math, and its dynamic adaptability to multilingual corpora without supervision

Summary:
DivEye is a novel detection framework designed to detect AI-generated text by capturing unpredictability fluctuation using surprisal-based features. The framework focuses on the variability in lexical and structural unpredictability found in human-authored text, distinguishing it from outputs of large language models (LLMs). DivEye outperforms existing detectors by up to 33.2% and is robust against paraphrasing and adversarial attacks. It generalizes well across domains and models, providing interpretable insights into flagged texts. It also improves the performance of existing detectors when used as an auxiliary signal. The framework points to rhythmic unpredictability as a powerful yet underexplored signal for LLM detection.

<br /><br />Summary: 
- DivEye framework detects AI-generated text using surprisal-based features 
- Focuses on variability in unpredictability found in human-authored text 
- Outperforms existing detectors by up to 33.2% 
- Robust against paraphrasing and adversarial attacks

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated text is an increasing necessity to combat misuse of LLMs in education, business compliance, journalism, and social media, where synthetic fluency can mask misinformation or deception. While prior detectors often rely on token-level likelihoods or opaque black-box classifiers, these approaches struggle against high-quality generations and offer little interpretability. In this work, we propose DivEye, a novel detection framework that captures how unpredictability fluctuates across a text using surprisal-based features. Motivated by the observation that human-authored text exhibits richer variability in lexical and structural unpredictability than LLM outputs, DivEye captures this signal through a set of interpretable statistical features. Our method outperforms existing zero-shot detectors by up to 33.2% and achieves competitive performance with fine-tuned baselines across multiple benchmarks. DivEye is robust to paraphrasing and adversarial attacks, generalizes well across domains and models, and improves the performance of existing detectors by up to 18.7% when used as an auxiliary signal. Beyond detection, DivEye provides interpretable insights into why a text is flagged, pointing to rhythmic unpredictability as a powerful and underexplored signal for LLM detection.

<div> Keywords: Large language models, reinforcement learning, credit assignment, implicit step rewards, sample efficiency<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new credit-assignment strategy, implicit step rewards for agentic reinforcement learning (iStar), to address challenges in training large language models as autonomous agents. iStar seamlessly integrates with standard RL algorithms without requiring additional rollouts or explicit step labels. It optimizes an implicit process reward model (PRM) alongside the policy model to generate implicit step rewards, which are used to compute step-level advantages for policy updates. iStar outperforms existing methods on challenging agent benchmarks such as WebShop and VisualSokoban, as well as in open-ended social interactions with unverifiable rewards in SOTOPIA. The approach demonstrates superior performance, higher sample-efficiency, and training stability compared to frontier LLMs and strong RL baselines. Additionally, iStar shows efficient exploration, generating increased rewards at both step- and episode-levels while achieving task success in fewer steps. The code for iStar will be made available soon. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.19199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly developed as autonomous agents using reinforcement learning (agentic RL) that reason and act in interactive environments. However, sparse and sometimes unverifiable rewards make it extremely challenging to assign credit when training LLM agents that serve as a policy. Recent work attempts to integrate process supervision into RL but suffers from biased annotation, reward hacking, high-variance from overly fine-grained rewards or failtures when state overlap is rare. We therefore introduce implicit step rewards for agentic RL (iStar), a general credit-assignment strategy that integrates seamlessly with standard RL algorithms without relying on additional rollouts or explicit step labels. Particularly, we alternatively optimize an implicit process reward model (PRM) with the policy model to generate implicit step rewards via a trajectory-based DPO objective. Theoretical analysis shows that this learning objective produces a step-wise reward function. Then the implicit step rewards are used to compute step-level advantages, which are combined with trajectory (or episode)-level advantages for policy updates, creating a self-reinforcing training loop. We evaluate our method on three challenging agent benchmarks, including WebShop and VisualSokoban, as well as open-ended social interactions with unverifiable rewards in SOTOPIA. Crucially, iStar shows superior performance over frontier LLMs and strong RL baselines across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with higher sample-efficiency and training stability. Further analysis also demonstrates efficient exploration by iStar with increased rewards in both step- and episode-level while maintaining fewer steps to achieve task success. Code will be available soon.

Abstract: We introduce EmbeddingGemma, a new lightweight, open text embedding model based on the Gemma 3 language model family. Our innovative training recipe strategically captures knowledge from larger models via encoder-decoder initialization and geometric embedding distillation. We improve model robustness and expressiveness with a spread-out regularizer, and ensure generalizability by merging checkpoints from varied, optimized mixtures. Evaluated on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) across multilingual, English, and code domains, EmbeddingGemma (300M) achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, it outperforms prior top models, both proprietary and open, with fewer than 500M parameters, and provides performance comparable to models double its size, offering an exceptional performance-to-cost ratio. Remarkably, this lead persists when quantizing model weights or truncating embedding outputs. This makes EmbeddingGemma particularly well-suited for low-latency and high-throughput use cases such as on-device applications. We provide ablation studies exploring our key design choices. We release EmbeddingGemma to the community to promote further research.

Summary: 
The article introduces a framework called stepwise guided policy optimization (SGPO) to address the limitation of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in updating policies when all responses within a group are incorrect. By incorporating response diversity within groups using a step-wise judge model, SGPO aims to accelerate the learning dynamics of GRPO. The proposed method is empirically validated on 9 benchmarks using different model sizes (7B, 14B, 32B), showing consistent gains in offline and online training. SGPO outperforms GRPO, especially in early and mid-training stages where all-negative-sample groups are prevalent. Unlike knowledge distillation methods, SGPO does not require judge models to produce correct answers. Overall, SGPO improves the learning efficiency of large language models trained through reinforcement learning, highlighting the importance of incorporating response diversity in model training. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.11595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). A widely adopted method, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has shown strong empirical results in training DeepSeek-R1. However, GRPO fails to update the policy when all responses within a group are incorrect (i.e., \emph{all-negative-sample} groups). This limitation underscores a key gap between artificial and human intelligence: unlike humans, who can learn from mistakes, GRPO discards these signals. Our first contribution is to introduce a simple framework that mitigates the all-negative-sample issue by incorporating response diversity within groups using a \textit{step-wise} judge model, which can be either directly trained or adapted from existing LLMs. We prove that this diversification can accelerate GRPO's learning dynamics in a simplified setting. We also empirically validate the proposed stepwise guided policy optimization (SGPO) method, demonstrating consistent gains across model sizes (7B, 14B, 32B) in offline and online training on 9 benchmarks, including base and distilled variants. Our results highlight two advantages: (i) SGPO surpasses GRPO, especially in the early and mid-training stages where all-negative-sample groups are prevalent; and (ii) SGPO does not require judge models to generate correct answers, differentiating it from knowledge distillation methods.

Summary: 
This study examines the transition from founder-led to community governance in open-source projects, focusing on 637 GitHub repositories. Using project constitutions and semantic parsing, the researchers track the evolution of roles and actions in governance structures. They find that roles and actions become more diverse and balanced over time, reflecting the growth and differentiation of governance responsibilities. Rather than a stark shift, communities gradually layer and refine their regulatory mechanisms. As projects move towards community management, they begin to regulate ecosystem-level relationships and clarify project oversight roles. This research provides a scalable pipeline for monitoring the development of community governance in open-source software, offering insights into how decentralized decision-making processes evolve over time.

This study analyzes the transition from founder-led to community governance in open-source projects. Roles and actions diversify and balance over time, reflecting the growth of governance responsibilities. Communities gradually refine regulatory mechanisms rather than undergo abrupt shifts. Projects regulating ecosystem-level relationships and defining oversight roles signal maturation in community management. The research presents a scalable pipeline for tracking community governance evolution in open-source software, shedding light on the development of decentralized decision-making processes. <div>

Abstract: Open digital public infrastructure needs community management to ensure accountability, sustainability, and robustness. Yet open-source projects often rely on centralized decision-making, and the determinants of successful community management remain unclear. We analyze 637 GitHub repositories to trace transitions from founder-led to shared governance. Specifically, we document trajectories to community governance by extracting institutional roles, actions, and deontic cues from version-controlled project constitutions (GOVERNANCE.md). With a semantic parsing pipeline, we cluster elements into broader role and action types. We find roles and actions grow, and regulation becomes more balanced, reflecting increases in governance scope and differentiation over time. Rather than shifting tone, communities grow by layering and refining responsibilities. As transitions to community management mature, projects increasingly regulate ecosystem-level relationships and add definition to project oversight roles. Overall, this work offers a scalable pipeline for tracking the growth and development of community governance regimes from open-source software's familiar default of founder-ownership.

Summary:<br /><br />Speaker verification models are crucial in various systems but their robustness to real-world challenges needs to be adequately benchmarked. Existing benchmarks do not cover all necessary conditions, hence the introduction of the SVeritas benchmark suite. This comprehensive suite evaluates models under various stressors such as noise, reverberation, age differences, and susceptibility to attacks, providing a more accurate assessment. State-of-the-art models show stability under common distortions but struggle with cross-language trials, age disparities, and codec compression. Analysis across demographic subgroups reveals differences in robustness. SVeritas aims to standardize evaluation under realistic conditions, enabling precise identification of model weaknesses and improving overall reliability of speaker verification systems. <div>

Abstract: Speaker verification (SV) models are increasingly integrated into security, personalization, and access control systems, yet their robustness to many real-world challenges remains inadequately benchmarked. These include a variety of natural and maliciously created conditions causing signal degradations or mismatches between enrollment and test data, impacting performance. Existing benchmarks evaluate only subsets of these conditions, missing others entirely. We introduce SVeritas, a comprehensive Speaker Verification tasks benchmark suite, assessing SV systems under stressors like recording duration, spontaneity, content, noise, microphone distance, reverberation, channel mismatches, audio bandwidth, codecs, speaker age, and susceptibility to spoofing and adversarial attacks. While several benchmarks do exist that each cover some of these issues, SVeritas is the first comprehensive evaluation that not only includes all of these, but also several other entirely new, but nonetheless important, real-life conditions that have not previously been benchmarked. We use SVeritas to evaluate several state-of-the-art SV models and observe that while some architectures maintain stability under common distortions, they suffer substantial performance degradation in scenarios involving cross-language trials, age mismatches, and codec-induced compression. Extending our analysis across demographic subgroups, we further identify disparities in robustness across age groups, gender, and linguistic backgrounds. By standardizing evaluation under realistic and synthetic stress conditions, SVeritas enables precise diagnosis of model weaknesses and establishes a foundation for advancing equitable and reliable speaker verification systems.

Summary:
PiERN proposes an architecture, Physically-isolated Experts Routing Network, which integrates high-precision numerical computation and reasoning tasks into large language models (LLMs) efficiently. This architecture endogenously incorporates computational capabilities by separately training experts, a text-to-computation module, and a router. During inference, the router directs computation and reasoning at the token level, allowing iterative alternation within a single chain of thought. PiERN outperforms LLM finetuning and multi-agent system approaches in accuracy, response latency, token usage, and GPU energy consumption on linear and nonlinear computation-reasoning tasks. This novel approach offers an efficient, interpretable, and scalable solution for integrating language models with complex systems. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Tasks on complex systems require high-precision numerical computation to support decisions, but current large language models (LLMs) cannot integrate such computations as an intrinsic and interpretable capability with existing architectures. Multi-agent approaches can leverage external experts, but inevitably introduce communication overhead and suffer from inefficiency caused by limited scalability. To this end, we propose Physically-isolated Experts Routing Network (PiERN), an architecture for integrating computation and reasoning. Instead of the tool-use workflows or function-calling, PiERN endogenously integrates computational capabilities into neural networks after separately training experts, a text-to-computation module, and a router. At inference, the router directs computation and reasoning at the token level, thereby enabling iterative alternation within a single chain of thought. We evaluate PiERN on representative linear and nonlinear computation-reasoning tasks against LLM finetuning and the multi-agent system approaches. Results show that the PiERN architecture achieves not only higher accuracy than directly finetuning LLMs but also significant improvements in response latency, token usage, and GPU energy consumption compared with mainstream multi-agent approaches. PiERN offers an efficient, interpretable, and scalable paradigm for interfacing language models with scientific systems.

Summary: 
Memory-QA is a new real-world task that involves answering recall questions about visual content from stored multimodal memories. The task presents challenges such as creating task-oriented memories and effectively using temporal and location information within memories. To address these challenges, the Pensieve pipeline was introduced, which includes memory-specific augmentation, time- and location-aware multi-signal retrieval, and multi-memory QA fine-tuning. A multimodal benchmark was created to demonstrate the difficulties in this task, and Pensieve was shown to outperform existing solutions by up to 14% in QA accuracy. <div>

Abstract: We introduce Memory-QA, a novel real-world task that involves answering recall questions about visual content from previously stored multimodal memories. This task poses unique challenges, including the creation of task-oriented memories, the effective utilization of temporal and location information within memories, and the ability to draw upon multiple memories to answer a recall question. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive pipeline, Pensieve, integrating memory-specific augmentation, time- and location-aware multi-signal retrieval, and multi-memory QA fine-tuning. We created a multimodal benchmark to illustrate various real challenges in this task, and show the superior performance of Pensieve over state-of-the-art solutions (up to 14% on QA accuracy).

<br />
Summary: 
Automatic content moderation in social media is important for ensuring safety, but Language Model-based classifiers can perpetuate racial and social biases. Despite efforts to address this issue, measuring the fairness of models in content moderation remains a challenge. This study introduces an unsupervised approach that benchmarks models based on their uncertainty in classifying messages annotated by vulnerable groups. By using uncertainty as a measure of bias, the study evaluates 11 models' performance against women and non-white annotators. The results reveal that some pre-trained models accurately predict labels from minority groups but lack confidence in their predictions. This highlights the importance of measuring model confidence to identify which groups are better represented and guide the debiasing process before implementing these models effectively. <div>

Abstract: Automatic content moderation is crucial to ensuring safety in social media. Language Model-based classifiers are being increasingly adopted for this task, but it has been shown that they perpetuate racial and social biases. Even if several resources and benchmark corpora have been developed to challenge this issue, measuring the fairness of models in content moderation remains an open issue. In this work, we present an unsupervised approach that benchmarks models on the basis of their uncertainty in classifying messages annotated by people belonging to vulnerable groups. We use uncertainty, computed by means of the conformal prediction technique, as a proxy to analyze the bias of 11 models against women and non-white annotators and observe to what extent it diverges from metrics based on performance, such as the $F_1$ score. The results show that some pre-trained models predict with high accuracy the labels coming from minority groups, even if the confidence in their prediction is low. Therefore, by measuring the confidence of models, we are able to see which groups of annotators are better represented in pre-trained models and lead the debiasing process of these models before their effective use.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, AccessEval, disability, biases, real-world queries

Summary:
The study introduces AccessEval, a benchmark that evaluates 21 large language models (LLMs) across 6 real-world domains and 9 disability types using neutral and disability-aware queries. Results show that LLMs tend to give more negative responses, increased stereotyping, and higher factual errors when faced with disability-aware queries compared to neutral ones. The disparities vary by domain and disability type, with hearing, speech, and mobility disabilities being disproportionately impacted. These discrepancies highlight embedded forms of ableism in model behavior. The analysis sheds light on how biases in LLMs can lead to tangible harm for disabled users in decision-making contexts. The findings emphasize the importance of mitigating bias in the development and application of LLMs to ensure fair and inclusive outcomes for all users.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse domains but often exhibit disparities in how they handle real-life queries. To systematically investigate these effects within various disability contexts, we introduce \textbf{AccessEval (Accessibility Evaluation)}, a benchmark evaluating 21 closed- and open-source LLMs across 6 real-world domains and 9 disability types using paired Neutral and Disability-Aware Queries. We evaluated model outputs with metrics for sentiment, social perception, and factual accuracy.
  Our analysis reveals that responses to disability-aware queries tend to have a more negative tone, increased stereotyping, and higher factual error compared to neutral queries. These effects show notable variation by domain and disability type, with disabilities affecting hearing, speech, and mobility disproportionately impacted. These disparities reflect persistent forms of ableism embedded in model behavior.
  By examining model performance in real-world decision-making contexts, we better illuminate how such biases can translate into tangible harms for disabled users. This framing helps bridges the gap between technical evaluation and user impact, reinforcing importance of bias mitigation in day-to-day applications.

Summary: 
RAR$^2$ is a novel framework for biomedical question answering that enhances both retrieval and reasoning capabilities. By constructing a thought process to uncover implicit knowledge requirements, RAR$^2$ guides retrieval and answer generation, addressing the limitations of existing methods in handling complex medical questions. The model is trained on a dataset of mixed preference pairs using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results show that RAR$^2$ outperforms existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) baselines, with or without fine-tuning, across various biomedical question answering datasets. Additionally, two test-time scaling strategies are introduced to further explore the capabilities of the framework. This framework demonstrates the potential of joint learning in improving the effectiveness of large language models in medical domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on diverse medical benchmarks, highlighting their potential in supporting real-world clinical tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a key approach for mitigating knowledge gaps and hallucinations by incorporating external medical information. However, RAG still struggles with complex medical questions that require intensive reasoning, as surface-level input often fails to reflect the true knowledge needs of the task. Existing methods typically focus on refining queries without explicitly modeling the reasoning process, limiting their ability to retrieve and integrate clinically relevant knowledge. In this work, we propose RAR$^2$, a joint learning framework that improves both Reasoning-Augmented Retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning. RAR$^2$ constructs a thought process to uncover implicit knowledge requirements and uses it to guide retrieval and answer generation. We build a training dataset of mixed preference pairs and apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the model. Moreover, we design two test-time scaling strategies to explore the boundaries of our framework. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RAR$^2$ across several biomedical question answering datasets, outperforming RAG baselines with or without fine-tuning.

Summary:
TRUEBench is a new benchmark designed to evaluate the real-world instruction-following capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) used as productivity assistants. Unlike existing benchmarks, TRUEBench includes input prompts in 12 languages, incorporates multilingual instructions within the same instance, and features complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios. The benchmark evaluates both explicit and implicit constraints in user requests and uses an LLM validator to refine constraints for reliability. Experimental results show that even strong models like OpenAI o1 struggle with TRUEBench, achieving only a 69.07% overall pass rate. TRUEBench provides a challenging and realistic assessment of LLMs in practical productivity settings, helping to highlight both their capabilities and limitations. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integral as productivity assistants, but existing benchmarks fall short in rigorously evaluating their real-world instruction-following capabilities. Current benchmarks often (i) lack sufficient multilinguality, (ii) fail to capture the implicit constraints inherent in user requests, and (iii) overlook the complexities of multi-turn dialogue. To address these critical gaps and provide a more realistic assessment, we introduce TRUEBench (Trustworthy Real-world Usage Evaluation Benchmark)1, a novel benchmark specifically designed for LLM-based productivity assistants. TRUEBench distinguishes itself by featuring input prompts across 12 languages, incorporating intra-instance multilingual instructions, employing rigorous evaluation criteria to capture both explicit and implicit constraints, and including complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios with both accumulating constraints and context switches. Furthermore, to ensure reliability in evaluation, we refined constraints using an LLM validator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TRUEBench presents significantly greater challenges than existing benchmarks; for instance, a strong model like OpenAI o1 achieved only a 69.07% overall pass rate. TRUEBench offers a demanding and realistic assessment of LLMs in practical productivity settings, highlighting their capabilities and limitations.

<div> Keywords: sentiment analysis, text embeddings, acoustic features, dynamic attention fusion, multimodal benchmark

Summary:
Sentiment analysis traditionally focused solely on text, neglecting non-verbal cues like vocal tones. The Dynamic Attention Fusion (DAF) framework combines text embeddings with acoustic features from a speech encoder, using adaptable attention to weigh each modality per utterance. DAF outperforms static fusion and unimodal baselines on a large multimodal benchmark without encoder fine-tuning. F1-score improved, prediction errors decreased, and ablation studies confirmed the importance of dynamic weighting for emotionally complex input modeling. By integrating verbal and non-verbal data effectively, DAF enhances sentiment prediction and has broader applications in affective computing, including emotion recognition, mental health assessment, and more natural human-computer interactions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional sentiment analysis has long been a unimodal task, relying solely on text. This approach overlooks non-verbal cues such as vocal tone and prosody that are essential for capturing true emotional intent. We introduce Dynamic Attention Fusion (DAF), a lightweight framework that combines frozen text embeddings from a pretrained language model with acoustic features from a speech encoder, using an adaptive attention mechanism to weight each modality per utterance. Without any finetuning of the underlying encoders, our proposed DAF model consistently outperforms both static fusion and unimodal baselines on a large multimodal benchmark. We report notable gains in F1-score and reductions in prediction error and perform a variety of ablation studies that support our hypothesis that the dynamic weighting strategy is crucial for modeling emotionally complex inputs. By effectively integrating verbal and non-verbal information, our approach offers a more robust foundation for sentiment prediction and carries broader impact for affective computing applications -- from emotion recognition and mental health assessment to more natural human computer interaction.

<div> sampling, autoregressive language models, diffusion language models, joint distribution, language modeling 

Summary:
- The article introduces a new approach for sampling multiple tokens from the joint distribution in a single full-model forward pass in autoregressive language models.
- Masked diffusion language models generate text by unmasking tokens out of order and potentially in parallel, resulting in a decrease in accuracy but an increase in speed.
- The proposed method involves developing a lightweight single-layer "sampler" on top of an existing large diffusion language model to approximate joint sampling.
- The sampler is trained to mimic exact joint sampling from the full model, enhancing performance in language modeling and math & coding tasks.
- When utilizing four tokens unmasked per full-model denoising step, the sampling algorithm achieves a MAUVE score of 0.87 with respect to the true joint distribution. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In autoregressive language models, each token is sampled by conditioning on all the past tokens; the overall string has thus been sampled from the correct underlying joint distribution represented by the model. In contrast, masked diffusion language models generate text by unmasking tokens out of order and potentially in parallel. Generating an overall string sampled from the correct underlying joint distribution would (again) require exactly one token unmasking in every full-model forward pass. The more tokens unmasked in parallel, the further away the string is from the true joint; this can be seen in the resulting drop in accuracy (but, increase in speed). In this paper we devise a way to {\em approximately} sample multiple tokens from the joint distribution in a single full-model forward pass; we do so by developing a new lightweight single-layer ``sampler" on top of an existing large diffusion LM. One forward pass of the full model can now be followed by multiple forward passes of only this sampler layer, to yield multiple unmasked tokens. Our sampler is trained to mimic exact joint sampling from the (frozen) full model. We show the effectiveness of our approximate joint sampling for both pretrained-only (Dream-7B-Base) and instruction-tuned (Dream-7B-Instruct) models on language modeling and math \& coding tasks. When four tokens are unmasked for each full-model denoising step, our sampling algorithm achieves a MAUVE score of 0.87 (vs marginal baseline of 0.31) with respect to the true joint distribution.

<div> Keywords: Language models, Activation steering, Post-training methods, Automated methods, Performance improvement<br />
Summary: 
Painless Activation Steering (PAS) is introduced as a fully automated method for controlling language models (LMs) post-training without the need for manual intervention. This method aims to improve performance for behavior tasks with open-weight models. PAS, specifically the introspective variant iPAS, shows significant causal steering effects on Bias, Morality, and Alignment tasks. PAS is shown to provide additional gains on top of In-Context Learning (ICL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). The method constructs a fast and lightweight activation vector that can be easily trained, stored, and activated when needed. Results from evaluating PAS on multiple tasks suggest its potential as a practical and automated option for LM post-training, highlighting its benefits for certain tasks while also identifying areas where it may not be as effective. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language models (LMs) are typically post-trained for desired capabilities and behaviors via weight-based or prompt-based steering, but the former is time-consuming and expensive, and the latter is not precisely controllable and often requires manual trial-and-error. While activation steering (AS) promises a cheap, fast, and controllable alternative to the two existing post-training methods, current AS techniques require hand-crafted prompt pairs or labor-intensive feature annotation, making them more inconvenient than the plug-and-play methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We introduce Painless Activation Steering (PAS), a family of fully automated methods that make AS readily usable with any given labeled dataset, with no need for prompt construction, feature labeling, or human intervention. We evaluate PAS on three open-weight models (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-8B, and Nous-Hermes-2) and 18 tasks; we find that PAS reliably improves performance for behavior tasks, but not for intelligence-oriented tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the strongest causal steering effects (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, and 34.8% on Alignment). We also show PAS delivers additional gains on top of In-Context Learning (ICL) and SFT. PAS constructs a fast, lightweight activation vector that can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. Our results provide a characterization of where AS helps, where it fails, and how to deploy it as a practical, automated LM post-training option.

Summary:
ambiguity is a significant challenge in real-world multi-hop question answering, as it requires resolving ambiguity at every step. Current Large Language Models struggle with this task, exploring wrong reasoning paths and producing incomplete answers. To address this, the MIRAGE benchmark is introduced, containing high-quality examples of ambiguous multi-hop questions. The benchmark categorizes ambiguity into syntactic, general, and semantic types and highlights the difficulty of resolving ambiguity in multi-step inference. A multi-agent framework called CLARION is proposed as a robust baseline, outperforming existing approaches on MIRAGE. This framework sets the foundation for more adaptive and robust reasoning systems in the future. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world Multi-hop Question Answering (QA) often involves ambiguity that is inseparable from the reasoning process itself. This ambiguity creates a distinct challenge, where multiple reasoning paths emerge from a single question, each requiring independent resolution. Since each sub-question is ambiguous, the model must resolve ambiguity at every step. Thus, answering a single question requires handling multiple layers of ambiguity throughout the reasoning chain. We find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle in this setting, typically exploring wrong reasoning paths and producing incomplete answers. To facilitate research on multi-hop ambiguity, we introduce MultI-hop Reasoning with AmbiGuity Evaluation for Illusory Questions (MIRAGE), a benchmark designed to analyze and evaluate this challenging intersection of ambiguity interpretation and multi-hop reasoning. MIRAGE contains 1,142 high-quality examples of ambiguous multi-hop questions, categorized under a taxonomy of syntactic, general, and semantic ambiguity, and curated through a rigorous multi-LLM verification pipeline. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models struggle on MIRAGE, confirming that resolving ambiguity combined with multi-step inference is a distinct and significant challenge. To establish a robust baseline, we propose CLarifying Ambiguity with a Reasoning and InstructiON (CLARION), a multi-agent framework that significantly outperforms existing approaches on MIRAGE, paving the way for more adaptive and robust reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong capabilities in generating machine learning (ML) code, enabling end-to-end pipeline construction from natural language instructions. However, existing benchmarks for ML code generation are mainly restricted to English, overlooking the global and multilingual nature of ML research and practice. To address this gap, we present ML2B, the first benchmark for evaluating multilingual ML code generation. ML2B consists of 30 Kaggle competitions translated into 13 natural languages, covering tabular, text, and image data types, with structured metadata and validated human-reviewed translations. For evaluation, we employ AIDE, an automated framework for end-to-end assessment of data science pipelines, and provide insights into cross-lingual model performance. Our results reveal substantial 15-45% performance degradation on non-English tasks, highlighting critical challenges in multilingual representation learning for code generation.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges in distinguishing between real and synthetic Arabic speech due to the increasing use of generative text-to-speech (TTS) models. It introduces a new multi-dialect Arabic spoofed speech dataset and evaluates different TTS models for their performance in creating realistic synthetic speech samples. The study involves training classifiers using embedding-based methods, classical machine learning algorithms, and the RawNet2 architecture. Results show that FishSpeech is the top-performing TTS model for Arabic voice cloning. However, relying on a single TTS model for dataset creation may limit generalizability. The evaluation pipeline includes human ratings based on Mean Opinion Score and Automatic Speech Recognition to measure Word Error Rate. This research fills the gap in Arabic spoof detection and highlights the importance of considering multiple models for dataset creation in order to achieve robustness and generalizability. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.22808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of generative text-to-speech models, distinguishing between real and synthetic speech has become challenging, especially for Arabic that have received limited research attention. Most spoof detection efforts have focused on English, leaving a significant gap for Arabic and its many dialects. In this work, we introduce the first multi-dialect Arabic spoofed speech dataset. To evaluate the difficulty of the synthesized audio from each model and determine which produces the most challenging samples, we aimed to guide the construction of our final dataset either by merging audios from multiple models or by selecting the best-performing model, we conducted an evaluation pipeline that included training classifiers using two approaches: modern embedding-based methods combined with classifier heads; classical machine learning algorithms applied to MFCC features; and the RawNet2 architecture. The pipeline further incorporated the calculation of Mean Opinion Score based on human ratings, as well as processing both original and synthesized datasets through an Automatic Speech Recognition model to measure the Word Error Rate. Our results demonstrate that FishSpeech outperforms other TTS models in Arabic voice cloning on the Casablanca corpus, producing more realistic and challenging synthetic speech samples. However, relying on a single TTS for dataset creation may limit generalizability.

Summary:
In the field of radiology report generation, the use of advanced medical image analysis and accurate text generation is crucial. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise, their supervised fine-tuning (SFT) objective may not be aligned with clinical effectiveness. To address this, the authors introduce EditGRPO, a mixed-policy reinforcement learning algorithm tailored to optimize report generation with clinically relevant rewards. By combining on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance through detailed corrections during training, EditGRPO outperforms traditional SFT and vanilla GRPO approaches. The algorithm shows significant improvements in key metrics across four chest X-ray report generation datasets, with superior generalization to unseen datasets. This innovative approach enhances the performance and clinical relevance of radiology report generation models.<br /><br />Summary: <br />

Abstract: Radiology report generation requires advanced medical image analysis, effective temporal reasoning, and accurate text generation. Although recent innovations, particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), have shown improved performance, their supervised fine-tuning (SFT) objective is not explicitly aligned with clinical efficacy. In this work, we introduce EditGRPO, a mixed-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed specifically to optimize the generation through clinically motivated rewards. EditGRPO integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts. This mixed-policy approach addresses the exploration dilemma and sampling efficiency issues typically encountered in RL. Applied to a Qwen2.5-VL-3B MLLM initialized with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), EditGRPO outperforms both SFT and vanilla GRPO baselines, achieving an average improvement of 3.4% in CheXbert, GREEN, Radgraph, and RATEScore metrics across four major chest X-ray report generation datasets. Notably, EditGRPO also demonstrates superior out-of-domain generalization, with an average performance gain of 5.9% on unseen datasets.

<div> Keywords: Reinforcement Learning, Critique Reinforcement Learning, Critique-Coder, reasoning models, coding datasets 

Summary: 
- Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been effective in training models for generating responses but lacks mechanisms for critique and reflection.
- Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL) is proposed where models generate critiques for given (question, solution) pairs.
- The reward in CRL is based on the alignment of the generated critique with the ground-truth judgment.
- The Critique-Coder model, trained on a hybrid of RL and CRL, outperforms RL-only models on various benchmarks.
- Critique-Coder shows superior performance on coding tasks and logic reasoning tasks, indicating enhanced general reasoning abilities through the application of CRL.
  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a popular training paradigm, particularly when paired with reasoning models. While effective, it primarily focuses on generating responses and lacks mechanisms to explicitly foster critique or reflection. Several recent studies, like Critique-Fine-Tuning (CFT) and Critique-Guided-Distillation (CGD) have shown the benefits of explicitly teaching LLMs how to critique. Motivated by them, we propose Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL), where the model is tasked with generating a critique for a given (question, solution) pair. The reward is determined solely by whether the final judgment label $c \in \{\texttt{True}, \texttt{False}\}$ of the generated critique aligns with the ground-truth judgment $c^*$. Building on this point, we introduce \textsc{Critique-Coder}, which is trained on a hybrid of RL and CRL by substituting 20\% of the standard RL data with CRL data. We fine-tune multiple models (\textsc{Critique-Coder}) and evaluate them on different benchmarks to show their advantages over RL-only models. We show that \textsc{Critique-Coder} consistently outperforms RL-only baselines on all the evaluated benchmarks. Notably, our \textsc{Critique-Coder-8B} can reach over 60\% on LiveCodeBench (v5), outperforming other reasoning models like DeepCoder-14B and GPT-o1. Beyond code generation, \textsc{Critique-Coder} also demonstrates enhanced general reasoning abilities, as evidenced by its better performance on logic reasoning tasks from the BBEH dataset. This indicates that the application of CRL on coding datasets enhances general reasoning and critique abilities, which are transferable across a broad range of tasks. Hence, we believe that CRL works as a great complement to standard RL for LLM reasoning.

Summary:
(1) ChatInject attack exploits vulnerabilities in large language models by formatting malicious payloads to mimic native chat templates, achieving higher attack success rates compared to traditional methods. Multi-turn dialogue variants show particularly strong performance.
(2) Chat-template-based payloads demonstrate strong transferability across models and remain effective even against closed-source LLMs.
(3) Existing prompt-based defenses are largely ineffective against this attack approach, especially against Multi-turn variants. These findings highlight vulnerabilities in current agent systems. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing deployment of large language model (LLM) based agents that interact with external environments has created new attack surfaces for adversarial manipulation. One major threat is indirect prompt injection, where attackers embed malicious instructions in external environment output, causing agents to interpret and execute them as if they were legitimate prompts. While previous research has focused primarily on plain-text injection attacks, we find a significant yet underexplored vulnerability: LLMs' dependence on structured chat templates and their susceptibility to contextual manipulation through persuasive multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we introduce ChatInject, an attack that formats malicious payloads to mimic native chat templates, thereby exploiting the model's inherent instruction-following tendencies. Building on this foundation, we develop a persuasion-driven Multi-turn variant that primes the agent across conversational turns to accept and execute otherwise suspicious actions. Through comprehensive experiments across frontier LLMs, we demonstrate three critical findings: (1) ChatInject achieves significantly higher average attack success rates than traditional prompt injection methods, improving from 5.18% to 32.05% on AgentDojo and from 15.13% to 45.90% on InjecAgent, with multi-turn dialogues showing particularly strong performance at average 52.33% success rate on InjecAgent, (2) chat-template-based payloads demonstrate strong transferability across models and remain effective even against closed-source LLMs, despite their unknown template structures, and (3) existing prompt-based defenses are largely ineffective against this attack approach, especially against Multi-turn variants. These findings highlight vulnerabilities in current agent systems.

<div> Keywords: knowledge-grounded conversations, retrieval-based dialogue systems, response selection model, relevant parts detection, multi-turn dialogue

Summary:
The paper introduces a Response Selection Model for multi-turn dialogue, aimed at improving the performance of retrieval-based dialogue systems by effectively detecting relevant parts of the context and knowledge collection. The proposed model, RSM-DCK, utilizes word-level and utterance-level semantics to pre-select relevant context and knowledge based on the recent context query. The response candidate then interacts with the selected context and knowledge for matching. The fused representation of the context and response candidate is used to confidently post-select relevant parts of the knowledge collection. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets show that RSM-DCK outperforms existing methods in detecting relevant context and knowledge for response selection. The model addresses the issue of excessive useless information in the context and knowledge, ultimately improving the dialogue system's performance in open domain conversations. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, knowledge-grounded conversations in the open domain gain great attention from researchers. Existing works on retrieval-based dialogue systems have paid tremendous efforts to utilize neural networks to build a matching model, where all of the context and knowledge contents are used to match the response candidate with various representation methods. Actually, different parts of the context and knowledge are differentially important for recognizing the proper response candidate, as many utterances are useless due to the topic shift. Those excessive useless information in the context and knowledge can influence the matching process and leads to inferior performance. To address this problem, we propose a multi-turn \textbf{R}esponse \textbf{S}election \textbf{M}odel that can \textbf{D}etect the relevant parts of the \textbf{C}ontext and \textbf{K}nowledge collection (\textbf{RSM-DCK}). Our model first uses the recent context as a query to pre-select relevant parts of the context and knowledge collection at the word-level and utterance-level semantics. Further, the response candidate interacts with the selected context and knowledge collection respectively. In the end, The fused representation of the context and response candidate is utilized to post-select the relevant parts of the knowledge collection more confidently for matching. We test our proposed model on two benchmark datasets. Evaluation results indicate that our model achieves better performance than the existing methods, and can effectively detect the relevant context and knowledge for response selection.

<div> Paradigm, Implicit in-context learning, Large Language Models, Zero-shot cost, In-Context Routing <br />
Summary: In this article, the authors introduce In-Context Routing (ICR) as a novel implicit method for in-context learning that operates at the attention logits level. Unlike existing approaches that rely on labeled demonstrations or task-specific alignment, ICR internalizes generalizable ICL patterns and utilizes a learnable input-conditioned router to modulate attention logits. This enables a train-once-and-reuse framework, improving performance across diverse domains and multiple Large Language Models. ICR outperforms prior implicit ICL methods that require task-specific retrieval or training and shows robust generalization to out-of-domain tasks. These results highlight the potential of ICR to enhance the practical value of in-context learning. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.22854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit in-context learning (ICL) has newly emerged as a promising paradigm that simulates ICL behaviors in the representation space of Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to attain few-shot performance at zero-shot cost. However, existing approaches largely rely on injecting shift vectors into residual flows, which are typically constructed from labeled demonstrations or task-specific alignment. Such designs fall short of utilizing the structural mechanisms underlying ICL and suffer from limited generalizability. To address this, we propose In-Context Routing (ICR), a novel implicit ICL method that internalizes generalizable ICL patterns at the attention logits level. It extracts reusable structural directions that emerge during ICL and employs a learnable input-conditioned router to modulate attention logits accordingly, enabling a train-once-and-reuse framework. We evaluate ICR on 12 real-world datasets spanning diverse domains and multiple LLMs. The results show that ICR consistently outperforms prior implicit ICL methods that require task-specific retrieval or training, while demonstrating robust generalization to out-of-domain tasks where existing methods struggle. These findings position ICR to push the boundary of ICL's practical value.

<div> cognitive biases, Large Language Models, evaluation framework, decision scenarios, model size

Summary: 
The study evaluates cognitive biases in Large Language Models (LLMs) through a large-scale analysis of 45 LLMs and over 2.8 million responses. Eight well-established biases are examined, including anchoring, availability, confirmation, and framing. LLMs exhibit bias-consistent behavior in 17.8-57.3% of cases, with model size and prompt specificity impacting bias susceptibility. Larger models (>32B parameters) can reduce bias in 39.5% of instances, while higher prompt detail decreases biases by up to 14.9%, except for Overattribution where it exacerbates bias by 8.8%. The study introduces a new evaluation framework using multiple-choice tasks and a hand-curated dataset of 220 decision scenarios. Prompt variations are generated from human-authored scenario templates, enabling a comprehensive analysis of bias prevalence in LLM decision-making. <div>
arXiv:2509.22856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded in real-world decision-making processes, it becomes crucial to examine the extent to which they exhibit cognitive biases. Extensively studied in the field of psychology, cognitive biases appear as systematic distortions commonly observed in human judgments. This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of eight well-established cognitive biases across 45 LLMs, analyzing over 2.8 million LLM responses generated through controlled prompt variations. To achieve this, we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on multiple-choice tasks, hand-curate a dataset of 220 decision scenarios targeting fundamental cognitive biases in collaboration with psychologists, and propose a scalable approach for generating diverse prompts from human-authored scenario templates. Our analysis shows that LLMs exhibit bias-consistent behavior in 17.8-57.3% of instances across a range of judgment and decision-making contexts targeting anchoring, availability, confirmation, framing, interpretation, overattribution, prospect theory, and representativeness biases. We find that both model size and prompt specificity play a significant role on bias susceptibility as follows: larger size (>32B parameters) can reduce bias in 39.5% of cases, while higher prompt detail reduces most biases by up to 14.9%, except in one case (Overattribution), which is exacerbated by up to 8.8%.

<div> graph-based approach, lexicons, document-level readability, Arabic, BAREC Shared Task

Summary:
A graph-based approach enriched with lexicons is proposed for predicting document-level readability in Arabic, as part of the Constrained Track of the BAREC Shared Task 2025. Each document is modeled as a sentence-level graph where nodes represent sentences and lemmas, with edges capturing linguistic relationships. Sentence nodes are augmented with features from the SAMER lexicon and contextual embeddings from an Arabic transformer model. A graph neural network (GNN) and transformer sentence encoder are trained independently and combined via late fusion for predictions. Sentence-level outputs are aggregated using max pooling to determine the most difficult sentence for document-level prediction. Results indicate the hybrid approach outperforms standalone GNN or transformer branches for multiple readability metrics. While fusion offers advantages at the document level, the GNN-only approach excels in precise sentence-level readability prediction. <div>

Abstract: We present a graph-based approach enriched with lexicons to predict document-level readability in Arabic, developed as part of the Constrained Track of the BAREC Shared Task 2025. Our system models each document as a sentence-level graph, where nodes represent sentences and lemmas, and edges capture linguistic relationships such as lexical co-occurrence and class membership. Sentence nodes are enriched with features from the SAMER lexicon as well as contextual embeddings from the Arabic transformer model. The graph neural network (GNN) and transformer sentence encoder are trained as two independent branches, and their predictions are combined via late fusion at inference. For document-level prediction, sentence-level outputs are aggregated using max pooling to reflect the most difficult sentence. Experimental results show that this hybrid method outperforms standalone GNN or transformer branches across multiple readability metrics. Overall, the findings highlight that fusion offers advantages at the document level, but the GNN-only approach remains stronger for precise prediction of sentence-level readability.

<div> Framework, Language models, Emotions, Reasoning, Feedback
Summary: The article introduces HEART, a framework that leverages emotionally-driven prompts to guide language models in self-correction during test-time scaling. Inspired by psychological research on emotions impacting cognitive performance, HEART provides feedback using concise, emotionally charged phrases based on six universal emotions. This approach leads to deeper reasoning and improved accuracy on reasoning benchmarks when guided by an oracle verifier. However, the framework struggles to consistently harness these gains in a verifier-free setting, highlighting a challenge for future work. The study suggests that the future of machine reasoning may involve not only refining logic but also understanding and utilizing emotions within models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time scaling has shown considerable success in improving the performance of language models on complex reasoning tasks without requiring fine-tuning. However, current strategies such as self-reflection primarily focus on logical or structural refinement. They do not leverage the guiding potential of affective feedback. Inspired by psychological research showing that emotions can modulate cognitive performance, we introduce HEART--a novel framework that uses emotionally-driven prompts for iterative self-correction. HEART provides feedback on a model's incorrect response using a curated set of concise, emotionally charged phrases based on the six universal emotions categorized by Dr. Paul Ekman. By systematically varying the emotional tone of the feedback across iterations, our method guides the model to escape flawed reasoning paths and explore more promising alternatives. We evaluate our framework on challenging reasoning benchmarks including OlympiadBench, Humanity's Last Exam, and SimpleQA. Our results reveal a significant new phenomenon: when guided by an oracle verifier, this affective iteration protocol unlocks significantly deeper reasoning, leading to consistent and substantial increases in accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines with the same verifier. However, we also identify a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. In a verifier-free setting, it struggles to harness these gains consistently, highlighting as a key challenge for future work. Our findings suggest that the next frontier in machine reasoning may lie not just in refining logic, but also in understanding and leveraging the `HEART' of the models.

Summary: This article explores the integration of Theory of Mind (ToM) in Language Model based dialogue agents. The authors demonstrate that prompting models to generate mental states between dialogue turns improves dialogue effectiveness. They introduce ToMAgent (ToMA), a ToM-focused dialogue agent trained to use ToM with dialogue lookahead to achieve dialogue goals efficiently. Experiments on the Sotopia benchmark show the effectiveness of ToMA over baselines. ToMA exhibits strategic, goal-oriented reasoning behaviors, enabling long-horizon adaptation and better relationships with partners.

Abstract: Theory of Mind (ToM)-an understanding of the mental states of others-is a key aspect of human social intelligence, yet, chatbots and LLM-based social agents do not typically integrate it. In this work, we demonstrate that LLMs that explicitly use ToM get better at dialogue, achieving goals more effectively. After showing that simply prompting models to generate mental states between dialogue turns already provides significant benefit, we further introduce ToMAgent (ToMA), a ToM-focused dialogue agent. ToMA is trained by pairing ToM with dialogue lookahead to produce mental states that are maximally useful for achieving dialogue goals. Experiments on the Sotopia interactive social evaluation benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over a range of baselines. Comprehensive analysis shows that ToMA exhibits more strategic, goal-oriented reasoning behaviors, which enable long-horizon adaptation, while maintaining better relationships with their partners. Our results suggest a step forward in integrating ToM for building socially intelligent LLM agents.

Abstract: This paper presents Extract-0, a 7-billion parameter language model specifically optimized for document information extraction that achieves performance exceeding models with parameter counts several orders of magnitude larger. Through a novel combination of synthetic data generation, supervised fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), Extract-0 achieves a mean reward of 0.573 on a benchmark of 1,000 diverse document extraction tasks, outperforming GPT-4.1 (0.457), o3 (0.464), and GPT-4.1-2025 (0.459). The training methodology employs a memory-preserving synthetic data generation pipeline that produces 280,128 training examples from diverse document sources, followed by parameterefficient fine-tuning that modifies only 0.53% of model weights (40.4M out of 7.66B parameters). The reinforcement learning phase introduces a novel semantic similarity-based reward function that handles the inherent ambiguity in information extraction tasks. This research demonstrates that task-specific optimization can yield models that surpass general-purpose systems while requiring substantially fewer computational resource.

<div> drugs, medication, language model, performance, benchmarking<br />
Summary:<br />
- Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4o were evaluated for their ability to recommend medication regimens using three benchmarking tests. 
- GPT-4o performed poorly in matching drug names to correct formulations, often omitting or hallucinating formulations. 
- Accuracy decreased with medications having more formulations. 
- The model was inconsistent in identifying drug-drug interactions, with better performance when using web search compared to internal knowledge. 
- Allowing a web search worsened performance for medications with no interactions. 
- GPT-4o had moderate success in preparing medication order sentences, with errors in medication names or abbreviations. 
- The study emphasized the need for domain-specific training and comprehensive evaluation frameworks for improving model performance in the medical domain. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) can be useful in diagnosing medical conditions, but few studies have evaluated their consistency in recommending appropriate medication regimens. The purpose of this evaluation was to test GPT-4o on three medication benchmarking tests including mapping a drug name to its correct formulation, identifying drug-drug interactions using both its internal knowledge and using a web search, and preparing a medication order sentence after being given the medication name. Methods: Using GTP-4o three experiments were completed. Accuracy was quantified by computing cosine similarity on TF-IDF vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and ROUGE-1/ROUGE-L F1 between each response and its reference string or by manual evaluation by clinicians. Results: GPT-4o performed poorly on drug-formulation matching, with frequent omissions of available drug formulations (mean 1.23 per medication) and hallucinations of formulations that do not exist (mean 1.14 per medication). Only 49% of tested medications were correctly matched to all available formulations. Accuracy was decreased for medications with more formulations (p<0.0001). GPT-4o was also inconsistent at identifying drug-drug-interactions, although it had better performance with the search-augmented assessment compared to its internal knowledge (54.7% vs. 69.2%, p=0.013). However, allowing a web-search worsened performance when there was no drug-drug interaction (median % correct 100% vs. 40%, p<0.001). Finally, GPT-4o performed moderately with preparing a medication order sentence, with only 65.8% of medication order sentences containing no medication or abbreviation errors. Conclusions: Model performance was overall poor for all tests. This highlights the need for domain-specific training through clinician-annotated datasets and a comprehensive evaluation framework for benchmarking performance.

Summary: 
Generative AI has advanced the ability to transform content between different mediums, particularly in storytelling. This study focuses on narrative scene illustration, using Language Models (LLMs) to prompt text-to-image models for generating scene illustrations from story text. The researchers applied this pipeline to a story corpus, creating the SceneIllustrations dataset through human annotation for illustration quality assessment. The dataset serves as a resource for future cross-modal narrative transformation research. Findings show LLMs effectively verbalize scene knowledge from story text, aiding in illustration generation and evaluation. The study highlights the impact of LLMs in bridging text and image modalities for storytelling applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI has established the opportunity to readily transform content from one medium to another. This capability is especially powerful for storytelling, where visual illustrations can illuminate a story originally expressed in text. In this paper, we focus on the task of narrative scene illustration, which involves automatically generating an image depicting a scene in a story. Motivated by recent progress on text-to-image models, we consider a pipeline that uses LLMs as an interface for prompting text-to-image models to generate scene illustrations given raw story text. We apply variations of this pipeline to a prominent story corpus in order to synthesize illustrations for scenes in these stories. We conduct a human annotation task to obtain pairwise quality judgments for these illustrations. The outcome of this process is the SceneIllustrations dataset, which we release as a new resource for future work on cross-modal narrative transformation. Through our analysis of this dataset and experiments modeling illustration quality, we demonstrate that LLMs can effectively verbalize scene knowledge implicitly evoked by story text. Moreover, this capability is impactful for generating and evaluating illustrations.

<div> Keywords: pretraining, induction circuit, in-context learning, synthetic data, language modeling

Summary: 
The study investigates whether explicitly exercising the induction circuit during pretraining improves in-context learning (ICL). They introduce Bi-Induct, a curriculum injecting synthetic forward-copy and backward-copy data into the pretraining stream. Results show that early induction circuit activation does not directly enhance ICL. While Bi-Induct accelerates induction-head emergence at small scales, it does not consistently improve generalization. Larger natural-only models develop broader induction heads without explicit induction patterns. Anti-induction data does not elicit meaningful activation. Larger models can absorb non-natural patterns with minimal cost. Ablating the top 2% of induction heads degrades ICL, indicating their importance. Different circuit utilization is observed in Bi-Induct variants. The study emphasizes the need for mechanism-aware pretraining diagnostics and data mixtures that foster load-bearing structure, not just present structure. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.22947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Does explicitly exercising the induction circuit during pretraining improve in-context learning (ICL), or is natural text sufficient when compute is held constant (iso-FLOPs)? To test whether targeted synthetic data can accelerate induction-head emergence and enhance ICL, we introduce Bi-Induct, a lightweight curriculum that injects forward-copy (Induction), backward-copy (Anti), or a balanced mix into the pretraining stream. We train models from 0.13B to 1B parameters under iso-FLOPs, evaluating (i) few-shot ICL benchmarks, (ii) head-level telemetry, and (iii) held-out language modeling perplexity. Our findings challenge the assumption that early induction circuit activation directly improves ICL. While Bi-Induct accelerates induction-head emergence at small scales, this does not consistently yield stronger generalization. On standard LM benchmarks, Bi-Induct matches natural-only training; on function-style ICL probes, the 1B natural-only performs best. Stress tests (e.g., label permutation, HITS@1 vs. HITS@3, 1 vs. 10 shots) preserve these trends. Telemetry shows larger natural-only models develop broader, earlier induction heads without explicit induction patterns. Anti-induction data fails to elicit meaningful activation. Perplexity penalties from synthetic data shrink with scale, suggesting larger models can absorb non-natural patterns with minimal cost. Crucially, ablating the top 2% of induction heads degrades ICL more than random ablations, especially for natural-only models, indicating more centralized, load-bearing circuits. Bi-Induct variants exhibit more redundant induction activity, implying different circuit utilization. Overall, inducing activation is not sufficient: ICL gains depend on these circuits becoming functionally necessary. These results underscore mechanism-aware pretraining diagnostics and data mixtures that foster load-bearing, not merely present, structure.

<br />
Summary:
Self-supervised speech models trained for word recognition in noisy environments use global linear geometry to represent phonological and morphological phenomena in English noun and verb inflections. These models do not directly track phonological or morphological units, but instead capture the regular distributional relationships among word pairs in the English lexicon, often related to morphological inflection. The findings suggest potential representational strategies for human spoken word recognition, challenging the traditional notion of distinct linguistic representations for phonology and morphology. This study sheds light on how these models leverage geometric structures to link words and their inflected forms, offering insights into the efficiency of self-supervised speech recognition systems in understanding linguistic patterns.

Abstract: Self-supervised speech models can be trained to efficiently recognize spoken words in naturalistic, noisy environments. However, we do not understand the types of linguistic representations these models use to accomplish this task. To address this question, we study how S3M variants optimized for word recognition represent phonological and morphological phenomena in frequent English noun and verb inflections. We find that their representations exhibit a global linear geometry which can be used to link English nouns and verbs to their regular inflected forms.
  This geometric structure does not directly track phonological or morphological units. Instead, it tracks the regular distributional relationships linking many word pairs in the English lexicon -- often, but not always, due to morphological inflection. These findings point to candidate representational strategies that may support human spoken word recognition, challenging the presumed necessity of distinct linguistic representations of phonology and morphology.

<div> Keywords: Table Question Answering, structured databases, semi-structured tables, representation, model performance

Summary:
The study examines the impact of table representation on Table Question Answering (Table QA) performance by controlling for content while varying structure. Structured and semi-structured tables are generated using a verbalization pipeline for direct comparison across modeling paradigms. A diagnostic benchmark is introduced with splits based on table size, join requirements, query complexity, and schema quality for detailed analysis. Results show trade-offs among SQL-based methods, LLMs, and hybrid approaches, with hybrid approaches showing promise, especially under noisy schemas. The effects of representation are amplified with larger tables and more complex queries, highlighting the importance of representation in shaping Table QA performance. These findings offer actionable insights for model selection and design, laying the groundwork for robust hybrid approaches suitable for diverse real-world data formats.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Table Question Answering (Table QA) in real-world settings must operate over both structured databases and semi-structured tables containing textual fields. However, existing benchmarks are tied to fixed data formats and have not systematically examined how representation itself affects model performance. We present the first controlled study that isolates the role of table representation by holding content constant while varying structure. Using a verbalization pipeline, we generate paired structured and semi-structured tables, enabling direct comparisons across modeling paradigms. To support detailed analysis, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark with splits along table size, join requirements, query complexity, and schema quality. Our experiments reveal consistent trade-offs: SQL-based methods achieve high accuracy on structured inputs but degrade on semi-structured data, LLMs exhibit flexibility but reduced precision, and hybrid approaches strike a balance, particularly under noisy schemas. These effects intensify with larger tables and more complex queries. Ultimately, no single method excels across all conditions, and we highlight the central role of representation in shaping Table QA performance. Our findings provide actionable insights for model selection and design, paving the way for more robust hybrid approaches suited for diverse real-world data formats.

Abstract: We introduce ADAM (A Diverse Archive of Mankind), a framework for evaluating and improving multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in biographical reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically examine LLM capabilities in biography, a critical yet underexplored dimension of factual knowledge. At its core, AdamDB is a multilingual and multimodal dataset covering over 4 million individuals across geography, time, and profession, while AdamBench provides cognitively structured evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy, spanning six reasoning levels in both English and native languages. To address hallucinations, particularly for lesser-known individuals, we propose AdamRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation system tailored to biographical contexts. Experiments show that AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits closed-source ones, with the largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval. ADAM establishes the first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally grounded biographical evaluation, advancing the development of multilingual, accurate, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.

Abstract: This article presents two corpora of English and Czech texts generated with large language models (LLMs). The motivation is to create a resource for comparing human-written texts with LLM-generated text linguistically. Emphasis was placed on ensuring these resources are multi-genre and rich in terms of topics, authors, and text types, while maintaining comparability with existing human-created corpora. These generated corpora replicate reference human corpora: BE21 by Paul Baker, which is a modern version of the original Brown Corpus, and Koditex corpus that also follows the Brown Corpus tradition but in Czech. The new corpora were generated using models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Alphabet, Meta, and DeepSeek, ranging from GPT-3 (davinci-002) to GPT-4.5, and are tagged according to the Universal Dependencies standard (i.e., they are tokenized, lemmatized, and morphologically and syntactically annotated). The subcorpus size varies according to the model used (the English part contains on average 864k tokens per model, 27M tokens altogether, the Czech partcontains on average 768k tokens per model, 21.5M tokens altogether). The corpora are freely available for download under the CC BY 4.0 license (the annotated data are under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence) and are also accessible through the search interface of the Czech National Corpus.

<div> memory-augmented agent, long-context question answering, reinforcement learning, selective retrieval, non-linear reasoning <br />
Summary: <br />
The article proposes a new memory-augmented agent called ReMemR1 to address challenges faced by large language models in long-context question answering tasks. ReMemR1 features callback-enhanced memory, allowing selective retrieval from a memory history for non-linear reasoning and revisiting early evidence. To improve training, the authors introduce Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Level Rewards (RLMLR), which combines final-answer rewards with dense, step-level signals for effective memory utilization. By addressing issues of irreversible forward processing, information loss, and sparse reinforcement signals, ReMemR1 shows significant enhancements in long-document QA tasks compared to existing memory-based approaches. Overall, the combination of callback-enhanced memory and multi-level rewards in RLMLR offers improved information retention, supervision, and support for multi-hop memory utilization in long-context reasoning agents. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Large language models face challenges in long-context question answering, where key evidence of a query may be dispersed across millions of tokens. Existing works equip large language models with a memory corpus that is dynamically updated during a single-pass document scan, also known as the "memorize while reading" methods. While this approach scales efficiently, it suffers from irreversible forward-only processing, information loss through overwriting, and sparse reinforcement learning signals. To tackle these challenges, we present ReMemR1, a memory-augmented agent with callback-enhanced memory that allows selective retrieval from the entire memory history and allows non-linear reasoning and revisiting of early evidence. To further strengthen training, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Level Rewards (RLMLR), which combines final-answer rewards with dense, step-level signals that guide effective memory use. Together, these contributions mitigate information degradation, improve supervision, and support multi-hop memory utilizing. Experiments on long-document QA show significant gains over existing memory-based approaches, which validates ReMemR1 as an effective solution for long-context reasoning agents.

<div> sycophancy, large language models, multi-agent debating systems, disagreement, innovation <br />
<br />Summary:
Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophancy, hindering multi-agent debating systems (MADS) that require productive disagreement. This study introduces a framework to define sycophancy in MADS, creates metrics to assess agent sycophancy, and explores its impact on information exchange. Results show that sycophancy leads to premature consensus, reducing debate accuracy compared to single-agent setups. The study identifies debater-driven and judge-driven sycophancy as key factors in debate failure. It proposes design principles to balance disagreement and cooperation in agent interactions within MADS. <div>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often display sycophancy, a tendency toward excessive agreeability. This behavior poses significant challenges for multi-agent debating systems (MADS) that rely on productive disagreement to refine arguments and foster innovative thinking. LLMs' inherent sycophancy can collapse debates into premature consensus, potentially undermining the benefits of multi-agent debate. While prior studies focus on user--LLM sycophancy, the impact of inter-agent sycophancy in debate remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce the first operational framework that (1) proposes a formal definition of sycophancy specific to MADS settings, (2) develops new metrics to evaluate the agent sycophancy level and its impact on information exchange in MADS, and (3) systematically investigates how varying levels of sycophancy across agent roles (debaters and judges) affects outcomes in both decentralized and centralized debate frameworks. Our findings reveal that sycophancy is a core failure mode that amplifies disagreement collapse before reaching a correct conclusion in multi-agent debates, yields lower accuracy than single-agent baselines, and arises from distinct debater-driven and judge-driven failure modes. Building on these findings, we propose actionable design principles for MADS, effectively balancing productive disagreement with cooperation in agent interactions.

Summary:
Our proposed approach addresses the rising cost of acquiring supervised data by focusing on self-improvement for large language models (LLMs). We introduce semantic voting as a mechanism for unverifiable tasks, moving from hard matching to soft matching based on semantic similarity. By leveraging a lightweight sentence embedding model, we achieve computational efficiency and improved performance compared to self-evaluation methods. This approach aims to mitigate overconfidence issues and reduce computational overhead associated with traditional self-evaluation techniques. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across diverse model architectures and tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising cost of acquiring supervised data has driven significant interest in self-improvement for large language models (LLMs). Straightforward unsupervised signals like majority voting have proven effective in generating pseudo-labels for verifiable tasks, while their applicability to unverifiable tasks (e.g., translation) is limited by the open-ended character of responses. As a result, self-evaluation mechanisms (e.g., self-judging and entropy minimization) are predominantly used to derive pseudo-labels. However, self-evaluation relying on LLMs typically incurs high computational overhead and introduces overconfidence issues due to intrinsic biases. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-evaluation-free approach for unverifiable tasks, designed for lightweight yet effective self-improvement. Inspired by majority voting commonly employed in verifiable tasks, we propose semantic voting as a novel mechanism that relaxes the principle of hard matching (i.e., exact matching) toward soft matching (i.e., semantic similarity). Soft matching is achieved by leveraging a lightweight sentence embedding model to quantify semantic similarity, thereby mitigating excessive computational burden and intrinsic bias-associated limitations of self-evaluation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial gains in computational efficiency and overall better performance than self-evaluation methods across diverse model architectures and tasks.

Summary: 
EviPath is introduced as a paradigm for developing retrieval-augmented generation agents by addressing the lack of process-level supervision in guiding tasks like task decomposition and decision-making. It consists of Abductive Subtask Planning to break down the problem into sub-questions and plan an optimal solution path, Faithful Sub-question Answering utilizing supporting evidence to generate answers, and Conversational Fine-Tuning for formatting the interaction trajectory for Supervised Fine-Tuning. EviPath enables large language models to learn reasoning and tool-use abilities from synthesized data. Experimental results on question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that training a model with EviPath-synthesized data leads to significant performance improvements, with a 14.7% increase in open-domain question answering accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation agents development is hindered by the lack of process-level supervision to effectively guide agentic capabilities like task decomposition, retriever invocation, and stepwise decision-making. While reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, it suffers from sparse rewards and the limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Meanwhile, existing data synthesis methods only produce chain-of-thought rationales and fail to model environmental interactions. In this paper, we propose EviPath, an evidence-anchored reasoning path synthesis paradigm for RAG agent development. EviPath comprises: (i) Abductive Subtask Planning, which decomposes the problem into sub-questions and iteratively plans an optimal solution path based on the dependencies between them; (ii) Faithful Sub-question Answering, which uses supporting evidence to construct a proxy environment to generate reasoning thoughts and answers for each sub-question; and (iii) Conversational Fine-Tuning, which formats the complete agent-environment interaction trajectory into a dialogue format suitable for Supervised Fine-Tuning. EviPath allows LLMs to learn complex reasoning and tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data. Extensive experiments on widely-used question-answering benchmarks show that an 8B parameter model trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a double-digit absolute EM gain of 14.7% in open-domain question answering.

Summary:
The article introduces a geometric framework using credal sets to analyze uncertainty in neural text generation for creative tasks. By evaluating language models on 500 writing prompts with human continuations, the study highlights gaps in capturing human creative variation. Total uncertainty is decomposed into epistemic and aleatoric components, with decoding strategy contributing significantly to epistemic uncertainty. Model scale does not strongly correlate with calibration quality, and there is no significant difference between base and instruction-tuned models. The findings provide insights for enhancing generation systems to align with human creativity. The experimental framework used in the study is also made available for further research.

Abstract: Understanding uncertainty in large language models remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in creative tasks where multiple valid outputs exist. We present a geometric framework using credal sets - convex hulls of probability distributions - to quantify and decompose uncertainty in neural text generation, calibrated against human creative variation. Analyzing 500 creative writing prompts from the WritingPrompts dataset with 10 unique human continuations each, we evaluate four language models across five decoding strategies, generating 100,000 stories. Our credal set analysis reveals substantial gaps in capturing human creative variation, with the best model-human calibration reaching only 0.434 (Gemma-2B with temperature 0.7). We decompose total uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components, finding that the choice of decoding strategy contributes 39.4% to 72.0% of total epistemic uncertainty. Model scale shows weak correlation with calibration quality and no significant difference exists between base and instruction-tuned models in calibration quality. Our geometric framework provides actionable insights for improving generation systems for human-AI creative alignment. We release our complete experimental framework.

<div> Efficiency, Large Language Models, Dual Adaptive Cache, Inference speedups, Generation quality
<br />
Summary:<br />
Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have shown strong performance but lack in inference efficiency due to their reliance on bidirectional attention. To address this issue, the Dual Adaptive Cache (d^2Cache) framework is introduced as a training-free approximate key-value cache for accelerating dLLM inference. d^2Cache employs a fine-grained selection strategy to update token states adaptively and cache the states of other tokens for reuse. This approach leads to significant inference speedups and improved generation quality in dLLMs such as LLaDA and Dream. Additionally, d^2Cache enables quasi left-to-right generation and helps mitigate premature overconfidence in tokens at the end of the sequence. The code for d^2Cache is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs), despite their promising performance, still suffer from inferior inference efficiency. This is because dLLMs rely on bidirectional attention and cannot directly benefit from the standard key-value (KV) cache as autoregressive models (ARMs) do. To tackle this issue, we introduce \textit{Dual aDaptive Cache} (d$^2$Cache), which is a training-free approximate KV cache framework for accelerating dLLM inference. d$^2$Cache features a two-stage fine-grained selection strategy to identify tokens and adaptively update their KV states at each decoding step, while caching the KV states of the remaining tokens for reuse. Furthermore, d$^2$Cache naturally offers a more reliable decoding alternative, which can enable quasi left-to-right generation and mitigate premature overconfidence in tokens at the end of the sequence. Extensive experimental results on two representative dLLMs (\ie, LLaDA and Dream) demonstrate that d$^2$Cache not only achieves substantial inference speedups, but also yields consistent improvements in generation quality. The code is available at https://github.com/Kamichanw/d2Cache.

The research article investigates the challenges faced by large language models (LLMs) in generating valid molecules using representations like SMILES in few-shot settings. The study explores the use of SELFIES, a representation where every string corresponds to a valid molecule, but finds that LLMs perform worse with SELFIES compared to SMILES. Furthermore, the article examines the limitations of LLMs in correcting invalid SMILES. To address these issues, the authors introduce SmiSelf, a cross-chemical language framework for invalid SMILES correction. SmiSelf converts invalid SMILES to SELFIES using grammatical rules and leverages SELFIES' mechanisms to ensure 100% validity while preserving molecular properties and enhancing overall performance. The experiments demonstrate the efficacy of SmiSelf in expanding the practical applications of LLMs in biomedicine and its compatibility with all SMILES-based generative models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Molecule generation is key to drug discovery and materials science, enabling the design of novel compounds with specific properties. Large language models (LLMs) can learn to perform a wide range of tasks from just a few examples. However, generating valid molecules using representations like SMILES is challenging for LLMs in few-shot settings. In this work, we explore how LLMs can generate 100% valid molecules. We evaluate whether LLMs can use SELFIES, a representation where every string corresponds to a valid molecule, for valid molecule generation but find that LLMs perform worse with SELFIES than with SMILES. We then examine LLMs' ability to correct invalid SMILES and find their capacity limited. Finally, we introduce SmiSelf, a cross-chemical language framework for invalid SMILES correction. SmiSelf converts invalid SMILES to SELFIES using grammatical rules, leveraging SELFIES' mechanisms to correct the invalid SMILES. Experiments show that SmiSelf ensures 100% validity while preserving molecular characteristics and maintaining or even enhancing performance on other metrics. SmiSelf helps expand LLMs' practical applications in biomedicine and is compatible with all SMILES-based generative models. Code is available at https://github.com/wentao228/SmiSelf.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a non-collaborative user simulation method for tool agents, aiming to improve their performance in real-world scenarios where users may not always be cooperative. The proposed user simulator architecture can simulate various non-collaborative behaviors such as requesting unavailable services, digressing into tangential conversations, expressing impatience, and providing incomplete utterances. Experiments conducted on MultiWOZ and $\tau$-bench datasets demonstrate a significant degradation in the performance of state-of-the-art tool agents when faced with non-collaborative users. The study highlights weaknesses in the agents' responses, including escalated hallucinations and dialogue breakdowns. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis to help the research community develop more robust tool agents and diagnose their performance under challenging real-world conditions. The user simulation framework introduced is easily extensible, offering valuable insights for future research in this field.

Abstract: Tool agents interact with users through multi-turn dialogues to accomplish various tasks. Recent studies have adopted user simulation methods to develop these agents in multi-turn settings. However, existing user simulators tend to be agent-friendly, exhibiting only cooperative behaviors, which fails to train and test agents against non-collaborative users in the real world. To address this, we propose a novel user simulator architecture that simulates four categories of non-collaborative behaviors: requesting unavailable services, digressing into tangential conversations, expressing impatience, and providing incomplete utterances. Our user simulator can simulate challenging and natural non-collaborative behaviors while reliably delivering all intents and information necessary to accomplish the task. Our experiments on MultiWOZ and $\tau$-bench reveal significant performance degradation in state-of-the-art tool agents when encountering non-collaborative users. We provide detailed analyses of agents' weaknesses under each non-collaborative condition, such as escalated hallucinations and dialogue breakdowns. Ultimately, we contribute an easily extensible user simulation framework to help the research community develop tool agents and preemptively diagnose them under challenging real-world conditions within their own services.

Abstract: Recent advancements have endowed Large Language Models (LLMs) with impressive general reasoning capabilities, yet they often struggle with personalization reasoning - the crucial ability to analyze user history, infer unique preferences, and generate tailored responses. To address this limitation, we introduce TagPR, a novel training framework that significantly enhances an LLM's intrinsic capacity for personalization reasoning through a tagging the thought approach. Our method first develops a data-driven pipeline to automatically generate and semantically label reasoning chains, creating a structured dataset that fosters interpretable reasoning. We then propose a synergistic training strategy that begins with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on this tagged data to establish foundational reasoning patterns, followed by a multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL) process. This RL phase is guided by a unique composite reward signal, which integrates tag-based constraints and a novel Personalization Reward Model with User Embeddings (PRMU) to achieve fine-grained alignment with user-specific logic. Extensive experiments on the public LaMP benchmark and a self-constructed dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, delivering an average improvement of 32.65% over the base model across all tasks. Our work validates that structured, interpretable reasoning is a highly effective pathway to unlocking genuine personalization capabilities in LLMs.

<div> Keywords: Tree search, Masked Diffusion Language Models, TReASURe, branching strategy, pruning rule

Summary:
TReASURe is a novel tree-search method designed to address challenges in aligning generative models with task-specific rewards. It introduces the UnmaskBranch strategy to diversify both token content and reveal order, and the ResubstituteScore pruning rule to score partially masked sequences with low-variance proxy completions. The method improves branching efficiency in terms of NFEs, approximates true rewards with bounded error, and shows enhancements with larger tree widths. Empirically, TReASURe achieves state-of-the-art results on various metrics such as perplexity, linguistic acceptability, sentiment control, and toxicity control. It outperforms prior methods within comparable compute budgets, especially showing significant gains in low-NFE scenarios. TReASURe demonstrates superior performance in aligning generative models with task-specific rewards in various natural language processing tasks.

Abstract: Tree search has recently emerged as a powerful framework for aligning generative models with task-specific rewards at test time. Applying tree search to Masked Diffusion Language Models, however, introduces two key challenges: (i) parallel unmasking yields highly correlated branches, limiting exploration, and (ii) reward evaluation via sampled completions produces high-variance estimates, making pruning unstable. We propose TReASURe, a tree-search test-time alignment method that addresses these issues. It introduces (i) UnmaskBranch, a branching strategy based on first-hitting unmasking that diversifies both token content and reveal order with a single model call per parent node, and (ii) ResubstituteScore, a pruning rule that uses deterministic resubstitution to score partially masked sequences with low-variance proxy completions. Theoretically, we quantify branching efficiency gains in NFEs (number of function evaluations), show that the scoring rule approximates the true reward with error bounded by predictive uncertainty, and prove improvements with larger tree widths. Empirically, TReASURe achieves state-of-the-art results on perplexity, linguistic acceptability, and control of sentiment and toxicity, outperforming prior methods under matched compute budgets, with especially strong gains in low-NFE regimes.

<div> interaction, language models, test-time policy adaptation, multi-turn, user feedback

Summary:
The paper introduces a new paradigm called Test-Time Policy Adaptation for Multi-Turn Interactions (T2PAM) to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in extended interactions by utilizing user feedback as a reward signal. A lightweight algorithm, Optimum-Referenced One-Step Adaptation (ROSA), is proposed to operationalize T2PAM and guide model parameters towards a theoretical optimal policy in a single update step. Theoretical analysis ensures that ROSA converges to user preferences as interactions increase. Extensive experiments validate that ROSA significantly enhances task effectiveness and efficiency on challenging benchmarks. This approach enables LLMs to adapt to real-time user feedback, improving their ability to complete complex tasks during multi-turn interactions. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) employ multi-turn interaction as a fundamental paradigm for completing complex tasks. However, their performance often degrades in extended interactions, as they are typically trained on static, single-turn data, which hinders their ability to adapt to real-time user feedback. To address this limitation, we first propose a new paradigm: Test-Time Policy Adaptation for Multi-Turn Interactions (T2PAM), which utilizes user feedback from the ongoing interaction as a reward signal to estimate a latent optimal policy aligned with user preferences, then updates a small subset of parameters to steer the model toward this policy, ultimately enabling efficient in-conversation self-correction. We then introduce Optimum-Referenced One-Step Adaptation (ROSA), a lightweight algorithm that operationalizes T2PAM. ROSA guides the model parameters toward a theoretical optimal policy in a single, efficient update step, avoiding costly iterative gradient-based optimization and minimizing computational overhead. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis guaranteeing that the policy of ROSA converges to the preference of user as the number of interactions increases. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmark demonstrate that ROSA achieves significant improvements in both task effectiveness and efficiency.

<div> scaling, pretraining, language model, latent thoughts, token generation  
Summary:  
- The study introduces a new pre-training approach called Pretraining Language Models with Latent Thoughts to enhance token generation in language models.  
- This approach involves generating an intermediate latent thought before predicting the actual subsequent token, allowing the language model to refine its predictions in continuous space.  
- Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms standard models with double the parameters at the same inference cost.  
- The model, pretrained on a large dataset, demonstrates superior performance in both language modeling and various downstream tasks compared to existing models.  
- Increasing the number of latent thoughts generated before each token, similar to the Chain-of-Thought approach, consistently improves the model's performance.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The remarkable success of Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which enhances performance by scaling generation steps at test-time, inspires us to ask: can we leverage a similar scaling of computational steps during pretraining to improve the generation of each individual token? To address this, we propose a novel pre-training methodology: Pretraining Language Models with Latent Thoughts. Our approach pretrains a language model (LM) to first generate an intermediate latent thought-the last hidden state of the current position-which is then used as input to predict the actual subsequent token. This additional computational step enables the LM to refine its prediction within unconstrained continuous space. Our experiments demonstrate that, at an identical inference cost, a LM that generates one additional latent thought per token outperforms a standard model with double the parameters. For instance, ours-1.4B (Pythia Arch), pretrained on 300B tokens from the Pile, significantly surpasses the vanilla Pythia-2.8B trained on the same data on both language modeling and a range of general downstream tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of latent thoughts generated before each actual token-forming a chain analogous to CoT-consistently improves the model's performance.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Model, multi-agent systems, compliance, attention analysis, full-stack framework

Summary:<br /><br />
This article introduces a framework to address hierarchical compliance issues in Large Language Model-powered multi-agent systems. The framework consists of three stages. First, the Contextualized Role Adherence Score (CRAS) metric is used to measure role adherence in four dimensions. Second, attention drift analysis identifies that instruction conflicts are often resolved in middle layers. Lastly, the Surgical Alignment of Instruction Layers (SAIL) approach focuses on optimizing token-weighted preference objectives in the localized focal layers to improve instruction hierarchy compliance without full-model finetuning. Through experiments on standard benchmarks and MAS frameworks, the surgical approach shows significant improvements in instruction hierarchy compliance, such as a 5.60% increase with AutoGen on MedQA. <div>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have rapidly advanced collaborative reasoning, tool use, and role-specialized coordination in complex tasks. However, reliability-critical deployment remains hindered by a systemic failure mode: hierarchical compliance under instruction conflicts (system-user, peer-peer), where agents misprioritize system-level rules in the presence of competing demands. Moreover, widely used macro-level metrics (e.g., pass@k) obscure these micro-level violations and offer little actionable guidance for remedy. In this work, we present a full-stack, three-stage framework: (1) Diagnose - Contextualized Role Adherence Score (CRAS), a query-wise, context-aware scoring metric that decomposes role adherence into four measurable dimensions; (2) Localize - attention drift analysis revealing that instruction conflicts are resolved by attention heads that are largely concentrated in middle layers; (3) Align - Surgical Alignment of Instruction Layers (SAIL), which installs LoRA only on the localized focal layers and optimizes a token-weighted DPO-style preference objective that credits tokens by their focal attentional contribution. Across standard benchmarks and MAS frameworks, our surgical approach improves instruction hierarchy compliance (e.g., +5.60% with AutoGen on MedQA) without full-model finetuning.

Summary: 
- The study aimed to investigate the timing of syntax in sentence processing using EEG and eye-tracking data from the ZuCo corpus.
- The research aimed to disentangle syntactic category detection and phrase structure construction processes and determine their temporal order during naturalistic reading.
- Analysis of gaze transitions suggested that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads, indicating that phrase structures organize scanpaths rather than serial word order.
- Bayesian network modeling revealed that structural depth was the primary driver of deviations from linear reading, outweighing lexical familiarity and surprisal.
- Fixation-related potentials showed that syntactic surprisal influences neural activity both before word onset and during early integration, supporting a predictive "tree-scaffolding" account of comprehension.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central question in psycholinguistics is the timing of syntax in sentence processing. Much of the existing evidence comes from violation paradigms, which conflate two separable processes - syntactic category detection and phrase structure construction - and implicitly assume that phrase structure follows category detection. In this study, we use co-registered EEG and eye-tracking data from the ZuCo corpus to disentangle these processes and test their temporal order under naturalistic reading conditions. Analyses of gaze transitions showed that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads, suggesting that phrase structures, rather than serial word order, organize scanpaths. Bayesian network modeling further revealed that structural depth was the strongest driver of deviations from linear reading, outweighing lexical familiarity and surprisal. Finally, fixation-related potentials demonstrated that syntactic surprisal influences neural activity before word onset (-184 to -10 ms) and during early integration (48 to 300 ms). These findings extend current models of syntactic timing by showing that phrase structure construction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences, supporting a predictive "tree-scaffolding" account of comprehension.

<div> Keywords: Recent reasoning LLMs, few-shot CoT, semantic misguidance, strategy transfer failure, Insight-to-Solve

Summary: 
Recent research has shown that reasoning language models (RLMs), particularly those trained with verifier-based reinforcement learning, struggle with few-shot commonsense reasoning tasks compared to direct question answering. A study using high-quality reasoning traces identified two key reasons for this performance decline: semantic misguidance, where models mistakenly treat target questions as identical to exemplars, and strategy transfer failure, where models struggle to apply reasoning strategies from demonstrations to new questions. To address these issues, the Insight-to-Solve (I2S) method was introduced, which converts demonstrations into reusable insights for improved reasoning trace extraction. Experimental results across various benchmarks demonstrated that I2S and its refined version, I2S+, outperformed both direct answering and scaling baselines for RLMs. Even GPT models showed performance improvement with I2S, highlighting the effectiveness of leveraging in-context demonstrations for enhanced reasoning capabilities.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent reasoning LLMs (RLMs), especially those trained with verifier-based reinforcement learning, often perform worse with few-shot CoT than with direct answering. We revisit this paradox using high-quality reasoning traces from DeepSeek-R1 as demonstrations and find that adding more exemplars consistently degrades accuracy, even when demonstrations are optimal. A detailed analysis reveals two mechanisms behind this decline: (i) semantic misguidance, where high textual similarity leads the model to treat the target as the same as the exemplar and to copy intermediate steps verbatim; and (ii) strategy transfer failure, where the model struggles to extract useful reasoning strategies and apply them to target questions. Guided by these, we introduce Insight-to-Solve (I2S), a sequential test-time procedure that turns demonstrations into explicit, reusable insights and derives a target-specific reasoning trace; optionally, the reasoning is self-refined for coherence and correctness (I2S+). Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that I2S and I2S+ consistently outperform both direct answering and test-time scaling baselines across open- and closed-source models. Even for GPT models, our method helps: on AIME'25, GPT-4.1 rises by +14.0%, and o1-mini improves by +2.7% on AIME and +1.7% on GPQA, indicating that in-context demonstrations can be harnessed effectively via insight-refine-solve framework.

<div> K-pop, code-switching, English lyrics, global charts, linguistic strategies<br />
<br />
Summary:
K-pop songs that achieve global chart success, particularly on the Billboard Hot 100 and Global 200 charts, heavily feature code-switching and English lyrics, reflecting market strategies. Both male and female performers in K-pop use high levels of English and code-switching, with female solo artists leaning more towards English. Statistical analysis showed no significant gender-based differences in language usage. A classification task successfully predicted performer gender from lyrics. Songs charting on the Hot 100 versus the Global 200 showed differences, indicating that higher English usage may be more critical for success on the US-focused Hot 100. The linguistic choices in K-pop lyrics are influenced by global market pressures, reflecting performer identity and chart context. <div>
arXiv:2509.23197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code switching, particularly between Korean and English, has become a defining feature of modern K-pop, reflecting both aesthetic choices and global market strategies. This paper is a primary investigation into the linguistic strategies employed in K-pop songs that achieve global chart success, with a focus on the role of code-switching and English lyric usage. A dataset of K-pop songs that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 and Global 200 charts from 2017 to 2025, spanning 14 groups and 8 solo artists, was compiled. Using this dataset, the proportion of English and Korean lyrics, the frequency of code-switching, and other stylistic features were analysed. It was found that English dominates the linguistic landscape of globally charting K-pop songs, with both male and female performers exhibiting high degrees of code-switching and English usage. Statistical tests indicated no significant gender-based differences, although female solo artists tend to favour English more consistently. A classification task was also performed to predict performer gender from lyrics, achieving macro F1 scores up to 0.76 using multilingual embeddings and handcrafted features. Finally, differences between songs charting on the Hot 100 versus the Global 200 were examined, suggesting that, while there is no significant gender difference in English, higher English usage may be more critical for success in the US-focused Hot 100. The findings highlight how linguistic choices in K-pop lyrics are shaped by global market pressures and reveal stylistic patterns that reflect performer identity and chart context.

Summary: 
Language models face the challenge of deciding between instrumental adjuncts and attributive modifiers when generating prepositional phrases. This study focuses on investigating Gemma-2 to understand how the decision is made. A prompt suite with prepositional phrases is used to reveal a preference for instrumental readings over attributive ones. By analyzing individual attention heads, it is possible to shift the distribution of functional roles, reducing instruments and increasing attributes. The research sheds light on the internal mechanisms involved in resolving the split decision between instrumental and attributive complements in prepositional phrases. <div>
arXiv:2509.23204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language Models, when generating prepositional phrases, must often decide for whether their complements functions as an instrumental adjunct (describing the verb adverbially) or an attributive modifier (enriching the noun adjectivally), yet the internal mechanisms that resolve this split decision remain poorly understood. In this study, we conduct a targeted investigation into Gemma-2 to uncover and control the generation of prepositional complements. We assemble a prompt suite containing with-headed prepositional phrases whose contexts equally accommodate either an instrumental or attributive continuation, revealing a strong preference for an instrumental reading at a ratio of 3:4. To pinpoint individual attention heads that favor instrumental over attributive complements, we project activations into the vocabulary space. By scaling the value vector of a single attention head, we can shift the distribution of functional roles of complements, attenuating instruments to 33% while elevating attributes to 36%.

Summary:
The article introduces PARL-MT, a framework for training large language models (LLMs) in multi-turn function calling tasks. By incorporating progress awareness, PARL-MT aims to allow LLMs to summarize past interactions and plan future actions for coherent and long-horizon task execution in real-world applications. The framework consists of a Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline for constructing datasets combining conversation summaries with future task planning, and a Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm that integrates progress awareness into training. Empirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT significantly outperforms existing methods, showcasing the effectiveness of progress awareness in enhancing the efficiency and robustness of multi-turn function calling tasks. <div>
arXiv:2509.23206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive success in single-turn function calling, yet real-world applications such as travel planning or multi-stage data analysis typically unfold across multi-turn conversations. In these settings, LLMs must not only issue accurate function calls at each step but also maintain progress awareness, the ability to summarize past interactions and plan future actions to ensure coherent, long-horizon task execution. Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to isolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks explicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness into LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs datasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy and improve alignment between local actions and global task completion. Empirical results on two public benchmarks demonstrate that PARL-MT significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of progress awareness in enabling robust and efficient multi-turn function calling.

Abstract: This study aims to test and evaluate the capabilities and characteristics of current mainstream Visual Language Models (VLMs) in generating critiques for traditional Chinese painting. To achieve this, we first developed a quantitative framework for Chinese painting critique. This framework was constructed by extracting multi-dimensional evaluative features covering evaluative stance, feature focus, and commentary quality from human expert critiques using a zero-shot classification model. Based on these features, several representative critic personas were defined and quantified. This framework was then employed to evaluate selected VLMs such as Llama, Qwen, or Gemini. The experimental design involved persona-guided prompting to assess the VLM's ability to generate critiques from diverse perspectives. Our findings reveal the current performance levels, strengths, and areas for improvement of VLMs in the domain of art critique, offering insights into their potential and limitations in complex semantic understanding and content generation tasks.

Summary:
A new study focuses on the accuracy of Wikipedia and introduces a system called CLAIRE for detecting inconsistencies in the corpus. Through a user study with Wikipedia editors, it was found that CLAIRE increased confidence and identified more inconsistencies compared to manual detection. The study also introduces WIKICOLLIDE, the first benchmark of real Wikipedia inconsistencies. Analysis using CLAIRE-assisted sampling revealed that at least 3.3% of English Wikipedia facts contradict each other. Inconsistencies were found to propagate into other datasets as well. Benchmarking on this dataset showed room for improvement, with the best automated system achieving an AUROC of only 75.1%. The results suggest that contradictions are a measurable aspect of Wikipedia, and LLM-based systems like CLAIRE can assist editors in improving knowledge consistency on a large scale.

Abstract: Wikipedia is the largest open knowledge corpus, widely used worldwide and serving as a key resource for training large language models (LLMs) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. Ensuring its accuracy is therefore critical. But how accurate is Wikipedia, and how can we improve it?
  We focus on inconsistencies, a specific type of factual inaccuracy, and introduce the task of corpus-level inconsistency detection. We present CLAIRE, an agentic system that combines LLM reasoning with retrieval to surface potentially inconsistent claims along with contextual evidence for human review. In a user study with experienced Wikipedia editors, 87.5% reported higher confidence when using CLAIRE, and participants identified 64.7% more inconsistencies in the same amount of time.
  Combining CLAIRE with human annotation, we contribute WIKICOLLIDE, the first benchmark of real Wikipedia inconsistencies. Using random sampling with CLAIRE-assisted analysis, we find that at least 3.3% of English Wikipedia facts contradict another fact, with inconsistencies propagating into 7.3% of FEVEROUS and 4.0% of AmbigQA examples. Benchmarking strong baselines on this dataset reveals substantial headroom: the best fully automated system achieves an AUROC of only 75.1%.
  Our results show that contradictions are a measurable component of Wikipedia and that LLM-based systems like CLAIRE can provide a practical tool to help editors improve knowledge consistency at scale.

Fin-ExBERT is introduced as a framework for extracting user intent-relevant sentences from financial dialogue transcripts. It utilizes a domain-adapted BERT backbone with LoRA adapters, enabling efficient fine-tuning with limited labeled data. The training strategy involves a two-stage approach with progressive unfreezing, starting with training the classifier head and gradually fine-tuning the entire model. A dynamic thresholding strategy based on probability curvature is employed to ensure robust extraction under uncertainty.

Abstract: Financial dialogue transcripts pose a unique challenge for sentence-level information extraction due to their informal structure, domain-specific vocabulary, and variable intent density. We introduce Fin-ExBERT, a lightweight and modular framework for extracting user intent-relevant sentences from annotated financial service calls. Our approach builds on a domain-adapted BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) backbone enhanced with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapters, enabling efficient fine-tuning using limited labeled data. We propose a two-stage training strategy with progressive unfreezing: initially training a classifier head while freezing the backbone, followed by gradual fine-tuning of the entire model with differential learning rates. To ensure robust extraction under uncertainty, we adopt a dynamic thresholding strategy based on probability curvature (elbow detection), avoiding fixed cutoff heuristics. Empirical results show strong precision and F1 performance on real-world transcripts, with interpretable output suitable for downstream auditing and question-answering workflows. The full framework supports batched evaluation, visualization, and calibrated export, offering a deployable solution for financial dialogue mining.

<div> keyword: dLLMs, A2D, token-level alignment, safety benchmarks, prefilling attacks
Summary: 
A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense) is a token-level alignment method designed to enhance the safety and robustness of diffusion large language models (dLLMs). By aligning dLLMs at the token level, A2D is able to detect and prevent the generation of harmful outputs, even in situations where harmful content may appear at any position. This alignment strategy enables real-time monitoring, allowing dLLMs to automatically terminate responses if unsafe content emerges. Additionally, A2D significantly reduces the success rates of template-based prefilling attacks like DIJA, making it much more difficult for malicious content to bypass safety measures. On safety benchmarks, A2D consistently outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in preventing harmful content generation. The use of thresholded [EOS] probabilities also allows for faster and more efficient safe termination of responses, enhancing overall security and safety in language model generation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.23286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) enable any-order generation, but this flexibility enlarges the attack surface: harmful spans may appear at arbitrary positions, and template-based prefilling attacks such as DIJA bypass response-level refusals. We introduce A2D (Any-Order, Any-Step Defense), a token-level alignment method that aligns dLLMs to emit an [EOS] refusal signal whenever harmful content arises. By aligning safety directly at the token-level under randomized masking, A2D achieves robustness to both any-decoding-order and any-step prefilling attacks under various conditions. It also enables real-time monitoring: dLLMs may begin a response but automatically terminate if unsafe continuation emerges. On safety benchmarks, A2D consistently prevents the generation of harmful outputs, slashing DIJA success rates from over 80% to near-zero (1.3% on LLaDA-8B-Instruct, 0.0% on Dream-v0-Instruct-7B), and thresholded [EOS] probabilities allow early rejection, yielding up to 19.3x faster safe termination.

<div> Policy compliance assessment, Policy Reasoning Traces, LLM, HIPAA, GDPR

Summary:
Policy compliance assessment is crucial for evaluating adherence to human-defined rules, known as policies. Traditional methods rely on expert reasoning processes, but acquiring such documentation is costly. This paper introduces Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT), specialized reasoning chains that enhance LLM's policy assessment capabilities. Empirical evaluations show that using PRTs improves performance for open-weight and commercial models, setting new state-of-the-art for HIPAA and GDPR policies. PRTs also improve an LLM's ability to cite policy clauses accurately and influence compliance decisions through their utilization from raw chains of thought. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of PRTs in enhancing policy compliance assessment and highlights their potential to improve performance and decision-making in various policy settings.

Abstract: Policy compliance assessment is a fundamental task of evaluating whether an input case strictly complies with a set of human-defined rules, more generally known as policies. In practice, human experts follow a systematic, step-by-step process to identify violations with respect to specific stipulations outlined in the policy. However, such documentation of gold-standard, expert-level reasoning processes is costly to acquire. In this paper, we introduce Policy Reasoning Traces (PRT), a form of specialized generated reasoning chains that serve as a reasoning bridge to improve an LLM's policy compliance assessment capabilities. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the use of PRTs for both inference-time and training-time scenarios significantly enhances the performance of open-weight and commercial models, setting a new state-of-the-art for HIPAA and GDPR policies. Beyond accuracy gains, we also highlight how PRTs can improve an LLM's ability to accurately cite policy clauses, as well as influence compliance decisions through their high utilization from the raw chains of thought.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) via environmental exploration. As the intrinsic properties of the environment determine the abilities that LLMs can learn, the environment plays a important role in the RL finetuning process. An ideal LLM reasoning environment should possess three core characteristics: scalability, generalizable reasoning, and verifiability. However, existing mathematical and coding environments are difficult to scale due to heavy reliance on expert annotation, while the skills learned in game-based environments are too specialized to generalize. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{E}nvironment (SIE) framework. SIE achieves scalability by automatically constructing reasoning environments from large-scale structured data, where the rich compositional patterns naturally support generalizable reasoning. Moreover, the explicit schemas and reasoning chains in structured data provide a foundation for rule-based verifiability. Experimental results show that SIE framework not only achieves substantial improvements in in-domain structured reasoning, but also enables the learned compositional reasoning skills to generalize effectively to out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. We further explored learning in information-limited partial SIEs and found that LLMs can infer the missing information through exploring the environment, leading to robust reasoning improvements and generalization performance.

<title>C-Evolve: Consensus-based Evolution for Prompt Groups</title>

Abstract: Prompt evolution algorithms offer a powerful paradigm for enhancing AI systems based on closed-source models, while few work explores whether aggregating results from multiple prompts to reach a consensus can further advance the system capability boundary. In this paper, we introduce Consensus-Evolve (C-Evolve), an evolutionary algorithm that discovers a group of prompts whose aggregated outputs after majority voting achieve optimal performance. More specifically, C-Evolve employs an island-based evolutionary algorithm to maintain population diversity, and prompts from distinct islands are selected to form groups to aggregate their outputs. The key difference from single individual evolution is a voting score, which evaluates each individual prompt's contribution within groups. We take this as the fitness score for evolution instead of individual performance. Consequently, C-Evolve is more likely to produce and maintain prompts with higher potential to form a high-performing group and eliminate low-performing ones, gradually improving the group performance after reaching consensus. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks, including both open-ended tasks like HotpotQA and closed-ended tasks like MATH. On Qwen3-8B, C-Evolve achieves 70.67% on HotpotQA and 43.88% on IFBench, which are 4.95% and 2.73% higher than GEPA, respectively. For GPT-4.1-mini, the accuracy on IFBench is further improved to 47.96% and reaches 95.33% in the MATH benchmark. These results demonstrate the C-Evolve's competitive performance.

<title>Dual-Space Smoothness for Robust and Balanced LLM Unlearning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23362</link>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models, Machine Unlearning has emerged to address growing concerns around user privacy, copyright infringement, and overall safety. Yet state-of-the-art (SOTA) unlearning methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and metric imbalance, for example by over-optimizing one objective (e.g., unlearning effectiveness, utility preservation, or privacy protection) at the expense of others. In addition, small perturbations in the representation or parameter space can be exploited by relearn and jailbreak attacks. To address these challenges, we propose PRISM, a unified framework that enforces dual-space smoothness in representation and parameter spaces to improve robustness and balance unlearning metrics. PRISM consists of two smoothness optimization stages: (i) a representation space stage that employs a robustly trained probe to defend against jailbreak attacks, and (ii) a parameter-space stage that decouples retain-forget gradient conflicts, reduces imbalance, and smooths the parameter space to mitigate relearning attacks. Extensive experiments on WMDP and MUSE, across conversational-dialogue and continuous-text settings, show that PRISM outperforms SOTA baselines under multiple attacks while achieving a better balance among key metrics.

<title>MedCritical: Enhancing Medical Reasoning in Small Language Models via Self-Collaborative Correction</title>

Abstract: In the field of medicine, complex reasoning tasks such as clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and medical knowledge integration pose significant challenges, where small language models often underperform compared to large language models like GPT-4 and Deepseek. Recent knowledge distillation-based methods aim to address these issues through teacher-guided error correction, but this LLM as judge approach remains challenging in terms of cost, time, and efficiency. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel two-stage framework, MedCritical, which uses a small language model fine-tuned by a large teacher model to play against itself. In the first stage, we extract high-level and detailed long-chain thought templates from the teacher model to guide the student model to generate more complex reasoning thoughts. In the second stage, we introduce direct preference optimization (DPO) through model self-iteration collaboration to enhance the reasoning ability of the student model by playing against the correction trajectory of the fine-tuned model during training. This model self-learning DPO approach teaches the student model to use its own error-driven insights to consolidate its skills and knowledge to solve complex problems, and achieves comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation methods using teacher models at a lower cost. Notably, our MedCritical 7B model outperforms the Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04\% and 10.12\% respectively on the CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among 7B-class small models.

<title>Alignment through Meta-Weighted Online Sampling: Bridging the Gap between Data Generation and Preference Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23371</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23371</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preference optimization is crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and intentions. A significant challenge in this process is the distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the evolving model policy. Existing methods attempt to reduce this gap using static heuristics or decoupled online sampling strategies, but they often fail to adapt to the model's dynamic learning state. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework that dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a lightweight meta-learner, as an "alignment gap estimator", to evaluate the potential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This guides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the optimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of online and offline data. Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench demonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference optimization approaches across various settings, while reducing 42% in online annotation costs.

<title>CCD: Mitigating Hallucinations in Radiology MLLMs via Clinical Contrastive Decoding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23379</link>

arXiv:2509.23379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.

<title>Guard Vector: Beyond English LLM Guardrails with Task-Vector Composition and Streaming-Aware Prefix SFT</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23381</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Guard Vector, a safety task vector computed as the parameter difference between a guardrail model (Guard Model) and a same-architecture pretrained language model. Composing this vector with a target language model yields a Target Guard Model (TGM). We then adapt TGM with a streaming-aware approach that combines prefix-based training and evaluation with a classifier that produces a single-token output. With this composition alone, TGM improves classification quality over established Guard Models across standard safety suites and enables language extensibility to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, requiring neither additional training nor target language labels. It also demonstrates model portability across two widely used public guardrail backbones, Llama and Gemma. With prefix SFT (supervised fine-tuning), TGM preserves classification quality under streaming by aligning the behavior between prefix inputs and full-text inputs. The single-token output design increases throughput and reduces latency. Together, these components reduce data and compute requirements while promoting streaming-aware evaluation practices, thereby contributing to a more responsible AI ecosystem.

<title>Train Once, Answer All: Many Pretraining Experiments for the Cost of One</title>

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that controlled pretraining experiments are a powerful tool for understanding learning, reasoning, and memorization in large language models (LLMs). However, the computational cost of pretraining presents a significant constraint. To overcome this constraint, we propose to conduct multiple pretraining experiments simultaneously during a single training run. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by conducting ten experiments during the training of a 1.5B parameter model on 210B tokens. Although we only train a single model, we can replicate the results from multiple previous works on data contamination, poisoning, and memorization. We also conduct novel investigations into knowledge acquisition, mathematical reasoning, and watermarking. For example, we dynamically update the training data until the model acquires a particular piece of knowledge. Remarkably, the influence of the ten experiments on the model's training dynamics and overall performance is minimal. However, interactions between different experiments may act as a potential confounder in our approach. We propose to test for interactions with continual pretraining experiments, finding them to be negligible in our setup. Overall, our findings suggest that performing multiple pretraining experiments in a single training run can enable rigorous scientific experimentation with large models on a compute budget.

<title>No Loss, No Gain: Gated Refinement and Adaptive Compression for Prompt Optimization</title>

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for leveraging the full potential of large language models (LLMs). While automatic prompt optimization offers a scalable alternative to costly manual design, generating effective prompts remains challenging. Existing methods often struggle to stably generate improved prompts, leading to low efficiency, and overlook that prompt optimization easily gets trapped in local optima. Addressing this, we propose GRACE, a framework that integrates two synergistic strategies: Gated Refinement and Adaptive Compression, achieving Efficient prompt optimization. The gated refinement strategy introduces a feedback regulation gate and an update rejection gate, which refine update signals to produce stable and effective prompt improvements. When optimization stagnates, the adaptive compression strategy distills the prompt's core concepts, restructuring the optimization trace and opening new paths. By strategically introducing information loss through refinement and compression, GRACE delivers substantial gains in performance and efficiency. In extensive experiments on 11 tasks across three practical domains, including BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), domain-specific, and general NLP tasks, GRACE achieves significant average relative performance improvements of 4.7%, 4.4% and 2.7% over state-of-the-art methods, respectively. Further analysis shows that GRACE achieves these gains using only 25% of the prompt generation budget required by prior methods, highlighting its high optimization efficiency and low computational overhead. Our code is available at https://github.com/Eric8932/GRACE.

<title>Liaozhai through the Looking-Glass: On Paratextual Explicitation of Culture-Bound Terms in Machine Translation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The faithful transfer of contextually-embedded meaning continues to challenge contemporary machine translation (MT), particularly in the rendering of culture-bound terms--expressions or concepts rooted in specific languages or cultures, resisting direct linguistic transfer. Existing computational approaches to explicitating these terms have focused exclusively on in-text solutions, overlooking paratextual apparatus in the footnotes and endnotes employed by professional translators. In this paper, we formalize Genette's (1987) theory of paratexts from literary and translation studies to introduce the task of paratextual explicitation for MT. We construct a dataset of 560 expert-aligned paratexts from four English translations of the classical Chinese short story collection Liaozhai and evaluate LLMs with and without reasoning traces on choice and content of explicitation. Experiments across intrinsic prompting and agentic retrieval methods establish the difficulty of this task, with human evaluation showing that LLM-generated paratexts improve audience comprehension, though remain considerably less effective than translator-authored ones. Beyond model performance, statistical analysis reveals that even professional translators vary widely in their use of paratexts, suggesting that cultural mediation is inherently open-ended rather than prescriptive. Our findings demonstrate the potential of paratextual explicitation in advancing MT beyond linguistic equivalence, with promising extensions to monolingual explanation and personalized adaptation.

Abstract: Advances in automated scoring are closely aligned with advances in machine-learning and natural-language-processing techniques. With recent progress in large language models (LLMs), the use of ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and other generative-AI chatbots for automated scoring has been explored. Given their strong reasoning capabilities, LLMs can also produce rationales to support the scores they assign. Thus, evaluating the rationales provided by both human and LLM raters can help improve the understanding of the reasoning that each type of rater applies when assigning a score. This study investigates the rationales of human and LLM raters to identify potential causes of scoring inconsistency. Using essays from a large-scale test, the scoring accuracy of GPT-4o, Gemini, and other LLMs is examined based on quadratic weighted kappa and normalized mutual information. Cosine similarity is used to evaluate the similarity of the rationales provided. In addition, clustering patterns in rationales are explored using principal component analysis based on the embeddings of the rationales. The findings of this study provide insights into the accuracy and ``thinking'' of LLMs in automated scoring, helping to improve the understanding of the rationales behind both human scoring and LLM-based automated scoring.

Abstract: Language models (LMs) encode substantial factual knowledge, but often produce answers judged as incorrect. We hypothesize that many of these answers are actually correct, but are expressed in alternative surface forms that are dismissed due to an overly strict evaluation, leading to an underestimation of models' parametric knowledge. We propose Retrieval-Constrained Decoding (RCD), a decoding strategy that restricts model outputs to unique surface forms. We introduce YAGO-QA, a dataset of 19,137 general knowledge questions. Evaluating open-source LMs from 135M to 70B parameters, we show that standard decoding undervalues their knowledge. For instance, Llama-3.1-70B scores only 32.3% F1 with vanilla decoding but 46.0% with RCD. Similarly, Llama-3.1-8B reaches 33.0% with RCD, outperforming the larger model under vanilla decoding. We publicly share the code and dataset at https://github.com/Rajjaa/disambiguated-LLM.

<title>Cognition-of-Thought Elicits Social-Aligned Reasoning in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but can still exhibit harmful behaviors. Current alignment strategies typically embed safety into model weights, making these controls implicit, static, and difficult to modify. This paper introduces Cognition-of-Thought (CooT), a novel decoding-time framework that equips LLMs with an explicit cognitive self-monitoring loop. CooT couples a standard text Generator with a cognitive Perceiver that continuously monitors the unfolding sequence. The Perceiver uses a structured, precedence-based hierarchy of principles (e.g., safety over obedience) to detect potential misalignments as they arise. When violations are flagged, CooT intervenes by rolling back the generation to the point of error and regenerating under injected guidance that combines universal social priors with context-specific warnings. CooT thus transforms alignment from a fixed property into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference, allowing for flexible policy updates without retraining the model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.

<title>Text-Based Approaches to Item Difficulty Modeling in Large-Scale Assessments: A Systematic Review</title>

Abstract: Item difficulty plays a crucial role in test performance, interpretability of scores, and equity for all test-takers, especially in large-scale assessments. Traditional approaches to item difficulty modeling rely on field testing and classical test theory (CTT)-based item analysis or item response theory (IRT) calibration, which can be time-consuming and costly. To overcome these challenges, text-based approaches leveraging machine learning and language models, have emerged as promising alternatives. This paper reviews and synthesizes 37 articles on automated item difficulty prediction in large-scale assessment settings published through May 2025. For each study, we delineate the dataset, difficulty parameter, subject domain, item type, number of items, training and test data split, input, features, model, evaluation criteria, and model performance outcomes. Results showed that although classic machine learning models remain relevant due to their interpretability, state-of-the-art language models, using both small and large transformer-based architectures, can capture syntactic and semantic patterns without the need for manual feature engineering. Uniquely, model performance outcomes were summarized to serve as a benchmark for future research and overall, text-based methods have the potential to predict item difficulty with root mean square error (RMSE) as low as 0.165, Pearson correlation as high as 0.87, and accuracy as high as 0.806. The review concludes by discussing implications for practice and outlining future research directions for automated item difficulty modeling.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate predictions based on prompts without additional fine-tuning. While prompt engineering has been widely studied, the impact of role design within prompts remains underexplored. This study examines the influence of role configurations in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o from OpenAI and Llama2-7b and Llama2-13b from Meta. We evaluate the models' performance across datasets, focusing on tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, question answering, and math reasoning. Our findings suggest the potential of role-based prompt structuring to enhance LLM performance.

Abstract: This paper describes AraS2P, our speech-to-phonemes system submitted to the Iqra'Eval 2025 Shared Task. We adapted Wav2Vec2-BERT via Two-Stage training strategy. In the first stage, task-adaptive continue pretraining was performed on large-scale Arabic speech-phonemes datasets, which were generated by converting the Arabic text using the MSA Phonetiser. In the second stage, the model was fine-tuned on the official shared task data, with additional augmentation from XTTS-v2-synthesized recitations featuring varied Ayat segments, speaker embeddings, and textual perturbations to simulate possible human errors. The system ranked first on the official leaderboard, demonstrating that phoneme-aware pretraining combined with targeted augmentation yields strong performance in phoneme-level mispronunciation detection.

<title>From Human Annotation to Automation: LLM-in-the-Loop Active Learning for Arabic Sentiment Analysis</title>

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP), particularly sentiment analysis, plays a vital role in areas like marketing, customer service, and social media monitoring by providing insights into user opinions and emotions. However, progress in Arabic sentiment analysis remains limited due to the lack of large, high-quality labeled datasets. While active learning has proven effective in reducing annotation efforts in other languages, few studies have explored it in Arabic sentiment tasks. Likewise, the use of large language models (LLMs) for assisting annotation and comparing their performance to human labeling is still largely unexplored in the Arabic context. In this paper, we propose an active learning framework for Arabic sentiment analysis designed to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance. We evaluate multiple deep learning architectures: Specifically, long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent units (GRU), and recurrent neural networks (RNN), across three benchmark datasets: Hunger Station, AJGT, and MASAC, encompassing both modern standard Arabic and dialectal variations. Additionally, two annotation strategies are compared: Human labeling and LLM-assisted labeling. Five LLMs are evaluated as annotators: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek Chat, and LLaMA 3 70B Instruct. For each dataset, the best-performing LLM was used: GPT-4o for Hunger Station, Claude 3 Sonnet for AJGT, and DeepSeek Chat for MASAC. Our results show that LLM-assisted active learning achieves competitive or superior performance compared to human labeling. For example, on the Hunger Station dataset, the LSTM model achieved 93% accuracy with only 450 labeled samples using GPT-4o-generated labels, while on the MASAC dataset, DeepSeek Chat reached 82% accuracy with 650 labeled samples, matching the accuracy obtained through human labeling.

<title>On the Shelf Life of Fine-Tuned LLM Judges: Future Proofing, Backward Compatibility, and Question Generalization</title>

Abstract: The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is widely used in both evaluating free-text model responses and reward modeling for model alignment and finetuning. Recently, finetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred choice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former achieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to common biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical concerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this paper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of these judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges finetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by future models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well judges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three aspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and test distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three different base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging for most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with DPO-trained models consistently improving performance. We further find that continual learning provides a more balanced adaptation to shifts between older and newer response distributions than training solely on stronger or weaker responses. Moreover, all models observe certain degrees of performance degradation when moving from questions seen during training to unseen ones, showing that current judges do not fully generalize to unseen questions. These findings provide insights into practical considerations for developing and deploying judge models in the face of ever-changing generators.

Abstract: Medical dictation systems are essential tools in modern healthcare, enabling accurate and efficient conversion of speech into written medical documentation. The main objective of this paper is to create a domain-specific system for Greek medical speech transcriptions. The ultimate goal is to assist healthcare professionals by reducing the overload of manual documentation and improving workflow efficiency. Towards this goal, we develop a system that combines automatic speech recognition techniques with text correction model, allowing better handling of domain-specific terminology and linguistic variations in Greek. Our approach leverages both acoustic and textual modeling to create more realistic and reliable transcriptions. We focused on adapting existing language and speech technologies to the Greek medical context, addressing challenges such as complex medical terminology and linguistic inconsistencies. Through domain-specific fine-tuning, our system achieves more accurate and coherent transcriptions, contributing to the development of practical language technologies for the Greek healthcare sector.

<title>Towards Efficient CoT Distillation: Self-Guided Rationale Selector for Better Performance with Fewer Rationales</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation aims to enhance small language models' (SLMs) reasoning by transferring multi-step reasoning capability from the larger teacher models. However, existing work underestimates rationale quality, focusing primarily on data quantity, which may transfer noisy or incorrect information to the student model. To address the above issues, we proposed \textbf{M}odel-\textbf{O}riented \textbf{R}ationale \textbf{S}election \textbf{D}istillation (MoRSD), which can discern and select high quality rationales for distillation to improve performance further. We further propose a Rationale Difficulty (RD) metric to measure the ability of the student model to generate the correct answer under a given rationale. Compared to the baseline, we achieved 4.6$\%$ average improvement on seven datasets over three tasks, using fewer rationales by controlling their accuracy, diversity, and difficulty. Our results reveal that a small portion of the high quality rationales can enhance the reasoning ability of student models than the entire dataset. Our method promises to be a possible solution for efficient CoT distillation. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MoRSD.

Abstract: Enterprise teams rely on the Jira Query Language (JQL) to retrieve and filter issues from Jira. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no open, real-world, execution-based benchmark for mapping natural language queries to JQL. We introduce Jackal, a novel, large-scale text-to-JQL benchmark comprising 100,000 natural language (NL) requests paired with validated JQL queries and execution-based results on a live Jira instance with over 200,000 issues. To reflect real-world usage, each JQL query is associated with four types of user requests: (i) Long NL, (ii) Short NL, (iii) Semantically Similar, and (iv) Semantically Exact. We release Jackal, a corpus of 100,000 text-to-JQL pairs, together with an execution-based scoring toolkit, and a static snapshot of the evaluated Jira instance for reproducibility. We report text-to-JQL results on 23 Large Language Models (LLMs) spanning parameter sizes, open and closed source models, across execution accuracy, exact match, and canonical exact match. In this paper, we report results on Jackal-5K, a 5,000-pair subset of Jackal. On Jackal-5K, the best overall model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieves only 60.3% execution accuracy averaged equally across four user request types. Performance varies significantly across user request types: (i) Long NL (86.0%), (ii) Short NL (35.7%), (iii) Semantically Similar (22.7%), and (iv) Semantically Exact (99.3%). By benchmarking LLMs on their ability to produce correct and executable JQL queries, Jackal exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art LLMs and sets a new, execution-based challenge for future research in Jira enterprise data.

<title>LLM Hallucination Detection: HSAD</title>

Abstract: Although Large Language Models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in a wide range of tasks such as language understanding and code generation, the frequent occurrence of hallucinations during the generation process has become a significant impediment to their deployment in critical application scenarios. Current mainstream hallucination detection methods rely on factual consistency verification or static hidden layer features. The former is constrained by the scope of knowledge coverage, while the latter struggles to capture reasoning biases during the inference process. To address these issues, and inspired by signal analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience, this paper proposes a hallucination detection method based on the frequency-domain analysis of hidden layer temporal signals, named HSAD (\textbf{H}idden \textbf{S}ignal \textbf{A}nalysis-based \textbf{D}etection). First, by treating the LLM's reasoning process as a cognitive journey that unfolds over time, we propose modeling and simulating the human process of signal perception and discrimination in a deception-detection scenario through hidden layer temporal signals. Next, The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to map these temporal signals into the frequency domain to construct spectral features, which are used to capture anomalies that arise during the reasoning process; analysis experiments on these spectral features have proven the effectiveness of this approach. Finally, a hallucination detection algorithm is designed based on these spectral features to identify hallucinations in the generated content. By effectively combining the modeling of the reasoning process with frequency-domain feature extraction, the HSAD method overcomes the limitations of existing approaches in terms of knowledge coverage and the detection of reasoning biases, demonstrating higher detection accuracy and robustness.

<title>Timber: Training-free Instruct Model Refining with Base via Effective Rank</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23595</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Post-training, which elicits a pretrained Base model into the corresponding Instruct model, is widely considered to be superficial. In this work, we first reinforce this hypothesis by providing novel quantitative evidence from the weight level that the effective rank (eRank) remains negligibly changed. However, this superficiality also suffers a critical trade-off, improving the exploitation capabilities at the cost of limiting its exploration. To tackle this issue, we propose Timber, a simple yet effective training-free method that enhances the exploration capability of the Instruct model while preserving its exploitation. The key insight is to partially revert Instruct towards the paired Base model by subtle yet targeted refinement of the weight deltas. Extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen series demonstrate that Timber consistently improves vanilla Instruct models, particularly on Pass@k performance. Our findings offer new insights into the post-training stage at the weight level and practical strategies to refine the Instruct model without training.

Abstract: Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on generating explicit tokens step by step, and their effectiveness typically hinges on large-scale supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques substantially enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks, they remain inefficient, requiring long reasoning traces that increase latency and token usage. In this work, we introduce Latent Codebooks for Fast Thinking, a framework that uses concise CoT sketches only during training to learn a codebook of discrete strategy priors. At inference, the model conditions on a handful of continuous thinking vectors distilled from the codebook in a single pass, enabling strategy-level guidance without producing explicit reasoning tokens. To complement this design, we propose GainRouter, a lightweight routing mechanism that adaptively switches between fast codebook guided inference and slow explicit reasoning, thereby suppressing overthinking and reducing unnecessary token generation. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our approach achieves competitive or superior accuracy while substantially lowering inference cost, offering a practical path toward efficient and controllable reasoning in large language models.

Abstract: Mask-based Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) struggle to revise incorrect tokens: once a token is generated, it typically remains fixed. The key challenge is to identify potential errors in the inputs. In this paper, we propose \emph{\underline{Rem}asking-\underline{e}nabled \underline{Di}ffusion Language Model (RemeDi}, a mask-based DLM that introduces \emph{remasking} as another fundamental mechanism, enabling more flexible text refinement in diffusion-based text generation. To achieve this, RemeDi jointly predicts token distributions and per-token confidence scores at each step. The confidence scores determine which tokens to be unmasked after the current step, allowing the model to identify tokens with low quality and remask them. These remasked tokens can be resampled with richer context in subsequent steps. We design a remask-aware pipeline to train this ability, including supervised fine-tuning which teaches the model to detect and remask incorrect tokens in addition to predict mask tokens, and reinforcement learning which optimizes full generation trajectories toward higher rewards. Experiments show that RemeDi achieves the state-of-the-art results among open-source DLMs on multiple datasets.

Abstract: Enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) attracts widespread attention. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown superior performance for improving complex reasoning, its impact on cross-lingual generalization compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) remains unexplored. We present the first systematic investigation into cross-lingual reasoning generalization of RL and SFT. Using Qwen2.5-3B-Base as our foundation model, we conduct experiments on diverse multilingual reasoning benchmarks, including math reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and scientific reasoning. Our investigation yields two significant findings: (1) Tuning with RL not only achieves higher accuracy but also demonstrates substantially stronger cross-lingual generalization capabilities compared to SFT. (2) RL training on non-English data yields better overall performance and generalization than training on English data, which is not observed with SFT. Furthermore, through comprehensive mechanistic analyses, we explore the underlying factors of RL's superiority and generalization across languages. Our results provide compelling evidence that RL enables the model with more robust reasoning strategies, offering crucial guidance for more equitable and effective multilingual reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain unreliable for global enterprise applications due to substantial performance gaps between high-resource and mid/low-resource languages, driven by English-centric pretraining and internal reasoning biases. This inconsistency undermines customer experience and operational reliability in multilingual settings such as customer support, content moderation, and information retrieval. Even with advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, we observe up to an 29% accuracy drop in non-English languages compared to English.
  We propose a practical, batch-wise alignment strategy for fine-tuning LLMs, leveraging semantically equivalent multilingual data in each training batch to directly align model outputs across languages. This approach improves non-English accuracy by up to 23.9\% without compromising English performance, model reasoning, or retrieval quality. Our method is simple to implement, scalable, and integrates seamlessly with existing LLM training \& deployment pipelines, enabling more robust and equitable multilingual AI solutions in industry.

<title>TF-Bench: Evaluating Program Semantics Reasoning with Type Inference in System F</title>

arXiv:2509.23686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into the software engineering ecosystem. Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM (Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in current LLM capabilities and highlighting essential directions for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results for embodied agents in operating meaningfully in complex, human-centered environments. Yet, evaluating their capacity for nuanced, human-like reasoning and decision-making remains challenging. In this work, we introduce VIVA+, a cognitively grounded benchmark for evaluating the reasoning and decision-making of MLLMs in human-centered situations. VIVA+ consists of 1,317 real-world situations paired with 6,373 multiple-choice questions, targeting three core abilities for decision-making: (1) Foundational Situation Comprehension, (2) Context-Driven Action Justification, and (3) Reflective Reasoning. Together, these dimensions provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to perceive, reason, and act in socially meaningful ways. We evaluate the latest commercial and open-source models on VIVA+, where we reveal distinct performance patterns and highlight significant challenges. We further explore targeted training and multi-step reasoning strategies, which yield consistent performance improvements. Finally, our in-depth analysis highlights current model limitations and provides actionable insights for advancing MLLMs toward more robust, context-aware, and socially adept decision-making in real-world settings.

<title>Collaboration of Fusion and Independence: Hypercomplex-driven Robust Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph Completion</title>

Abstract: Multi-modal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) aims to discover missing facts in multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) by leveraging both structural relationships and diverse modality information of entities. Existing MMKGC methods follow two multi-modal paradigms: fusion-based and ensemble-based. Fusion-based methods employ fixed fusion strategies, which inevitably leads to the loss of modality-specific information and a lack of flexibility to adapt to varying modality relevance across contexts. In contrast, ensemble-based methods retain modality independence through dedicated sub-models but struggle to capture the nuanced, context-dependent semantic interplay between modalities. To overcome these dual limitations, we propose a novel MMKGC method M-Hyper, which achieves the coexistence and collaboration of fused and independent modality representations. Our method integrates the strengths of both paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal interactions while maintaining modality-specific information. Inspired by ``quaternion'' algebra, we utilize its four orthogonal bases to represent multiple independent modalities and employ the Hamilton product to efficiently model pair-wise interactions among them. Specifically, we introduce a Fine-grained Entity Representation Factorization (FERF) module and a Robust Relation-aware Modality Fusion (R2MF) module to obtain robust representations for three independent modalities and one fused modality. The resulting four modality representations are then mapped to the four orthogonal bases of a biquaternion (a hypercomplex extension of quaternion) for comprehensive modality interaction. Extensive experiments indicate its state-of-the-art performance, robustness, and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Ensuring that both new and experienced drivers master current traffic rules is critical to road safety. This paper evaluates Large Language Models (LLMs) on Romanian driving-law QA with explanation generation. We release a 1{,}208-question dataset (387 multimodal) and compare text-only and multimodal SOTA systems, then measure the impact of domain-specific fine-tuning for Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct and RoLlama 3.1-8B-Instruct. SOTA models perform well, but fine-tuned 8B models are competitive. Textual descriptions of images outperform direct visual input. Finally, an LLM-as-a-Judge assesses explanation quality, revealing self-preference bias. The study informs explainable QA for less-resourced languages.

arXiv:2509.23744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) promise enhanced reasoning by integrating diverse inputs such as text, vision, and audio. Yet cross-modal reasoning remains underexplored, with conflicting reports on whether added modalities help or harm performance. These inconsistencies stem from a lack of controlled evaluation frameworks and analysis of models' internals to isolate when and why modality interactions support or undermine reasoning. We address this gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes multimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are distributed across modalities and logically combined. Empirically, additional modalities enhance reasoning only when they provide independent and sufficient reasoning paths, while redundant or chained entailment support often hurts performance. Moreover, reasoning degrades in three systematic ways: weaker modalities drag down overall performance, conflicts bias preference toward certain modalities, and joint signals from different modalities fail to be integrated effectively. Therefore, we identify two core failures: task-composition bottleneck, where recognition and reasoning cannot be jointly executed in one pass, and fusion bottleneck, where early integration introduces bias. For further investigation, we find that attention patterns fail to encode fact usefulness, but a simple two-step prompting (recognize then reason) restores performance, confirming the task-composition bottleneck. Moreover, modality identity remains recoverable in early layers, and softening attention in early fusion improves reasoning, highlighting biased fusion as another failure mode. Overall, our findings show that integration, not perception, is the main barrier to multimodal reasoning, suggesting composition-aware training and early fusion control as promising directions.

Abstract: The integration of speech into Large Language Models (LLMs) has substantially expanded their capabilities, but often at the cost of weakening their core textual competence. This degradation limits the ability of speech-enabled LLMs to fully exploit their pre-trained text-based knowledge. In this work, we analyze the underlying mechanisms of this issue through a focused study of the widely used encoder-adaptor paradigm. We propose an analytical framework based on parameter importance estimation, which reveals that fine-tuning for speech introduces a textual importance distribution shift: the layer-wise allocation of parameters critical to textual reasoning is disrupted. Building on this insight, we investigate two mitigation strategies: layer-wise learning rate scheduling and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), both aim to preserve the original parameter distribution. Experimental results show that both approaches better maintain textual competence than full fine-tuning, while also improving downstream spoken question answering performance. Furthermore, our analysis offers a principled explanation for the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies, linking their benefits to the structural properties of textual knowledge in LLMs.

<title>Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning: Dual-Fact Alignment for Long-Form Factuality</title>

arXiv:2509.23765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hallucination and factuality deficits remain key obstacles to the reliability of large language models (LLMs) in long-form generation. Existing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) frameworks primarily rely on preference rewards, yet they often overlook the model's internal knowledge boundaries, exacerbating the so-called "hallucination tax". To address this challenge, we propose Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning Framework (KLCF), a novel framework that focuses on the knowledge consistency between the policy model's expressed knowledge and the base model's parametric knowledge, and introduces a Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism to jointly optimize factual recall and precision. Specifically, KLCF leverages pretrained knowledge boundaries to construct fact checklist, guiding online reinforcement learning to improve factual coverage and recall; simultaneously, it trains a self-assessment module based on the base model's internal knowledge to enhance factual precision during generation. Unlike prior methods that rely on external retrieval or heavy verification, our reward design is fully external-knowledge-free and lightweight, making KLCF efficient and easily scalable to large-scale training. Experimental results demonstrate that KLCF substantially improves factuality metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model hallucinations.

<title>From Personal to Collective: On the Role of Local and Global Memory in LLM Personalization</title>

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) personalization aims to tailor model behavior to individual users based on their historical interactions. However, its effectiveness is often hindered by two key challenges: the \textit{cold-start problem}, where users with limited history provide insufficient context for accurate personalization, and the \textit{biasing problem}, where users with abundant but skewed history cause the model to overfit to narrow preferences. We identify both issues as symptoms of a common underlying limitation, i.e., the inability to model collective knowledge across users. To address this, we propose a local-global memory framework (LoGo) that combines the personalized local memory with a collective global memory that captures shared interests across the population. To reconcile discrepancies between these two memory sources, we introduce a mediator module designed to resolve conflicts between local and global signals. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoGo consistently improves personalization quality by both warming up cold-start users and mitigating biased predictions. These results highlight the importance of incorporating collective knowledge to enhance LLM personalization.

<title>Bridging the Knowledge-Prediction Gap in LLMs on Multiple-Choice Questions</title>

arXiv:2509.23782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) despite demonstrating correct knowledge in other contexts, such as free-form generation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this knowledge-prediction gap on MCQs and alleviate it, we conduct a probing analysis and find that residual streams in certain layers contain a subspace spanned by two important bases: a \emph{knowledge basis} that encodes the probability of the ground-truth answer for a given MCQ and a \emph{prediction basis} that encodes the probability of the answer choice predicted by the model. We observe that incorrect predictions arise from a misalignment of the model's hidden states along these two bases. Hence, we introduce \textbf{KAPPA} (Knowledge-Aligned Prediction through Projection-based Adjustment), a parameter-free intervention that transforms the hidden states to align the prediction coordinate with the knowledge coordinate within this subspace. Experiments on binary-choice reformulations of Big-Bench-Hard and ARC-Challenge show that KAPPA substantially improves accuracy and consistently outperforms baselines. While optimal subspaces differ across tasks, subspaces generalize to some extent, as supported by cross-dataset experiments. Moreover, KAPPA extends its effectiveness to free-form questions beyond MCQs. Our work provides a new geometric understanding of the knowledge-prediction gap and offers a practical method for better aligning model behavior with its latent knowledge.

Abstract: This paper presents our submission to the QIAS 2025 shared task on Islamic knowledge understanding and reasoning. We developed a hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system that combines sparse and dense retrieval methods with cross-encoder reranking to improve large language model (LLM) performance. Our three-stage pipeline incorporates BM25 for initial retrieval, a dense embedding retrieval model for semantic matching, and cross-encoder reranking for precise content retrieval. We evaluate our approach on both subtasks using two LLMs, Fanar and Mistral, demonstrating that the proposed RAG pipeline enhances performance across both, with accuracy improvements up to 25%, depending on the task and model configuration. Our best configuration is achieved with Fanar, yielding accuracy scores of 45% in Subtask 1 and 80% in Subtask 2.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success on question answering (QA) tasks, yet they often encode harmful biases that compromise fairness and trustworthiness. Most existing bias mitigation approaches are restricted to predefined categories, limiting their ability to address novel or context-specific emergent biases. To bridge this gap, we tackle the novel problem of open-set bias detection and mitigation in text-based QA. We introduce OpenBiasBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate biases across a wide range of categories and subgroups, encompassing both known and previously unseen biases. Additionally, we propose Open-DeBias, a novel, data-efficient, and parameter-efficient debiasing method that leverages adapter modules to mitigate existing social and stereotypical biases while generalizing to unseen ones. Compared to the state-of-the-art BMBI method, Open-DeBias improves QA accuracy on BBQ dataset by nearly $48\%$ on ambiguous subsets and $6\%$ on disambiguated ones, using adapters fine-tuned on just a small fraction of the training data. Remarkably, the same adapters, in a zero-shot transfer to Korean BBQ, achieve $84\%$ accuracy, demonstrating robust language-agnostic generalization. Through extensive evaluation, we also validate the effectiveness of Open-DeBias across a broad range of NLP tasks, including StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs, highlighting its robustness, multilingual strength, and suitability for general-purpose, open-domain bias mitigation.

<title>SPELL: Self-Play Reinforcement Learning for evolving Long-Context Language Models</title>

Abstract: Progress in long-context reasoning for large language models (LLMs) has lagged behind other recent advances. This gap arises not only from the intrinsic difficulty of processing long texts, but also from the scarcity of reliable human annotations and programmatically verifiable reward signals. In this paper, we propose SPELL, a multi-role self-play reinforcement learning framework that enables scalable, label-free optimization for long-context reasoning. SPELL integrates three cyclical roles-questioner, responder, and verifier-within a single model to enable continual self-improvement. The questioner generates questions from raw documents paired with reference answers; the responder learns to solve these questions based on the documents; and the verifier evaluates semantic equivalence between the responder's output and the questioner's reference answer, producing reward signals to guide continual training. To stabilize training, we introduce an automated curriculum that gradually increases document length and a reward function that adapts question difficulty to the model's evolving capabilities. Extensive experiments on six long-context benchmarks show that SPELL consistently improves performance across diverse LLMs and outperforms equally sized models fine-tuned on large-scale annotated data. Notably, SPELL achieves an average 7.6-point gain in pass@8 on the strong reasoning model Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, raising its performance ceiling and showing promise for scaling to even more capable models.

<title>Winning the Pruning Gamble: A Unified Approach to Joint Sample and Token Pruning for Efficient Supervised Fine-Tuning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23873</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23873</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As supervised fine-tuning (SFT) evolves from a lightweight post-training step into a compute-intensive phase rivaling mid-training in scale, data efficiency has become critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) under tight budgets. Existing data pruning methods suffer from a fragmented design: they operate either at the sample level or the token level in isolation, failing to jointly optimize both dimensions. This disconnect leads to significant inefficiencies--high-value samples may still contain redundant tokens, while token-level pruning often discards crucial instructional or corrective signals embedded in individual examples. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the Error-Uncertainty (EU) Plane, a diagnostic framework that jointly characterizes the heterogeneous utility of training data across samples and tokens. Guided by this insight, we propose Quadrant-based Tuning (Q-Tuning), a unified framework that strategically coordinates sample pruning and token pruning. Q-Tuning employs a two-stage strategy: first, it performs sample-level triage to retain examples rich in informative misconceptions or calibration signals; second, it applies an asymmetric token-pruning policy, using a context-aware scoring mechanism to trim less salient tokens exclusively from misconception samples while preserving calibration samples in their entirety. Our method sets a new state of the art across five diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, on SmolLM2-1.7B, Q-Tuning achieves a +38\% average improvement over the full-data SFT baseline using only 12.5\% of the original training data. As the first dynamic pruning approach to consistently outperform full-data training, Q-Tuning provides a practical and scalable blueprint for maximizing data utilization in budget-constrained LLM SFT.

<title>DocPruner: A Storage-Efficient Framework for Multi-Vector Visual Document Retrieval via Adaptive Patch-Level Embedding Pruning</title>

arXiv:2509.23883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Document Retrieval (VDR), the task of retrieving visually-rich document pages using queries that combine visual and textual cues, is crucial for numerous real-world applications. Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in a multi-vector paradigm, representing each document as patch-level embeddings to capture fine-grained details. While highly effective, this approach introduces a critical challenge: prohibitive storage overhead, as storing hundreds of vectors per page makes large-scale deployment costly and impractical. To address this, we introduce DocPruner, the first framework to employ adaptive patch-level embedding pruning for VDR to effectively reduce the storage overhead. DocPruner leverages the intra-document patch attention distribution to dynamically identify and discard redundant embeddings for each document. This adaptive mechanism enables a significant 50-60% reduction in storage for leading multi-vector VDR models with negligible degradation in document retrieval performance. Extensive experiments across more than ten representative datasets validate that DocPruner offers a robust, flexible, and effective solution for building storage-efficient, large-scale VDR systems.

<title>Taming Masked Diffusion Language Models via Consistency Trajectory Reinforcement Learning with Fewer Decoding Step</title>

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) language models, offering properties such as parallel decoding, flexible generation orders, and the potential for fewer inference steps. Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored. A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal (parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding, achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO) for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks, such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct. The results demonstrate that the proposed EOSER and ASS mechanisms, together with CJ-GRPO, hold significant promise for effectively and efficiently taming MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/yjyddq/EOSER-ASS-RL.

Abstract: Prior work has largely treated future event prediction as a static task, failing to consider how forecasts and the confidence in them should evolve as new evidence emerges. To address this gap, we introduce EVOLVECAST, a framework for evaluating whether large language models appropriately revise their predictions in response to new information. In particular, EVOLVECAST assesses whether LLMs adjust their forecasts when presented with information released after their training cutoff. We use human forecasters as a comparative reference to analyze prediction shifts and confidence calibration under updated contexts. While LLMs demonstrate some responsiveness to new information, their updates are often inconsistent or overly conservative. We further find that neither verbalized nor logits-based confidence estimates consistently outperform the other, and both remain far from the human reference standard. Across settings, models tend to express conservative bias, underscoring the need for more robust approaches to belief updating.

<title>Easy Turn: Integrating Acoustic and Linguistic Modalities for Robust Turn-Taking in Full-Duplex Spoken Dialogue Systems</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23938</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full-duplex interaction is crucial for natural human-machine communication, yet remains challenging as it requires robust turn-taking detection to decide when the system should speak, listen, or remain silent. Existing solutions either rely on dedicated turn-taking models, most of which are not open-sourced. The few available ones are limited by their large parameter size or by supporting only a single modality, such as acoustic or linguistic. Alternatively, some approaches finetune LLM backbones to enable full-duplex capability, but this requires large amounts of full-duplex data, which remain scarce in open-source form. To address these issues, we propose Easy Turn, an open-source, modular turn-taking detection model that integrates acoustic and linguistic bimodal information to predict four dialogue turn states: complete, incomplete, backchannel, and wait, accompanied by the release of Easy Turn trainset, a 1,145-hour speech dataset designed for training turn-taking detection models. Compared to existing open-source models like TEN Turn Detection and Smart Turn V2, our model achieves state-of-the-art turn-taking detection accuracy on our open-source Easy Turn testset. The data and model will be made publicly available on GitHub.

<title>Vision-Grounded Machine Interpreting: Improving the Translation Process through Visual Cues</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23957</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.23957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine Interpreting systems are currently implemented as unimodal, real-time speech-to-speech architectures, processing translation exclusively on the basis of the linguistic signal. Such reliance on a single modality, however, constrains performance in contexts where disambiguation and adequacy depend on additional cues, such as visual, situational, or pragmatic information. This paper introduces Vision-Grounded Interpreting (VGI), a novel approach designed to address the limitations of unimodal machine interpreting. We present a prototype system that integrates a vision-language model to process both speech and visual input from a webcam, with the aim of priming the translation process through contextual visual information. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we constructed a hand-crafted diagnostic corpus targeting three types of ambiguity. In our evaluation, visual grounding substantially improves lexical disambiguation, yields modest and less stable gains for gender resolution, and shows no benefit for syntactic ambiguities. We argue that embracing multimodality represents a necessary step forward for advancing translation quality in machine interpreting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve accuracy on complex tasks. However, always generating lengthy reasoning traces is inefficient, leading to excessive token usage and higher inference costs. This paper introduces the Hybrid Policy Optimization (i.e., HiPO), a framework for adaptive reasoning control that enables LLMs to selectively decide when to engage in detailed reasoning (Think-on) and when to respond directly (Think-off). Specifically, HiPO combines a hybrid data pipelineproviding paired Think-on and Think-off responseswith a hybrid reinforcement learning reward system that balances accuracy and efficiency while avoiding over-reliance on detailed reasoning. Experiments across mathematics and coding benchmarks demonstrate that HiPO can substantially reduce token length while maintaining or improving accuracy. Finally, we hope HiPO a can be a principled approach for efficient adaptive reasoning, advancing the deployment of reasoning-oriented LLMs in real-world, resource-sensitive settings.

Abstract: Simulating interactive world models remains a core challenge in Large Language Models(LLMs). In this work, we introduce the ByteSized32Refactored, a refactored, modular, and extensible implementation of the original ByteSized32 corpus to explore the task of text game generation. We further optimize the code structure of each text game and create the GameBasic.py foundation library, which centralizes common logic across all 32 games by abstracting 7 base classes (GameObject, etc.) into reusable modules, thereby reducing from 20k to 10k total lines of Python code compared to the original Bytesized32. Our refactored implementation enables extendability - with our centralized design, ByteSized32Refactored can be more efficiently extended to include text games of new scenarios and specifications by reusing the shared logic and functionalities. Extensive experiments with GPT-4o demonstrate a mix of performance - with Bytesized32Refactored, the generated text games for unseen scenarios showcase quality improvements on two of the four evaluation dimensions while decreases on the other two, indicating that the hierarchical structure of the refactored code presents new challenges for LLMs. Overall, we highlight that our extensible code structure, centered on the foundation library and the modular optimization, not only facilitates LLM adaptation to environment specifications but also establishes a scalable environment that supports future extensions.

Abstract: Preference alignment is a critical step in making Large Language Models (LLMs) useful and aligned with (human) preferences. Existing approaches such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Direct Preference Optimization typically require curated data and expensive optimization over billions of parameters, and eventually lead to persistent task-specific models. In this work, we introduce Preference alignment of Large Language Models via Residual Steering (PaLRS), a training-free method that exploits preference signals encoded in the residual streams of LLMs. From as few as one hundred preference pairs, PaLRS extracts lightweight, plug-and-play steering vectors that can be applied at inference time to push models toward preferred behaviors. We evaluate PaLRS on various small-to-medium-scale open-source LLMs, showing that PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline general-purpose performance. Moreover, when compared to DPO-aligned models, they perform better with huge time savings. Our findings highlight that PaLRS offers an effective, much more efficient and flexible alternative to standard preference optimization pipelines, offering a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism for alignment with minimal data.

<title>The Hidden Costs of Translation Accuracy: Distillation, Quantization, and Environmental Impact</title>

arXiv:2509.23990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs) has heightened concerns about their computational and environmental costs. This study investigates the trade-offs between translation quality and efficiency by comparing full-scale, distilled, and quantized models using machine translation as a case study. We evaluated performance on the Flores+ benchmark and through human judgments of conversational translations in French, Hindi, and Kannada. Our analysis of carbon emissions per evaluation run revealed that the full 3.3B fp32 model, while achieving the highest BLEU scores, incurred the largest environmental footprint (about 0.007-0.008 kg CO2 per run). The distilled models achieved an inference of up to 4.5x faster than the full 3.3B model, with only minimal reductions in BLEU scores. Human evaluations also showed that even aggressive quantization (INT4) preserved high levels of accuracy and fluency, with differences between models generally minor. These findings demonstrate that model compression strategies can substantially reduce computational demands and environmental impact while maintaining competitive translation quality, though trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings. We argue for evaluation frameworks that integrate efficiency and sustainability alongside objective metrics as central dimensions of progress in NLP.

Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in industry, it is essential to safeguard them.

We introduce "Policy as Prompt," a new approach that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret and enforce natural language policies by applying contextual understanding and the principle of least privilege. Our system first ingests technical artifacts to construct a verifiable policy tree, which is then compiled into lightweight, prompt-based classifiers that audit agent behavior at runtime. We validate our approach across diverse applications, demonstrating a scalable and auditable pipeline that bridges the critical policy-to-practice gap, paving the way for verifiably safer and more regulatable AI.

arXiv:2509.24002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MCP standardizes how LLMs interact with external systems, forming the foundation for general agents. However, existing MCP benchmarks remain narrow in scope: they focus on read-heavy tasks or tasks with limited interaction depth, and fail to capture the complexity and realism of real-world workflows. To address this gap, we propose MCPMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate MCP use in a more realistic and comprehensive manner. It consists of $127$ high-quality tasks collaboratively created by domain experts and AI agents. Each task begins with a curated initial state and includes a programmatic script for automatic verification. These tasks demand richer and more diverse interactions with the environment, involving a broad range of create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of cutting-edge LLMs using a minimal agent framework that operates in a tool-calling loop. Empirical results show that the best-performing model, gpt-5-medium, reaches only $52.56$\% pass@1 and $33.86$\% pass^4, while other widely regarded strong models, including claude-sonnet-4 and o3, fall below $30$\% pass@1 and $15$\% pass^4. On average, LLMs require $16.2$ execution turns and $17.4$ tool calls per task, significantly surpassing those in previous MCP benchmarks and highlighting the stress-testing nature of MCPMark.

arXiv:2509.24007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have strong theoretical efficiency but are limited by fixed-length decoding and incompatibility with key-value (KV) caches. Block diffusion mitigates these issues, yet still enforces a fixed block size and requires expensive training. We introduce Next Sequence Prediction (NSP), which unifies next-token and next-block prediction, enabling the model to adaptively determine the generation length at each step. When the length is fixed to 1, NSP reduces to standard next-token prediction. Building on NSP, we propose Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM), which can retrofit pre-trained autoregressive language models (ALMs) at minimal cost. Specifically, SDLM performs diffusion inference within fixed-size mask blocks, but dynamically decodes consecutive subsequences based on model confidence, thereby preserving KV-cache compatibility and improving robustness to varying uncertainty and semantics across the sequence. Experiments show that SDLM matches or surpasses strong autoregressive baselines using only 3.5M training samples, while achieving 2.1 higher throughput than Qwen-2.5. Notably, the SDLM-32B model delivers even more pronounced efficiency gains, demonstrating the strong scalability potential of our modeling paradigm.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative to autoregressive models (ARs), existing open-source DLMs suffer from high inference latency. This bottleneck is mainly due to the attention's quadratic complexity with respect to context length in computing all query-key pairs. Intuitively, to reduce this complexity, a natural strategy is to restrict attention to sparse patterns that retain only the most relevant connections. Such approaches are well-established in ARs, where attention follows fixed and clearly defined sparse patterns. However, in DLMs, we observe distinct sparsity behaviors: (1) attention patterns vary across heads, (2) attention patterns in each head remain highly similar across denoising steps, and (3) early denoising steps are critical for generation. These findings render sparse attention methods designed for ARs largely incompatible with DLMs, as they fail to capture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation when applied in early denoising steps. To address these challenges, we propose SparseD, a novel sparse attention method for DLMs. Leveraging the observations, SparseD only requires pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns one time, and reuses them across all steps. This prevents recomputing sparse patterns at each denoising step. Meanwhile, SparseD uses full attention in the early steps, then switches to sparse attention later to maintain generation quality. Together, these establish SparseD as a practical and efficient solution for deploying DLMs in long-context applications. Experimental results demonstrate that SparseD achieves lossless acceleration, delivering up to $1.50\times$ speedup over FlashAttention at a 64k context length with 1,024 denoising steps.

Abstract: Sequence classification is essential in NLP for understanding and categorizing language patterns in tasks like sentiment analysis, intent detection, and topic classification. Transformer-based models, despite achieving state-of-the-art performance, have inherent limitations due to quadratic time and memory complexity, restricting their input length. Although extensive efforts have aimed at reducing computational demands, processing extensive contexts remains challenging.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose ResFormer, a novel neural network architecture designed to model varying context lengths efficiently through a cascaded methodology. ResFormer integrates an reservoir computing network featuring a nonlinear readout to effectively capture long-term contextual dependencies in linear time. Concurrently, short-term dependencies within sentences are modeled using a conventional Transformer architecture with fixed-length inputs.
  Experiments demonstrate that ResFormer significantly outperforms baseline models of DeepSeek-Qwen and ModernBERT, delivering an accuracy improvement of up to +22.3% on the EmoryNLP dataset and consistent gains on MultiWOZ, MELD, and IEMOCAP. In addition, ResFormer exhibits reduced memory consumption, underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency in modeling extensive contextual information.

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a very important natural language processing activity in which one identifies the polarity of a text, whether it conveys positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Along with the growth of social media and the Internet, the significance of sentiment analysis has grown across numerous industries such as marketing, politics, and customer service. Sentiment analysis is flawed, however, when applied to foreign languages, particularly when there is no labelled data to train models upon. In this study, we present a transformer ensemble model and a large language model (LLM) that employs sentiment analysis of other languages. We used multi languages dataset. Sentiment was then assessed for sentences using an ensemble of pre-trained sentiment analysis models: bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment, and XLM-R. Our experimental results indicated that sentiment analysis performance was more than 86% using the proposed method.

<title>Large-Scale Constraint Generation - Can LLMs Parse Hundreds of Constraints?</title>

Abstract: Recent research has explored the constrained generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) when explicitly prompted by few task-specific requirements. In contrast, we introduce Large-Scale Constraint Generation (LSCG), a new problem that evaluates whether LLMs can parse a large, fine-grained, generic list of constraints. To examine the LLMs' ability to handle an increasing number constraints, we create a practical instance of LSCG, called Words Checker. In Words Checker, we evaluate the impact of model characteristics (e.g., size, family) and steering techniques (e.g., Simple Prompt, Chain of Thought, Best of N) on performance. We also propose FoCusNet, a small and dedicated model that parses the original list of constraints into a smaller subset, helping the LLM focus on relevant constraints. Experiments reveal that existing solutions suffer a significant performance drop as the number of constraints increases, with FoCusNet showing an 8-13% accuracy boost.

Abstract: Since the advent of large language models (LLMs), research has focused on instruction following and deductive reasoning. A central question remains: can these models discover new knowledge, and how can we evaluate this ability? We address this by studying abductive reasoning-the generation of plausible hypotheses to explain observations-and introduce GEAR (General Evaluation for Abductive Reasoning), a general-purpose, fully automated, transparent, and label-free evaluation paradigm. GEAR scores hypothesis sets by three metrics: consistency (each hypothesis explains the observations), generalizability (consistent hypotheses make meaningful predictions on unseen inputs), and diversity (the set covers distinct predictions and patterns). Built this way, GEAR is scalable (no human gold answers), reliable (deterministic scoring aligned with classical abduction), and open-ended (scores improve only when models produce new plausible hypotheses, unlike static benchmarks that saturate once accuracy is high). Using GEAR, we conduct a fine-grained study of nine LLMs on four abduction benchmarks with 1,500 problems, generating over 50,000 candidate hypotheses and revealing model differences obscured by gold-answer or purely human evaluations. We further propose a momentum-based curriculum that adjusts GEAR-derived training data by learning velocity: it starts with what the model learns quickly and shifts toward harder objectives such as generating diverse hypotheses once the model is confident on foundational objectives. Without gold-label supervision, this strategy improves all GEAR objectives and these gains transfer to established abductive reasoning benchmarks. Taken together, GEAR provides a principled framework that evaluates abduction and supplies label-free, scalable training signals that help LLMs produce more diverse and reliable hypotheses.

Abstract: Sentiment Analysis (SA) models harbor inherent social biases that can be harmful in real-world applications. These biases are identified by examining the output of SA models for sentences that only vary in the identity groups of the subjects. Constructing natural, linguistically rich, relevant, and diverse sets of sentences that provide sufficient coverage over the domain is expensive, especially when addressing a wide range of biases: it requires domain experts and/or crowd-sourcing. In this paper, we present a novel bias testing framework, BTC-SAM, which generates high-quality test cases for bias testing in SA models with minimal specification using Large Language Models (LLMs) for the controllable generation of test sentences. Our experiments show that relying on LLMs can provide high linguistic variation and diversity in the test sentences, thereby offering better test coverage compared to base prompting methods even for previously unseen biases.

<title>Pragmatic Inference for Moral Reasoning Acquisition: Generalization via Distributional Semantics</title>

Abstract: Moral reasoning has emerged as a promising research direction for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet achieving generalization remains a central challenge. From a linguistic standpoint, this difficulty arises because LLMs are adept at capturing distributional semantics, which fundamentally differs from the morals which operate at the pragmatic level. This paper investigates how LLMs can achieve generalized moral reasoning despite their reliance on distributional semantics. We propose pragmatic inference methods grounded in moral foundations theory, which leverage contextual information at each step to bridge the pragmatic gap and guide LLMs in connecting moral foundations with moral reasoning objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances LLMs' generalization in moral reasoning, providing a foundation for future research grounded in moral foundations theory.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have seen promising advances, yet they are still limited in "hard-exploration" tasks requiring learning new knowledge through exploration. We present GLoW, a novel approach leveraging dual-scale world models, maintaining a trajectory frontier of high-value discoveries at the global scale, while learning from local trial-and-error in exploration through a Multi-path Advantage Reflection mechanism which infers advantage-based progress signals to guide exploration. To evaluate our framework for hard-exploration, we tackle the Jericho benchmark suite of text-based games, where GLoW achieves a new state-of-theart performance for LLM-based approaches. Compared to state-of-the-art RLbased methods, our approach achieves comparable performance while requiring 100-800x fewer environment interactions.

Abstract: As digital platforms redefine educational paradigms, ensuring interactivity remains vital for effective learning. This paper explores using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to automatically respond to student questions from online lectures - a novel question answering task of real world significance. We introduce the EduVidQA Dataset with 5252 question-answer pairs (both synthetic and real-world) from 296 computer science videos covering diverse topics and difficulty levels. To understand the needs of the dataset and task evaluation, we empirically study the qualitative preferences of students, which we provide as an important contribution to this line of work. Our benchmarking experiments consist of 6 state-of-the-art MLLMs, through which we study the effectiveness of our synthetic data for finetuning, as well as showing the challenging nature of the task. We evaluate the models using both text-based and qualitative metrics, thus showing a nuanced perspective of the models' performance, which is paramount to future work. This work not only sets a benchmark for this important problem, but also opens exciting avenues for future research in the field of Natural Language Processing for Education.

<title>Beyond Magic Words: Sharpness-Aware Prompt Evolving for Robust Large Language Models with TARE</title>

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on carefully engineered prompts. However, prevailing prompt optimization methods, ranging from heuristic edits and reinforcement learning to evolutionary search, primarily target point-wise accuracy. They seldom enforce paraphrase invariance or searching stability, and therefore cannot remedy this brittleness in practice. Automated prompt search remains brittle: small, semantically preserving paraphrases often cause large performance swings. We identify this brittleness as the textual sharpness of the prompt landscape. In this work, we provide the first formal treatment of textual sharpness in the discrete, semantic space of prompts, together with an operational robustness criterion over a semantic neighborhood; the design is black-box or API-only, requiring no gradients to update the model's parameters. Then we introduce TARE (Textual Sharpness-Aware Evolving), a derivative-free framework that alternates between an inner, sampling-based adversarial search that stresses a prompt with hard paraphrases and an outer, robust selection that prefers candidates whose neighborhoods remain strong. We further propose ATARE, which learns anisotropic weights to shape the semantic neighborhood and adapts its radius over time to balance exploration and fidelity. Diverse tasks evaluate our methods, whose design for minimizing textual sharpness gap leads to prompts that preserve accuracy under paraphrasing, outperforming accuracy-only prompt search while remaining computationally practical.

<title>Your thoughts tell who you are: Characterize the reasoning patterns of LRMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24147</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current comparisons of large reasoning models (LRMs) focus on macro-level statistics such as task accuracy or reasoning length. Whether different LRMs reason differently remains an open question. To address this gap, we introduce the LLM-proposed Open Taxonomy (LOT), a classification method that uses a generative language model to compare reasoning traces from two LRMs and articulate their distinctive features in words. LOT then models how these features predict the source LRM of a reasoning trace based on their empirical distributions across LRM outputs. Iterating this process over a dataset of reasoning traces yields a human-readable taxonomy that characterizes how models think. We apply LOT to compare the reasoning of 12 open-source LRMs on tasks in math, science, and coding. LOT identifies systematic differences in their thoughts, achieving 80-100% accuracy in distinguishing reasoning traces from LRMs that differ in scale, base model family, or objective domain. Beyond classification, LOT's natural-language taxonomy provides qualitative explanations of how LRMs think differently. Finally, in a case study, we link the reasoning differences to performance: aligning the reasoning style of smaller Qwen3 models with that of the largest Qwen3 during test time improves their accuracy on GPQA by 3.3-5.7%.

<title>Localizing Task Recognition and Task Learning in In-Context Learning via Attention Head Analysis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanistic underpinnings of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models by reconciling two dominant perspectives: the component-level analysis of attention heads and the holistic decomposition of ICL into Task Recognition (TR) and Task Learning (TL). We propose a novel framework based on Task Subspace Logit Attribution (TSLA) to identify attention heads specialized in TR and TL, and demonstrate their distinct yet complementary roles. Through correlation analysis, ablation studies, and input perturbations, we show that the identified TR and TL heads independently and effectively capture the TR and TL components of ICL. Using steering experiments with geometric analysis of hidden states, we reveal that TR heads promote task recognition by aligning hidden states with the task subspace, while TL heads rotate hidden states within the subspace toward the correct label to facilitate prediction. We further show how previous findings on ICL mechanisms, including induction heads and task vectors, can be reconciled with our attention-head-level analysis of the TR-TL decomposition. Our framework thus provides a unified and interpretable account of how large language models execute ICL across diverse tasks and settings.

<title>Task Vectors, Learned Not Extracted: Performance Gains and Mechanistic Insight</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform new tasks from in-context demonstrations, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent work suggests that these demonstrations are compressed into task vectors (TVs), compact task representations that LLMs exploit for predictions. However, prior studies typically extract TVs from model outputs or hidden states using cumbersome and opaque methods, and they rarely elucidate the mechanisms by which TVs influence computation. In this work, we address both limitations. First, we propose directly training Learned Task Vectors (LTVs), which surpass extracted TVs in accuracy and exhibit superior flexibility-acting effectively at arbitrary layers, positions, and even with ICL prompts. Second, through systematic analysis, we investigate the mechanistic role of TVs, showing that at the low level they steer predictions primarily through attention-head OV circuits, with a small subset of "key heads" most decisive. At a higher level, we find that despite Transformer nonlinearities, TV propagation is largely linear: early TVs are rotated toward task-relevant subspaces to improve logits of relevant labels, while later TVs are predominantly scaled in magnitude. Taken together, LTVs not only provide a practical approach for obtaining effective TVs but also offer a principled lens into the mechanistic foundations of ICL.

Abstract: GUI agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) show promise in automating complex digital tasks. However, their effectiveness in real-world applications is often limited by scarce training data and the inherent complexity of these tasks, which frequently require long-tailed knowledge covering rare, unseen scenarios. We propose RAG-GUI , a lightweight VLM that leverages web tutorials at inference time. RAG-GUI is first warm-started via supervised finetuning (SFT) and further refined through self-guided rejection sampling finetuning (RSF). Designed to be model-agnostic, RAG-GUI functions as a generic plug-in that enhances any VLM-based agent. Evaluated across three distinct tasks, it consistently outperforms baseline agents and surpasses other inference baselines by 2.6% to 13.3% across two model sizes, demonstrating strong generalization and practical plug-and-play capabilities in real-world scenarios.

<title>Beyond Overall Accuracy: A Psychometric Deep Dive into the Topic-Specific Medical Capabilities of 80 Large Language Models</title>

arXiv:2509.24186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for high-stakes medical applications, there has emerged a critical need for reliable and accurate evaluation methodologies. Traditional accuracy metrics fail inadequately as they neither capture question characteristics nor offer topic-specific insights. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{MedIRT}, a rigorous evaluation framework grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT), the gold standard in high-stakes educational testing. Unlike previous research relying on archival data, we prospectively gathered fresh responses from 80 diverse LLMs on a balanced, 1,100-question USMLE-aligned benchmark. Using one unidimensional two-parameter logistic IRT model per topic, we estimate LLM's latent model ability jointly with question difficulty and discrimination, yielding more stable and nuanced performance rankings than accuracy alone. Notably, we identify distinctive ``spiky'' ability profiles, where overall rankings can be misleading due to highly specialized model abilities. While \texttt{GPT-5} was the top performer in a majority of domains (8 of 11), it was outperformed in Social Science and Communication by \texttt{Claude-3-opus}, demonstrating that even an overall 23rd-ranked model can hold the top spot for specific competencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate IRT's utility in auditing benchmarks by identifying flawed questions. We synthesize these findings into a practical decision-support framework that integrates our multi-factor competency profiles with operational metrics. This work establishes a robust, psychometrically grounded methodology essential for the safe, effective, and trustworthy deployment of LLMs in healthcare.

<title>PET: Preference Evolution Tracking with LLM-Generated Explainable Distribution</title>

Abstract: Understanding how user preference evolves over time is a fundamental challenge central to modern digital ecosystems, for which Large Language Models (LLMs) are an increasingly prominent and popular approach due to their ability to comprehend the rich semantic context within behavioral data. A common practice is to use LLMs to predict a user's next action by directly generating a ranked list of preferred items. Although effective for short-term prediction, the end-to-end generation paradigm inherently limits personalization. Its opaque decision-making process obscures holistic user profiling and exacerbates popularity bias. To address these limitations, we propose Preference Evolution Tracking (PET), a framework that reframes the task as inferring a dynamic probability distribution over a stable and interpretable lattice of preference clusters. By applying logit-probing and generative classification techniques, PET infers a user's preference as a probability distribution, enabling transparent preference learning. On public benchmarks (Yelp, MovieLens), PET improves ranking quality by up to 40% in NDCG over direct generation baselines. On a large-scale, real-world dataset from a short-video platform, it excels at ranking long-tail contents, significantly outperforming a SOTA production model by 7 times in the NDCG score. Ultimately, PET transforms the user profile model from direct preference list generation to a transparent distributional preference mapping, paving the way for more explainable, fair, and diverse personalization systems.

arXiv:2509.24193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Search-augmented LLMs often struggle with complex reasoning tasks due to ineffective multi-hop retrieval and limited reasoning ability. We propose AceSearcher, a cooperative self-play framework that trains a single large language model (LLM) to alternate between two roles: a decomposer that breaks down complex queries and a solver that integrates retrieved contexts for answer generation. AceSearcher couples supervised fine-tuning on a diverse mixture of search, reasoning, and decomposition tasks with reinforcement fine-tuning optimized for final answer accuracy, eliminating the need for intermediate annotations. Extensive experiments on three reasoning-intensive tasks across 10 datasets show that AceSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average exact match improvement of 7.6%. Remarkably, on document-level finance reasoning tasks, AceSearcher-32B matches the performance of the DeepSeek-V3 model using less than 5% of its parameters. Even at smaller scales (1.5B and 8B), AceSearcher often surpasses existing search-augmented LLMs with up to 9x more parameters, highlighting its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness in tackling complex reasoning tasks. Our code will be published at https://github.com/ritaranx/AceSearcher and https://huggingface.co/AceSearcher.

arXiv:2509.24202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings, where overconfident responses can mislead users. Reliable confidence estimation has been shown to enhance trust and task accuracy. Yet existing methods face practical barriers: logits are often hidden, multi-sampling is computationally expensive, and verbalized numerical uncertainty (e.g., giving a 0-100 score) deviates from natural communication. We revisit linguistic confidence (LC), where models express uncertainty through hedging language (e.g., probably, might), offering a lightweight and human-centered alternative. To advance this direction, we (1) release the first diverse, large-scale dataset of hedging expressions with human-annotated confidence scores, and (2) propose a lightweight mapper that converts hedges into confidence scores at near-zero cost. Building on these resources, we (3) conduct the first systematic study of LC across modern LLMs and QA benchmarks, revealing that while most LLMs underperform in expressing reliable LC, carefully designed prompting achieves competitive calibration and discriminability. Finally, we (4) introduce a fine-tuning framework that further improves LC reliability. Taken together, our work positions linguistic confidence as a scalable, efficient, and human-aligned approach to LLM uncertainty estimation, and calls for deeper exploration of this promising yet underexplored direction.

Abstract: Evaluating language models fairly is becoming harder as static benchmarks available on the internet risk contamination by training data. This makes it unclear whether models are truly reasoning or just recalling answers. In this paper, we introduce BeyondBench, an evaluation framework that avoids this problem by using algorithmic problem generation. Unlike traditional benchmarks that risk contamination from internet-scale training data, BeyondBench creates mathematically grounded problems on the fly, ensuring each test remains fresh and uncontaminated. Our framework covers 44 algorithmic tasks with a total of 117 variations, grouped into three difficulty levels: the Easy Suite (29 tasks) for basic arithmetic and statistics, the Medium Suite (5 tasks, 49 variations) for sequence patterns and reasoning, and the Hard Suite (10 tasks, 68 variations) tackling NP-complete and constraint satisfaction problems. Each task generates problems from a combinatorial space larger than 10^15 unique instances, with solutions verified deterministically by mathematical proofs. We evaluated 101 language models, including 85 open-source and 16 closed-source models, spanning sizes from 0.5B to 141B parameters and multiple quantization schemes. Our results show consistent reasoning deficiencies across model families, with performance degrading sharply as problem complexity increases from polynomial to exponential. In our Hard Suite evaluations, models such as Gemini-2.5-pro, Llama-3.3-70B, and Qwen2.5-72B achieved average accuracies of 56.38%, 26.91%, and 33.60%, respectively. Moreover, we observe that performance drops drastically without tool usage, with GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5-nano showing a decline of 16.81%, 28.05%, and 47.59% accuracy on the hard suite. Our leaderboard is publicly available at https://ctrl-gaurav.github.io/BeyondBench/

Abstract: ScenarioBench is a policy-grounded, trace-aware benchmark for evaluating Text-to-SQL and retrieval-augmented generation in compliance contexts. Each YAML scenario includes a no-peek gold-standard package with the expected decision, a minimal witness trace, the governing clause set, and the canonical SQL, enabling end-to-end scoring of both what a system decides and why. Systems must justify outputs using clause IDs from the same policy canon, making explanations falsifiable and audit-ready. The evaluator reports decision accuracy, trace quality (completeness, correctness, order), retrieval effectiveness, SQL correctness via result-set equivalence, policy coverage, latency, and an explanation-hallucination rate. A normalized Scenario Difficulty Index (SDI) and a budgeted variant (SDI-R) aggregate results while accounting for retrieval difficulty and time. Compared with prior Text-to-SQL or KILT/RAG benchmarks, ScenarioBench ties each decision to clause-level evidence under strict grounding and no-peek rules, shifting gains toward justification quality under explicit time budgets.

Abstract: Identifying human morals and values embedded in language is essential to empirical studies of communication. However, researchers often face substantial difficulty navigating the diversity of theoretical frameworks and data available for their analysis. Here, we contribute MoVa, a well-documented suite of resources for generalizable classification of human morals and values, consisting of (1) 16 labeled datasets and benchmarking results from four theoretically-grounded frameworks; (2) a lightweight LLM prompting strategy that outperforms fine-tuned models across multiple domains and frameworks; and (3) a new application that helps evaluate psychological surveys. In practice, we specifically recommend a classification strategy, all@once, that scores all related concepts simultaneously, resembling the well-known multi-label classifier chain. The data and methods in MoVa can facilitate many fine-grained interpretations of human and machine communication, with potential implications for the alignment of machine behavior.

Abstract: This paper presents the opdainlp team's solution for the GPU track of the CPDC 2025 challenge. The challenge consists of three tasks, aiming to build an in-game conversational AI that adheres to character personas, aligns with the game's worldview, and supports function calling. Considering both effectiveness and resource/time constraints during inference, we synthesized data for some of the tasks based on the datasets provided by the competition organizers. We employed Qwen3-14B with LoRA fine-tuning and model fusion, and utilized a base model integrated with multiple LoRA adapters during inference. Specifically, in the competition, we used three distinct LoRA adapters to handle tool calling, response generation with tool call results, and response generation without tool call results, respectively. MultiLoRA inference was implemented using vLLM. Our solution achieved the first place in Task 1 and Task 3, and the second place in Task 2 of the GPU track.

Abstract: Prompt optimization and fine-tuning are two major approaches to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). They enhance the capabilities of LLMs from complementary perspectives: the former through explicit natural language, and the latter through implicit parameter updates. However, prior work has typically studied them in isolation, leaving their synergistic potential largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we introduce MetaTuner, a novel framework that jointly integrates prompt optimization and fine-tuning for LLM training. Specifically, we introduce two neural networks to generate prompts and parameters, respectively, while allowing them to share a common bottom encoding layer to enable knowledge sharing. By the guidance of the final supervised signals, our framework is optimized to discover the optimal combinations between the prompts and parameters. Given that prompt learning involves discrete optimization while fine-tuning operates in a continuous parameter space, we design a supervised regularization loss to train our framework effectively. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms the baselines.

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Visual RAG) significantly advances question answering by integrating visual and textual evidence. Yet, current evaluations fail to systematically account for query difficulty and ambiguity. We propose MRAG-Suite, a diagnostic evaluation platform integrating diverse multimodal benchmarks (WebQA, Chart-RAG, Visual-RAG, MRAG-Bench). We introduce difficulty-based and ambiguity-aware filtering strategies, alongside MM-RAGChecker, a claim-level diagnostic tool. Our results demonstrate substantial accuracy reductions under difficult and ambiguous queries, highlighting prevalent hallucinations. MM-RAGChecker effectively diagnoses these issues, guiding future improvements in Visual RAG systems.

<title>SimuHome: A Temporal- and Environment-Aware Benchmark for Smart Home LLM Agents</title>

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at multi-step, tool-augmented tasks. However, smart homes introduce distinct challenges, requiring agents to handle latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, scheduling, and more. The main bottlenecks for developing smart home agents with such capabilities include the lack of a realistic simulation environment where agents can interact with devices and observe the results, as well as a challenging benchmark to evaluate them. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables. By building the simulator on the Matter protocol (the global industry standard for smart home communication), SimuHome provides a high-fidelity environment, and agents validated in SimuHome can be deployed on real Matter-compliant devices with minimal adaptation. We provide a challenging benchmark of 600 episodes across twelve user query types that require the aforementioned capabilities. Our evaluation of 11 agents under a unified ReAct framework reveals that while models perform well on simple tasks, they struggle with latent intent inference, state verification, and especially temporal scheduling. Even the top-performing model, GPT-4.1, reaches only 54% success rate. These findings highlight a critical need for methods that can reliably verify the current state via tools before acting and coordinate time-dependent actions.

<title>Let LLMs Speak Embedding Languages: Generative Text Embeddings via Iterative Contrastive Refinement</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24291</link>

arXiv:2509.24291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing large language model (LLM)-based embeddings typically adopt an encoder-only paradigm, treating LLMs as static feature extractors and overlooking their core generative strengths. We introduce GIRCSE (Generative Iterative Refinement for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings), a novel framework that leverages autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic representations. By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under contrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics that encoder-only methods often miss. To guide this process, we propose an Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective that encourages each refinement step to yield better representations. Extensive experiments show that GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on the MTEB benchmark and instruction-following tasks. Moreover, GIRCSE exhibits an emergent test-time scaling property: generating more tokens at inference steadily improves embedding quality. Our results establish generative iterative refinement as a new paradigm for representation learning.

Abstract: Grounded theory offers deep insights from qualitative data, but its reliance on expert-intensive manual coding presents a major scalability bottleneck. Current computational tools stop short of true automation, keeping researchers firmly in the loop. We introduce LOGOS, a novel, end-to-end framework that fully automates the grounded theory workflow, transforming raw text into a structured, hierarchical theory. LOGOS integrates LLM-driven coding, semantic clustering, graph reasoning, and a novel iterative refinement process to build highly reusable codebooks. To ensure fair comparison, we also introduce a principled 5-dimensional metric and a train-test split protocol for standardized, unbiased evaluation. Across five diverse corpora, LOGOS consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves a remarkable $88.2\%$ alignment with an expert-developed schema on a complex dataset. LOGOS demonstrates a powerful new path to democratize and scale qualitative research without sacrificing theoretical nuance.

<title>DiffuGuard: How Intrinsic Safety is Lost and Found in Diffusion Large Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) introduces unprecedented vulnerabilities that are fundamentally distinct from Autoregressive LLMs, stemming from their iterative and parallel generation mechanisms. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of dLLM vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks across two distinct dimensions: intra-step and inter-step dynamics. Experimental results reveal a harmful bias inherent in the standard greedy remasking strategy and identify a critical phenomenon we term Denoising-path Dependence, where the safety of early-stage tokens decisively influences the final output. These findings also indicate that while current decoding strategies constitute a significant vulnerability, dLLMs possess a substantial intrinsic safety potential. To unlock this potential, we propose DiffuGuard, a training-free defense framework that addresses vulnerabilities through a dual-stage approach: Stochastic Annealing Remasking dynamically introduces controlled randomness to mitigate greedy selection bias, while Block-level Audit and Repair exploits internal model representations for autonomous risk detection and guided correction. Comprehensive experiments on four dLLMs demonstrate DiffuGuard's exceptional effectiveness, reducing Attack Success Rate against six diverse jailbreak methods from 47.9% to 14.7% while preserving model utility and efficiency. Our code is available at: https://github.com/niez233/DiffuGuard.

arXiv:2509.24297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality, multi-modal benchmarks are crucial for advancing scientific reasoning in large models yet their manual creation is costly and unscalable. To address this bottleneck, we explore the potential for transforming Text-Only QA Pairs (TQAs) into high-quality Multi-Modal QA Pairs (MMQAs), which include three parts: 1) Task Definition \& Evaluation Rubric: We develop a TQA-to-MMQA framework and establish a comprehensive, multi-dimensional MMQA quality rubric that provides principles for the transformation. 2) Benchmark Construction: Then we construct two extensive benchmarks to rigorously evaluate state-of-the-art generation \& understanding models on the distinct tasks of MMQA generation \& MMQA quality evaluation. 3) Preliminary Solution: We develop an agentic system (Q-Mirror), which operationalizes our framework by integrating MMQA generation and evaluation into a closed loop for iterative refinement. Our experiments show that while state-of-the-art models can generate MMQAs, their outputs still leave substantial gaps, underscoring the need for reliable evaluation. We further demonstrate that top-tier understanding models align closely with human judgment in MMQA quality assessment. Leveraging both insights, the Q-Mirror agent raises average scores from 78.90 to 85.22 and pass rates from 72\% to 95\%, offering a practical path to large-scale scientific benchmarks.

<title>Dual Mechanisms of Value Expression: Intrinsic vs. Prompted Values in LLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24319</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can express different values in two distinct ways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learned during training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts. Given their widespread use in value alignment and persona steering, it is paramount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularly whether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on substantially different mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this at the mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature directions representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream, and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value expressions. We demonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common components that are crucial for inducing value expression, but also possess unique elements that manifest in different ways. As a result, these mechanisms lead to different degrees of value steerability (prompted > intrinsic) and response diversity (intrinsic > prompted). In particular, components unique to the intrinsic mechanism seem to promote lexical diversity in responses, whereas those specific to the prompted mechanism primarily strengthen instruction following, taking effect even in distant tasks like jailbreaking.

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have driven major advances in language understanding, marking a significant step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). With increasing demands for higher-level semantics and cross-modal fusion, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged, integrating diverse information sources (e.g., text, vision, and audio) to enhance modeling and reasoning in complex scenarios. In AI for Science, multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning has become a rapidly growing frontier. While LLMs and MLLMs have achieved notable progress in this area, the field still lacks a systematic review that consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLMs and MLLMs for emotion recognition and reasoning, covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. We further highlight key challenges and outline future research directions, aiming to offer researchers both an authoritative reference and practical insights for advancing this domain. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to comprehensively survey the intersection of MLLMs with multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning. The summary of existing methods mentioned is in our Github: \href{https://github.com/yuntaoshou/Awesome-Emotion-Reasoning}{https://github.com/yuntaoshou/Awesome-Emotion-Reasoning}.

<title>Speculative Verification: Exploiting Information Gain to Refine Speculative Decoding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24328</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24328</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LLMs have low GPU efficiency and high latency due to autoregressive decoding. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this using a small draft model to speculatively generate multiple tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a target model. However, when speculation accuracy is low, the overhead from rejected tokens can offset the benefits, limiting SD's effectiveness, especially at large batch sizes. To address this, we propose Speculative Verification (SV), an efficient augmentation to SD that dynamically predicts speculation accuracy and adapts the verification length to maximize throughput. SV introduces a companion model - a small auxiliary model similar in size to the draft model - to estimate the alignment between draft and target model distributions. By maximizing the information gain from quantifying this alignment, SV refines verification decisions, reducing wasted computation on rejected tokens and improving decoding efficiency. Moreover, SV requires no modifications to the draft or target models and is compatible with existing SD variants. We extensively evaluated SV on publicly available LLMs across three NLP tasks using nine combinations of draft, companion, and target models, including 13B-72B target models and three types of variations: base (no finetuning), instruction-tuned, and task fine-tuned. Across all experiments and batch sizes (4-80), SV consistently outperforms both SD and standard decoding with the target model. It improves SD performance by up to 2$\times$, with an average speedup of 1.4 $\times$ in large-batch settings (batch sizes 32-80). These results demonstrate SV's robustness, scalability, and practical utility for efficient LLM inference.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) possess impressive multilingual understanding and generation capabilities. However, their performance and cross-lingual alignment often lag for non-dominant languages. A common solution is to fine-tune LLMs on large-scale and more balanced multilingual corpus, but such approaches often lead to imprecise alignment and suboptimal knowledge transfer, struggling with limited improvements across languages. In this paper, we propose AlignX to bridge the multilingual performance gap, which is a two-stage representation-level framework for enhancing multilingual performance of pre-trained LLMs. In the first stage, we align multilingual representations with multilingual semantic alignment and language feature integration. In the second stage, we stimulate the multilingual capability of LLMs via multilingual instruction fine-tuning. Experimental results on several pre-trained LLMs demonstrate that our approach enhances LLMs' multilingual general and cross-lingual generation capability. Further analysis indicates that AlignX brings the multilingual representations closer and improves the cross-lingual alignment.

<title>Beyond Repetition: Text Simplification and Curriculum Learning for Data-Constrained Pretraining</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most studies on language model pretraining focus on large datasets, leaving open questions about optimization in data-constrained settings. In such settings, the effects of training data order and of including alternative versions of the same text remain underexplored. We address this by studying curriculum learning in pretraining, focusing on text-complexity ordering and data augmentation via simplification. We ask: (1) Does simplifying texts enhance representation quality more than reusing the original data? and (2) Does ordering data by text complexity yield better representations? To answer, we build on a pair of parallel corpora where human-written paragraphs are aligned with LLM-simplified variants, and test four data schedules: repeated exposure, low-to-high complexity, high-to-low, and interleaved. We analyze models' representation quality from a sample efficiency perspective via fine-tuning, as well as its zero-shot performance on linguistic knowledge, entity tracking, world knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our findings show that adding simplified data improves fine-tuning and zero-shot performance over a repeated-exposure baseline: smaller models benefit from low-to-high complexity, while larger models perform better with interleaved ordering.

arXiv:2509.24375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of state-of-the-art large language models is commonly understood as a two-stage process involving pre-training and post-training. We point out the need for an additional intermediate stage called reinforcement mid-training with potential for strong performance gains. In this paper, we formally define the problem and identify three key challenges: (1) inefficient training due to excessive reasoning steps, (2) disregard of the imbalanced token entropy distribution, and (3) underutilization of token information. To address these challenges, we propose RMT, a framework for efficient, adaptive, and unified reinforcement mid-training with various innovative components. In particular, we first introduce a dynamic token budget mechanism that constrains unnecessary reasoning steps and mitigates model overthinking. Next, we design a curriculum-based adaptive sampling method that fosters a progressive learning trajectory from easy to hard tokens. Finally, we present a dual training strategy that combines reinforcement learning with next-token prediction, ensuring targeted learning on key tokens and full exploitation of all token information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of RMT over state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to +64.91% performance improvement with only 21% of the reasoning length in language modeling. We also show that checkpoints obtained after reinforcement mid-training can benefit the subsequent post-training, yielding up to +18.76% improvement in the mathematical domain.

Abstract: The alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human values is critical for their safe deployment, yet jailbreak attacks can subvert this alignment to elicit harmful outputs from LLMs. In recent years, a proliferation of jailbreak attacks has emerged, accompanied by diverse metrics and judges to assess the harmfulness of the LLM outputs. However, the absence of a systematic benchmark to assess the quality and effectiveness of these metrics and judges undermines the credibility of the reported jailbreak effectiveness and other risks. To address this gap, we introduce HarmMetric Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to support both overall and fine-grained evaluation of harmfulness metrics and judges. Our benchmark includes a high-quality dataset of representative harmful prompts paired with diverse harmful and non-harmful model responses, alongside a flexible scoring mechanism compatible with various metrics and judges. With HarmMetric Eval, our extensive experiments uncover a surprising result: two conventional metrics--METEOR and ROUGE-1--outperform LLM-based judges in evaluating the harmfulness of model responses, challenging prevailing beliefs about LLMs' superiority in this domain. Our dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/qusgo/HarmMetric_Eval, and the code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HarmMetric-Eval-4CBE.

arXiv:2509.24389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce LLaDA-MoE, a large language diffusion model with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, trained from scratch on approximately 20T tokens. LLaDA-MoE achieves competitive performance with significantly reduced computational overhead by maintaining a 7B-parameter capacity while activating only 1.4B parameters during inference. Our empirical evaluation reveals that LLaDA-MoE achieves state-of-the-art performance among diffusion language models with larger parameters, surpassing previous diffusion language models LLaDA, LLaDA 1.5, and Dream across multiple benchmarks. The instruct-tuned model LLaDA-MoE-7B-A1B-Instruct demonstrates capabilities comparable to Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct in knowledge understanding, code generation, mathematical reasoning, agent and alignment tasks, despite using fewer active parameters. Our results show that integrating a sparse MoE architecture into the training objective of masked diffusion language models still brings out MoE's strengths under efficient inference with few active parameters, and opens ample room for further exploration of diffusion language models. LLaDA-MoE models are available at Huggingface.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Text-to-SQL methods still lag significantly behind human experts on challenging benchmarks like BIRD. Current approaches that explore test-time scaling lack an orchestrated strategy and neglect the model's internal reasoning process. To bridge this gap, we introduce Agentar-Scale-SQL, a novel framework leveraging scalable computation to improve performance. Agentar-Scale-SQL implements an Orchestrated Test-Time Scaling strategy that synergistically combines three distinct perspectives: i) Internal Scaling via RL-enhanced Intrinsic Reasoning, ii) Sequential Scaling through Iterative Refinement, and iii) Parallel Scaling using Diverse Synthesis and Tournament Selection. Agentar-Scale-SQL is a general-purpose framework designed for easy adaptation to new databases and more powerful language models. Extensive experiments show that Agentar-Scale-SQL achieves SOTA performance on the BIRD benchmark, reaching 81.67\% execution accuracy on the test set and ranking first on the official leaderboard, demonstrating an effective path toward human-level performance.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL enables natural access to databases, yet most benchmarks are English-only, limiting multilingual progress. We introduce MultiSpider 2.0, extending Spider 2.0 to eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Vietnamese). It preserves Spider 2.0's structural difficulty while adding linguistic and dialectal variability, demanding deeper reasoning for complex SQL. On this benchmark, state-of-the-art LLMs (such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1) reach only 4\% execution accuracy when relying on intrinsic reasoning, versus 60\% on MultiSpider 1.0. Therefore, we provide a collaboration-driven language agents baseline that iteratively refines queries, improving accuracy to 15\%. These results reveal a substantial multilingual gap and motivate methods that are robust across languages and ready for real-world enterprise deployment. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/phkhanhtrinh23/Multilingual_Text_to_SQL.

arXiv:2509.24422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced their capabilities, highlighting the need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks that extend beyond task-specific benchmarks. However, existing benchmarks often focus on isolated abilities, lacking a holistic framework for assessing LLM capabilities. To address this gap, we propose the Cognition-Domain-Task (CDT) framework, which comprehensively measures a model's capabilities across three dimensions. We expand the scope of model capability definitions at the cognitive level by incorporating the Cattell-Horn-Carroll cognitive theory, refining the categorization of model capabilities. We apply CDT in two directions: dataset capability evaluation and data selection. Experiments show that our capability metrics correlate well with downstream performance and can support effective dataset analysis and construction. The experiments on data selection also show significant improvements in both general and specific benchmarks, achieving scores of 44.3 and 45.4, with an increase of 1.6 and 2.2 points over the baselines, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness and practicality of CDT. Source code and models are available at https://github.com/Alessa-mo/CDT.

Abstract: The paradigm of Next Token Prediction (NTP) has driven the unprecedented success of Large Language Models (LLMs), but is also the source of their most persistent weaknesses such as poor long-term planning, error accumulation, and computational inefficiency. Acknowledging the growing interest in exploring alternatives to NTP, the survey describes the emerging ecosystem of alternatives to NTP. We categorise these approaches into five main families: (1) Multi-Token Prediction, which targets a block of future tokens instead of a single one; (2) Plan-then-Generate, where a global, high-level plan is created upfront to guide token-level decoding; (3) Latent Reasoning, which shifts the autoregressive process itself into a continuous latent space; (4) Continuous Generation Approaches, which replace sequential generation with iterative, parallel refinement through diffusion, flow matching, or energy-based methods; and (5) Non-Transformer Architectures, which sidestep NTP through their inherent model structure. By synthesizing insights across these methods, this survey offers a taxonomy to guide research into models that address the known limitations of token-level generation to develop new transformative models for natural language processing.

<title>Bias Mitigation or Cultural Commonsense? Evaluating LLMs with a Japanese Dataset</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit social biases, prompting the development of various debiasing methods. However, debiasing methods may degrade the capabilities of LLMs. Previous research has evaluated the impact of bias mitigation primarily through tasks measuring general language understanding, which are often unrelated to social biases. In contrast, cultural commonsense is closely related to social biases, as both are rooted in social norms and values. The impact of bias mitigation on cultural commonsense in LLMs has not been well investigated. Considering this gap, we propose SOBACO (SOcial BiAs and Cultural cOmmonsense benchmark), a Japanese benchmark designed to evaluate social biases and cultural commonsense in LLMs in a unified format. We evaluate several LLMs on SOBACO to examine how debiasing methods affect cultural commonsense in LLMs. Our results reveal that the debiasing methods degrade the performance of the LLMs on the cultural commonsense task (up to 75% accuracy deterioration). These results highlight the importance of developing debiasing methods that consider the trade-off with cultural commonsense to improve fairness and utility of LLMs.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.24478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern neural networks have greatly improved performance across speech recognition benchmarks. However, gains are often driven by frequent words with limited semantic weight, which can obscure meaningful differences in word error rate, the primary evaluation metric. Errors in rare terms, named entities, and domain-specific vocabulary are more consequential, but remain hidden by aggregate metrics. This highlights the need for finer-grained error analysis, which depends on accurate alignment between reference and model transcripts. However, conventional alignment methods are not designed for such precision. We propose a novel alignment algorithm that couples dynamic programming with beam search scoring. Compared to traditional text alignment methods, our approach provides more accurate alignment of individual errors, enabling reliable error analysis. The algorithm is made available via PyPI.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a wide range of applications, such as chatbots and code copilots, concerns surrounding the generation of harmful content have come increasingly into focus. Despite significant advances in aligning LLMs with safety and ethical standards, adversarial prompts can still be crafted to elicit undesirable responses. Existing mitigation strategies are predominantly based on post-hoc filtering, which introduces substantial latency or computational overhead, and is incompatible with token-level streaming generation. In this work, we introduce Self-Sanitize, a novel LLM-driven mitigation framework inspired by cognitive psychology, which emulates human self-monitor and self-repair behaviors during conversations. Self-Sanitize comprises a lightweight Self-Monitor module that continuously inspects high-level intentions within the LLM at the token level via representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place correction of harmful content without initiating separate review dialogues. This design allows for real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair, with negligible impact on latency and resource utilization. Given that privacy-invasive content has often been insufficiently focused in previous studies, we perform extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy leakage scenarios. The results demonstrate that Self-Sanitize achieves superior mitigation performance with minimal overhead and without degrading the utility of LLMs, offering a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments.

Abstract: Recent progress, such as DeepSeek-R1, has shown that the GRPO algorithm, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach, can effectively train Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this paper, we analyze three challenges of GRPO: gradient coupling between thoughts and answers, sparse reward signals caused by limited parallel sampling, and unstable advantage estimation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases. Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO. Experiments on math, code, and diverse multimodal tasks demonstrate that GRPO-MA substantially improves performance and training efficiency. Our ablation studies further reveal that increasing the number of answers per thought consistently enhances model performance.

<title>Knowledge Editing with Subspace-Aware Key-Value Mappings</title>

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently correct factual errors in Language Models (LMs). The popular locate-then-edit approach modifies an MLP layer by finding an optimal mapping between its input vector (key) and output vector (value) that leads to the expression of the edited knowledge. However, existing methods without any constraints on the key and value vectors cause significant perturbations to the edited model. To address this, we propose Subspace Knowledge Edit (SUIT), a method that identifies and modifies only the subspace of critical features relevant to the edit. Our empirical results on LLaMA-3-8B, GPT-J-6B, and Qwen2.5-7B models show that SUIT dramatically improves knowledge preservation over strong baselines while maintaining high edit efficacy. This effectiveness confirms that SUIT successfully identifies the critical subspace for the edit. Further analyses provide additional validation for our approach. The source code and data will be released to the public upon publication of the paper.

<title>Building Benchmarks from the Ground Up: Community-Centered Evaluation of LLMs in Healthcare Chatbot Settings</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically evaluated through general or domain-specific benchmarks testing capabilities that often lack grounding in the lived realities of end users. Critical domains such as healthcare require evaluations that extend beyond artificial or simulated tasks to reflect the everyday needs, cultural practices, and nuanced contexts of communities. We propose Samiksha, a community-driven evaluation pipeline co-created with civil-society organizations (CSOs) and community members. Our approach enables scalable, automated benchmarking through a culturally aware, community-driven pipeline in which community feedback informs what to evaluate, how the benchmark is built, and how outputs are scored. We demonstrate this approach in the health domain in India. Our analysis highlights how current multilingual LLMs address nuanced community health queries, while also offering a scalable pathway for contextually grounded and inclusive LLM evaluation.

<title>AdaThink-Med: Medical Adaptive Thinking with Uncertainty-Guided Length Calibration</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question, leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore, enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers, it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions. On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation. Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct reasoning modes, which we characterize as "non-thinking" and "thinking", demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes dynamically.

Abstract: Dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent reading difficulties, is often linked to reduced activity of the visual word form area in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Traditional approaches to studying dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective units within VLMs and demonstrate that targeted ablation of these units, unlike ablation of random units, leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. In particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits without a significant change in orthographic processing. Taken together, our modeling results replicate key characteristics of dyslexia and establish a computational framework for investigating reading disorders.

<title>HiKE: Hierarchical Evaluation Framework for Korean-English Code-Switching Speech Recognition</title>

Abstract: Despite advances in multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR), code-switching (CS), the mixing of languages within an utterance common in daily speech, remains a severely underexplored challenge. In this paper, we introduce HiKE: the Hierarchical Korean-English code-switching benchmark, the first globally accessible evaluation framework for Korean-English CS, aiming to provide a means for the precise evaluation of multilingual ASR models and to foster research in the field. The proposed framework not only consists of high-quality, natural CS data across various topics, but also provides meticulous loanword labels and a hierarchical CS-level labeling scheme (word, phrase, and sentence) that together enable a systematic evaluation of a model's ability to handle each distinct level of code-switching. Through evaluations of diverse multilingual ASR models and fine-tuning experiments, this paper demonstrates that while most multilingual ASR models initially struggle with CS-ASR, this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with CS data. HiKE will be available at https://github.com/ThetaOne-AI/HiKE.

<title>Hype or not? Formalizing Automatic Promotional Language Detection in Biomedical Research</title>

Abstract: In science, promotional language ('hype') is increasing and can undermine objective evaluation of evidence, impede research development, and erode trust in science. In this paper, we introduce the task of automatic detection of hype, which we define as hyperbolic or subjective language that authors use to glamorize, promote, embellish, or exaggerate aspects of their research. We propose formalized guidelines for identifying hype language and apply them to annotate a portion of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant application corpus. We then evaluate traditional text classifiers and language models on this task, comparing their performance with a human baseline. Our experiments show that formalizing annotation guidelines can help humans reliably annotate candidate hype adjectives and that using our annotated dataset to train machine learning models yields promising results. Our findings highlight the linguistic complexity of the task, and the potential need for domain knowledge and temporal awareness of the facts. While some linguistic works address hype detection, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to approach it as a natural language processing task.

<title>InfLLM-V2: Dense-Sparse Switchable Attention for Seamless Short-to-Long Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Long-sequence processing is a critical capability for modern large language models. However, the self-attention mechanism in the standard Transformer architecture faces severe computational and memory bottlenecks when processing long sequences. While trainable sparse attention methods offer a promising solution, existing approaches such as NSA introduce excessive extra parameters and disrupt the conventional \textit{pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long} workflow, resulting in slow convergence and difficulty in acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we introduce dense-sparse switchable attention framework, termed as InfLLM-V2. InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that seamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2 reuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture modification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence processing. Additionally, InfLLM-V2 ensures computational efficiency across all sequence lengths, by using dense attention for short inputs and smoothly transitioning to sparse attention for long sequences. To achieve practical acceleration, we further introduce an efficient implementation of InfLLM-V2 that significantly reduces the computational overhead. Our experiments on long-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that InfLLM-V2 is 4$\times$ faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and 99.7% of the performance, respectively. Based on the InfLLM-V2 framework, we have trained and open-sourced MiniCPM4.1 (https://huggingface.co/openbmb/MiniCPM4.1-8B), a hybrid reasoning model, providing a reproducible implementation for the research community.

<title>Understanding the Dilemma of Unlearning for Large Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24675</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Unlearning seeks to remove specific knowledge from large language models (LLMs), but its effectiveness remains contested. On one side, "forgotten" knowledge can often be recovered through interventions such as light fine-tuning; on the other side, unlearning may induce catastrophic forgetting that degrades general capabilities. Despite active exploration of unlearning methods, interpretability analyses of the mechanism are scarce due to the difficulty of tracing knowledge in LLMs' complex architectures. We address this gap by proposing unPact, an interpretable framework for unlearning via prompt attribution and contribution tracking. Typically, it quantifies each prompt token's influence on outputs, enabling pre- and post-unlearning comparisons to reveal what changes. Across six mainstream unlearning methods, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we find that: (1) Unlearning appears to be effective by disrupting focus on keywords in prompt; (2) Much of the knowledge is not truly erased and can be recovered by simply emphasizing these keywords in prompts, without modifying the model's weights; (3) Catastrophic forgetting arises from indiscriminate penalization of all tokens. Taken together, our results suggest an unlearning dilemma: existing methods tend either to be insufficient - knowledge remains recoverable by keyword emphasis, or overly destructive - general performance collapses due to catastrophic forgetting, still leaving a gap to reliable unlearning.

<title>Reference-Free Rating of LLM Responses via Latent Information</title>

Abstract: How reliable are single-response LLM-as-a-judge ratings without references, and can we obtain fine-grained, deterministic scores in this setting? We study the common practice of asking a judge model to assign Likert-scale scores to free-text responses and show two systematic issues: scores are unstable under sampling and poorly calibrated, leading to compression near the top of the scale and frequent ties. We then propose and evaluate Latent Judges, which derive scalar ratings from internal model signals: (i) probability-weighted scores over integer ratings, (ii) verifier-style probabilities of "yes", and (iii) linear probes trained on model activations at the rating position. Across a broad suite of pairwise and single-rating benchmarks, latent methods match or surpass standard prompting, with consistent gains on pairwise accuracy and listwise ranking relevant to Best-of-N selection. Probability-weighted scores achieve the strongest single-rating correlations, while probes recover useful signals when output logits are miscalibrated. These results indicate that latent information provides deterministic and more discriminative signals for reference-free evaluation, and can improve selection and training approaches like Best-of-$N$, multi-teacher distillation, and routing.

<title>MemGen: Weaving Generative Latent Memory for Self-Evolving Agents</title>

Abstract: Agent memory shapes how Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents, akin to the human brain, progressively refine themselves through environment interactions. Existing paradigms remain constrained: parametric memory forcibly adjusts model parameters, and retrieval-based memory externalizes experience into structured databases, yet neither captures the fluid interweaving of reasoning and memory that underlies human cognition. To address this gap, we propose MemGen, a dynamic generative memory framework that equips agents with a human-esque cognitive faculty. It consists of a \textit{memory trigger}, which monitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, and a \textit{memory weaver}, which takes the agent's current state as stimulus to construct a latent token sequence as machine-native memory to enrich its reasoning. In this way, MemGen enables agents to recall and augment latent memory throughout reasoning, producing a tightly interwoven cycle of memory and cognition. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks show that MemGen surpasses leading external memory systems such as ExpeL and AWM by up to $38.22\%$, exceeds GRPO by up to $13.44\%$, and exhibits strong cross-domain generalization ability. More importantly, we find that without explicit supervision, MemGen spontaneously evolves distinct human-like memory faculties, including planning memory, procedural memory, and working memory, suggesting an emergent trajectory toward more naturalistic forms of machine cognition.

<title>Socratic-Zero : Bootstrapping Reasoning via Data-Free Agent Co-evolution</title>

arXiv:2509.24726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks rely heavily on massive, high-quality datasets-typically human-annotated and thus difficult to scale. While data synthesis or distillation offers a promising alternative, existing methods struggle with inconsistent data quality and an inability to dynamically adapt to the evolving capabilities of the model, leading to suboptimal training signals. To address these limitations, we introduce Socratic-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates high-quality training data from minimal seed examples through the co-evolution of three agents: the Teacher, the Solver, and the Generator. The Solver continuously refines its reasoning by learning from preference feedback on both successful and failed trajectories; the Teacher adaptively crafts increasingly challenging questions based on the Solver's weaknesses; and the Generator distills the Teacher's question-design strategy to enable scalable, high-fidelity curriculum generation. This closed-loop system produces a self-improving curriculum-requiring no pre-existing tasks or labels. Remarkably, starting from only 100 seed questions, our Socratic-Solver-8B achieves an average gain of +20.2 percentage points over prior data synthesis methods across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24-25, Olympiad, MATH-500, Minerva, and GSM8K), with consistent gains on both Qwen3 and GLM4 series models. Even more surprisingly, synthetic data from Socratic-Generator-32B enables student LLMs to achieve superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) commercial LLMs on these benchmarks, including Qwen3-235B-A22B, DeepSeek-V3.1-671B, GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Grok-4, and Claude-4.1-Opus.

Abstract: The quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms limits the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) on long-text tasks. Recently, methods that dynamically estimate block importance have enabled efficient block sparse attention, leading to significant acceleration in long-text pre-filling of LLMs. However, their coarse-grained estimation inevitably leads to performance degradation at high sparsity rates. In this work, we propose ProxyAttn, a training-free sparse attention algorithm that achieves more precise block estimation by compressing the dimension of attention heads. Based on our observation of the similarity among multiple attention heads, we use the scores of pooled representative heads to approximate the scores for all heads. To account for the varying sparsity among heads, we also propose a block-aware dynamic budget estimation method. By combining the scores from representative proxy heads with multi-head dynamic budgets, we achieve a more fine-grained block importance evaluation at low computational cost. Experiments on a variety of mainstream models and extensive benchmarks confirm the underlying similarity among attention heads. Leveraging a fine-grained estimation, the proposed method achieves substantial gains in performance and efficiency compared to existing methods. More precisely, ProxyAttn can achieve up to 10.3x attention acceleration and 2.4x prefilling acceleration without significant performance loss. Our code is available at https://github.com/wyxstriker/ProxyAttn.

Abstract: Test-time Scaling (TTS) has been demonstrated to significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) during the inference phase without altering model parameters. However, existing TTS methods are largely independent, implying that LLMs have not yet evolved to progressively learn how to scale more effectively. With the objective of evolving LLMs to learn ``how to scale test-time computation,'' we propose LatentEvolve, a self-evolving latent TTS framework inspired by the complementary learning system (CLS) theory. Analogous to the human brain's dual system of a fast-recall hippocampus and a slow-consolidating neocortex, LatentEvolve comprises two evolutionary components: \textit{daytime scaling}, which rapidly retrieves historical latent representations to better guide current LLM reasoning; and \textit{nighttime scaling}, which integrates past latent optimizations in a manner akin to the human brain's consolidation of experiences during sleep. The alternation of daytime and nighttime processes facilitates a fast and slow evolution of LLM TTS, mirroring human cognitive dynamics in a fully unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks and five model backbones demonstrate that our LatentEvolve surpasses state-of-the-art TTS methods such as LatentSeek and TTRL by up to $13.33\%$ and exhibits exceptional cross-domain and cross-backbone generalization.

<title>SeaPO: Strategic Error Amplification for Robust Preference Optimization of Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Existing alignment methods for preference optimization of large language models (LLMs) aim to enhance model performance by utilizing pairs of positive and negative samples. However, due to the limited capacity of models in scoring or generating responses, the quality of positive and negative samples may become similar during training, which complicates optimization for preference learning. To address this issue, we introduce SeaPO, a Strategic Error Amplification method that leverages three error types commonly occurring in LLMs to introduce specific error patterns into the model Preference Optimization. This strategy ensures that negative samples are more erroneous than positive samples and preference-based training is employed to mitigate the occurrence of these errors, thereby enhancing model performance. Evaluations across five capability dimensions and different model scales (1.5B to 14B) demonstrate that the generated data significantly improved overall model performance, particularly in terms of truthfulness, with improvements of 5-10 percentage points observed. Further analysis reveals that task performance varies depending on the error types introduced. Injecting the most common error types improves performance in related tasks, while a mix of error types leads to a broader performance enhancement: most tasks show stable improvements, while a few tasks exhibit significant gains.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel, automatic tree-based evaluation metric for LLM-generated step-by-step assembly instructions, that more accurately reflects spatiotemporal aspects of construction than traditional metrics such as BLEU and BERT similarity scores. We apply our proposed metric to the domain of sewing instructions, and show that our metric better correlates with manually-annotated error counts as well as human quality ratings, demonstrating our metric's superiority for evaluating the spatiotemporal soundness of sewing instructions. Further experiments show that our metric is more robust than traditional approaches against artificially-constructed counterfactual examples that are specifically constructed to confound metrics that rely on textual similarity.

<title>KnowGuard: Knowledge-Driven Abstention for Multi-Round Clinical Reasoning</title>

Abstract: In clinical practice, physicians refrain from making decisions when patient information is insufficient. This behavior, known as abstention, is a critical safety mechanism preventing potentially harmful misdiagnoses. Recent investigations have reported the application of large language models (LLMs) in medical scenarios. However, existing LLMs struggle with the abstentions, frequently providing overconfident responses despite incomplete information. This limitation stems from conventional abstention methods relying solely on model self-assessments, which lack systematic strategies to identify knowledge boundaries with external medical evidences. To address this, we propose \textbf{KnowGuard}, a novel \textit{investigate-before-abstain} paradigm that integrates systematic knowledge graph exploration for clinical decision-making. Our approach consists of two key stages operating on a shared contextualized evidence pool: 1) an evidence discovery stage that systematically explores the medical knowledge space through graph expansion and direct retrieval, and 2) an evidence evaluation stage that ranks evidence using multiple factors to adapt exploration based on patient context and conversation history. This two-stage approach enables systematic knowledge graph exploration, allowing models to trace structured reasoning paths and recognize insufficient medical evidence. We evaluate our abstention approach using open-ended multi-round clinical benchmarks that mimic realistic diagnostic scenarios, assessing abstention quality through accuracy-efficiency trade-offs beyond existing closed-form evaluations. Experimental evidences clearly demonstrate that KnowGuard outperforms state-of-the-art abstention approaches, improving diagnostic accuracy by 3.93\% while reducing unnecessary interaction by 7.27 turns on average.

Abstract: While cognitive diagnosis (CD) effectively assesses students' knowledge mastery from structured test data, applying it to real-world teacher-student dialogues presents two fundamental challenges. Traditional CD models lack a suitable framework for handling dynamic, unstructured dialogues, and it's difficult to accurately extract diagnostic semantics from lengthy dialogues. To overcome these hurdles, we propose DiaCDM, an innovative model. We've adapted the initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) framework from educational theory to design a diagnostic framework tailored for dialogue. We also developed a unique graph-based encoding method that integrates teacher questions with relevant knowledge components to capture key information more precisely. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration of cognitive diagnosis in a dialogue setting. Experiments on three real-world dialogue datasets confirm that DiaCDM not only significantly improves diagnostic accuracy but also enhances the results' interpretability, providing teachers with a powerful tool for assessing students' cognitive states. The code is available at https://github.com/Mind-Lab-ECNU/DiaCDM/tree/main.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, the memory footprint of key-value (KV) caches during inference has become a significant bottleneck. Existing approaches primarily focus on compressing KV caches within a single prompt or reusing shared prefixes or frequently ocurred text segments across prompts. However, such strategies are limited in scenarios where prompts are semantically similar but lexically different, which frequently occurs in tasks such as multi-document summarization and conversational agents. We propose \textit{SemShareKV}, a KV cache sharing and compression framework that accelerates LLM inference by reusing KVCache in semantically similar prompts. Instead of relying on exact token matches, SemShareKV applies fuzzy token matching using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to better preserve positional information. By selectively reusing relevant key-value pairs from a reference prompt's cache, SemShareKV reduces redundant computation while maintaining output quality. Experiments on diverse summarization datasets show up to 6.25$\times$ speedup and 42\% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input, with negligible quality degradation. These results highlight the potential of semantic-aware cache sharing for efficient LLM inference.

<title>Hierarchical Error Correction for Large Language Models: A Systematic Framework for Domain-Specific AI Quality Enhancement</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models face significant performance challenges in specialized domains, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 45.9% accuracy on medical coding tasks. This study proposes a Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC) framework that addresses domain-specific AI limitations through systematic error analysis and targeted intervention strategies.
  We analyze error patterns across four specialized domains and find that AI errors follow consistent hierarchical structures: Knowledge-layer errors (58.4%), Reasoning-layer errors (39.6%), and Complexity-layer errors (2.0%). Based on these patterns, we develop a three-stage correction framework that addresses errors according to their hierarchical importance and demonstrates that framework effectiveness correlates inversely with baseline task performance.
  Experimental validation across medical transcription (4,921 cases), legal document classification (1,000 cases), political bias detection (645 cases), and legal reasoning (1,000 cases) shows consistent improvements. Cross-model validation across five LLM architectures demonstrates average improvements of 11.2 percentage points (p < 0.001). However, analysis reveals framework limitations in high-baseline tasks (>75% accuracy), where hierarchical intervention may interfere with effective reasoning processes.
  The results suggest that systematic error analysis can guide effective AI enhancement strategies in specialized domains, particularly for moderate-baseline tasks, while highlighting the importance of understanding framework boundaries for optimal deployment.

Abstract: The widespread use of chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and Llama has fundamentally reshaped how people seek information and advice across domains. Increasingly, these chatbots are being used in high-stakes contexts, including emotional support and mental health concerns. While LLMs can offer scalable support, their ability to safely detect and respond to acute mental health crises remains poorly understood. Progress is hampered by the absence of unified crisis taxonomies, robust annotated benchmarks, and empirical evaluations grounded in clinical best practices. In this work, we address these gaps by introducing a unified taxonomy of six clinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curating a diverse evaluation dataset, and establishing an expert-designed protocol for assessing response appropriateness. We systematically benchmark three state-of-the-art LLMs for their ability to classify crisis types and generate safe, appropriate responses. The results reveal that while LLMs are highly consistent and generally reliable in addressing explicit crisis disclosures, significant risks remain. A non-negligible proportion of responses are rated as inappropriate or harmful, with responses generated by an open-weight model exhibiting higher failure rates than those generated by the commercial ones. We also identify systemic weaknesses in handling indirect or ambiguous risk signals, a reliance on formulaic and inauthentic default replies, and frequent misalignment with user context. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced safeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM deployments. Our taxonomy, datasets, and evaluation framework lay the groundwork for ongoing research and responsible innovation in AI-driven mental health support, helping to minimize harm and better protect vulnerable users.

Abstract: Metaphor is a pervasive feature of discourse and a powerful lens for examining cognition, emotion, and ideology. Large-scale analysis, however, has been constrained by the need for manual annotation due to the context-sensitive nature of metaphor. This study investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in full texts. We compare three methods: (i) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model is provided with a codebook and instructed to annotate texts based on its rules and examples; (ii) prompt engineering, where we design task-specific verbal instructions; and (iii) fine-tuning, where the model is trained on hand-coded texts to optimize performance. Within prompt engineering, we test zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies. Our results show that state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs can achieve high accuracy, with fine-tuning yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. A comparison of human and LLM outputs reveals that most discrepancies are systematic, reflecting well-known grey areas and conceptual challenges in metaphor theory. We propose that LLMs can be used to at least partly automate metaphor identification and can serve as a testbed for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and the theory that underpins them.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationale enables language models to use additional task-related text for problem-solving, benefiting not only from detailed reasoning steps but also from the expanded computational space of longer inputs. Prior work has trained filler or special tokens to serve as additional computation spaces. In this study, we investigate whether language models can leverage artificially inserted sequences of filler tokens solely at inference. We first identify effective token types, numbers, and insertion locations, then examine at what stage of training models begin to exploit the expanded computation space, and finally analyze dynamics within these spaces via attention maps. Experiments on models ranging from 1.7B to 32B across open-domain QA and math tasks show that appropriate token types and counts vary, but placing filler tokens directly before the final 'Answer:' token is most effective. Smaller models benefit most, up to 12.372 percentage points in SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct, indicating that these spaces act as additional computational capacity rather than redundant input. Attention maps reveal that expanded spaces often continue the original attention mechanism and sometimes focus on questions or answer options, suggesting meaningful computation for problem-solving.

Abstract: The ability to summarize long documents succinctly is increasingly important in daily life due to information overload, yet there is a notable lack of such summaries for Spanish documents in general, and in the legal domain in particular. In this work, we present BOE-XSUM, a curated dataset comprising 3,648 concise, plain-language summaries of documents sourced from Spain's ``Bolet\'{\i}n Oficial del Estado'' (BOE), the State Official Gazette. Each entry in the dataset includes a short summary, the original text, and its document type label. We evaluate the performance of medium-sized large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on BOE-XSUM, comparing them to general-purpose generative models in a zero-shot setting. Results show that fine-tuned models significantly outperform their non-specialized counterparts. Notably, the best-performing model -- BERTIN GPT-J 6B (32-bit precision) -- achieves a 24\% performance gain over the top zero-shot model, DeepSeek-R1 (accuracies of 41.6\% vs.\ 33.5\%).

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can generate fluent text, but their ability to replicate the distinctive style of a specific human author remains unclear. We present a fast, training-free framework for authorship verification and style imitation analysis. The method integrates TF-IDF character n-grams with transformer embeddings and classifies text pairs through empirical distance distributions, eliminating the need for supervised training or threshold tuning. It achieves 97.5\% accuracy on academic essays and 94.5\% in cross-domain evaluation, while reducing training time by 91.8\% and memory usage by 59\% relative to parameter-based baselines. Using this framework, we evaluate five LLMs from three separate families (Llama, Qwen, Mixtral) across four prompting strategies - zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot, and text completion. Results show that the prompting strategy has a more substantial influence on style fidelity than model size: few-shot prompting yields up to 23.5x higher style-matching accuracy than zero-shot, and completion prompting reaches 99.9\% agreement with the original author's style. Crucially, high-fidelity imitation does not imply human-like unpredictability - human essays average a perplexity of 29.5, whereas matched LLM outputs average only 15.2. These findings demonstrate that stylistic fidelity and statistical detectability are separable, establishing a reproducible basis for future work in authorship modeling, detection, and identity-conditioned generation.

<title>MobileLLM-R1: Exploring the Limits of Sub-Billion Language Model Reasoners with Open Training Recipes</title>

Abstract: The paradigm shift in large language models (LLMs) from instinctive responses to chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has fueled two prevailing assumptions: (1) reasoning capabilities only emerge in sufficiently large models, and (2) such capabilities require training on massive datasets. While the first assumption has already been challenged by recent sub-billion-parameter reasoning models such as Qwen3-0.6B and DeepSeek distilled variants, the second remains largely unquestioned. In this work, we revisit the necessity of scaling to extremely large corpora (>10T tokens) for reasoning emergence. By carefully curating and resampling open-source datasets that we identify as beneficial under our designed metrics, we demonstrate that strong reasoning abilities can emerge with far less data. Specifically, we show that only ~2T tokens of high-quality data are sufficient, and pre-training with 4.2T tokens on the dataset resampled from these ~2T tokens, followed by a established post-training procedure, enables the development of MobileLLM-R1, a series of sub-billion-parameter reasoning models that substantially outperform prior models trained on fully open-sourced data. For example, MobileLLM-R1-950M achieves an AIME score of 15.5, compared to just 0.6 for OLMo-2-1.48B and 0.3 for SmolLM-2-1.7B. Remarkably, despite being trained on only 11.7% of the tokens compared to Qwen3's proprietary 36T-token corpus for pretraining, MobileLLM-R1-950M matches or surpasses Qwen3-0.6B across multiple reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate further research in this direction, we have released the complete training recipe, data sources, data mixing ratio, and model checkpoints, together with the key insights obtained throughout this study.

Abstract: An effective physician should possess a combination of empathy, expertise, patience, and clear communication when treating a patient. Recent advances have successfully endowed AI doctors with expert diagnostic skills, particularly the ability to actively seek information through inquiry. However, other essential qualities of a good doctor remain overlooked. To bridge this gap, we present MAQuE(Medical Agent Questioning Evaluation), the largest-ever benchmark for the automatic and comprehensive evaluation of medical multi-turn questioning. It features 3,000 realistically simulated patient agents that exhibit diverse linguistic patterns, cognitive limitations, emotional responses, and tendencies for passive disclosure. We also introduce a multi-faceted evaluation framework, covering task success, inquiry proficiency, dialogue competence, inquiry efficiency, and patient experience. Experiments on different LLMs reveal substantial challenges across the evaluation aspects. Even state-of-the-art models show significant room for improvement in their inquiry capabilities. These models are highly sensitive to variations in realistic patient behavior, which considerably impacts diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, our fine-grained metrics expose trade-offs between different evaluation perspectives, highlighting the challenge of balancing performance and practicality in real-world clinical settings.

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) are widely used in e-commerce for personalized suggestions, yet their openness makes them susceptible to shilling attacks, where adversaries inject fake behaviors to manipulate recommendations. Most existing defenses emphasize user-side behaviors while overlooking item-side features such as titles and descriptions that can expose malicious intent. To address this gap, we propose a two-stage detection framework that integrates item-side semantics via large language models (LLMs). The first stage pre-screens suspicious users using low-cost behavioral criteria, and the second stage employs LLM-based auditing to evaluate semantic consistency. Furthermore, we enhance the auditing model through reinforcement fine-tuning on a lightweight LLM with carefully designed reward functions, yielding a specialized detector called SemanticShield. Experiments on six representative attack strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of SemanticShield against shilling attacks, and further evaluation on previously unseen attack methods shows its strong generalization capability. Code is available at https://github.com/FrankenstLee/SemanticShield.

<title>Generalized Correctness Models: Learning Calibrated and Model-Agnostic Correctness Predictors from Historical Patterns</title>

Abstract: Generating accurate and calibrated confidence estimates is critical for deploying LLMs in high-stakes or user-facing applications, and remains an open challenge. Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting a model's "self-knowledge", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its own answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some privileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the model itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict the correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an unrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a "Correctness Model" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical predictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness information, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that GCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns for correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use CMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its generalization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that answer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore alternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that including history as in-context examples can help improve correctness prediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in calibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families and the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective prediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a generalizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding correctness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on self-introspection.

Abstract: Model distillation typically focuses on behavioral mimicry, where a student model is trained to replicate a teacher's output while treating its internal computations as a black box. In this work we propose an alternative approach: Distilling the underlying computational mechanisms implemented by a teacher model. Specifically, we propose circuit distillation, which introduces an objective to align internal representations between analogous circuit components in teacher and student models. We propose a method to match ``functionally correspondent'' circuit components and introduce a loss reflecting similarities between the representations that these induce. We evaluate circuit distillation on entity tracking and theory of mind (ToM) tasks using models from the Llama3 family. Our results demonstrate that circuit distillation outperforms standard distillation, successfully transferring algorithmic capabilities by adjusting only a small, targeted subset of student model parameters. This work establishes the feasibility of transferring mechanisms, which may in turn allow for efficient distillation of targeted teacher capabilities via interpretable and controllable internal student mechanisms.

Abstract: Fast generation of language texts is the holy grail that people pursue in the AI era. In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct (DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation models by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language model (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM counterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical part of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of integral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We also introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly improve the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference performances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated language generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard dLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128 NFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss of about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye. We will release both code and models at github.com/haoyangzheng-ai/didi-instruct.

Abstract: Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) has recently advanced into the multimodal domain, where user-generated content often combines text and images. However, existing multimodal ABSA (MABSA) models struggle to filter noisy visual signals, and effectively align aspects with opinion-bearing content across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose GateMABSA, a novel gated multimodal architecture that integrates syntactic, semantic, and fusion-aware mLSTM. Specifically, GateMABSA introduces three specialized mLSTMs: Syn-mLSTM to incorporate syntactic structure, Sem-mLSTM to emphasize aspect--semantic relevance, and Fuse-mLSTM to perform selective multimodal fusion. Extensive experiments on two benchmark Twitter datasets demonstrate that GateMABSA outperforms several baselines.

Abstract: Despite their capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain opaque with limited understanding of their internal representations. Current interpretability methods, such as direct logit attribution (DLA) and sparse autoencoders (SAEs), provide restricted insight due to limitations such as the model's output vocabulary or unclear feature names. This work introduces Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel paradigm for decoding information from the LLM vector space. It combines ideas from symbolic representations and neural probing to project the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). This probe combines the strengths of SAEs and conventional probes while overcoming their key limitations. We validate our decoding paradigm with controlled input-completion tasks, probing the model's final state before next-token prediction on inputs spanning syntactic pattern recognition, key-value associations, and abstract inference. We further assess it in a question-answering setting, examining the state of the model both before and after text generation. Our experiments show that our probe reliably extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input domains, also helping identify LLM failures. Our work advances information decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extracting more informative, interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.

Abstract: We investigate the use of large language models (LLMs) as post-processing modules for automatic speech recognition (ASR), focusing on their ability to perform error correction for disordered speech. In particular, we propose confidence-informed prompting, where word-level uncertainty estimates are embedded directly into LLM training to improve robustness and generalization across speakers and datasets. This approach directs the model to uncertain ASR regions and reduces overcorrection. We fine-tune a LLaMA 3.1 model and compare our approach to both transcript-only fine-tuning and post hoc confidence-based filtering. Evaluations show that our method achieves a 10% relative WER reduction compared to naive LLM correction on the Speech Accessibility Project spontaneous speech and a 47% reduction on TORGO, demonstrating the effectiveness of confidence-aware fine-tuning for impaired speech.

Abstract: We study Transformers on the task \emph{program trace generation} (PTG), where models produce step-by-step execution traces for synthetic programs. Unlike existing algorithmic problems, PTG externalizes reasoning through long traces where each step is trivial. We train small Transformers with diverse modifications, including alternative position encodings, softmax replacements, hybrid model, and short convolutions. While these models achieve strong in-distribution accuracy, they exhibit systematic failures when generalizing to various factors (e.g., program length, trace steps), though some designs significantly improve generalization.

Abstract: Data-analytic agents are emerging as a key catalyst for automated scientific discovery and for the vision of Innovating AI. Current approaches, however, rely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source models struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and long-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This paper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe designed to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient data resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn rollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a recursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and difficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling strategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically adjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a memory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on DataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning diverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic tasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with an average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming the strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B also performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also incorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the analysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic training for the community. We will release DataMind-12K and DataMind-7B,14B for the community's future research.

Abstract: jina-reranker-v3 is a 0.6B parameter multilingual document reranker that introduces a novel last but not late interaction. Unlike late interaction models such as ColBERT that perform separate encoding followed by multi-vector matching, our approach conducts causal self-attention between query and documents within the same context window, enabling rich cross-document interactions before extracting contextual embeddings from the last token of each document. This compact architecture achieves state-of-the-art BEIR performance with 61.94 nDCG@10 while being ten times smaller than generative listwise rerankers.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance, large language models (LLMs) face challenges in real-world application of lexical simplification (LS), particularly in privacy-sensitive and resource-constrained environments. Moreover, since vulnerable user groups (e.g., people with disabilities) are one of the key target groups of this technology, it is crucial to ensure the safety and correctness of the output of LS systems. To address these issues, we propose an efficient framework for LS systems that utilizes small LLMs deployable in local environments. Within this framework, we explore knowledge distillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines. Our experiments in five languages evaluate model outputs both automatically and manually. Our manual analysis reveals that while knowledge distillation boosts automatic metric scores, it also introduces a safety trade-off by increasing harmful simplifications. Importantly, we find that the model's output probability is a useful signal for detecting harmful simplifications. Leveraging this, we propose a filtering strategy that suppresses harmful simplifications while largely preserving beneficial ones. This work establishes a benchmark for efficient and safe LS with small LLMs. It highlights the key trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and safety, and demonstrates a promising approach for safe real-world deployment.

Abstract: Deep Research Agents (DRAs) can autonomously conduct complex investigations and generate comprehensive reports, demonstrating strong real-world potential. However, existing evaluations mostly rely on close-ended benchmarks, while open-ended deep research benchmarks remain scarce and typically neglect personalized scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Personalized Deep Research Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating personalization in DRAs. It pairs 50 diverse research tasks across 10 domains with 25 authentic user profiles that combine structured persona attributes with dynamic real-world contexts, yielding 250 realistic user-task queries. To assess system performance, we propose the PQR Evaluation Framework, which jointly measures (P) Personalization Alignment, (Q) Content Quality, and (R) Factual Reliability. Our experiments on a range of systems highlight current capabilities and limitations in handling personalized deep research. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for developing and evaluating the next generation of truly personalized AI research assistants.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced web-based Question Answering (QA) systems over semi-structured content, raising questions about the continued utility of knowledge extraction for question answering. This paper investigates the value of triple extraction in this new paradigm by extending an existing benchmark with knowledge extraction annotations and evaluating commercial and open-source LLMs of varying sizes. Our results show that web-scale knowledge extraction remains a challenging task for LLMs. Despite achieving high QA accuracy, LLMs can still benefit from knowledge extraction, through augmentation with extracted triples and multi-task learning. These findings provide insights into the evolving role of knowledge triple extraction in web-based QA and highlight strategies for maximizing LLM effectiveness across different model sizes and resource settings.

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful capabilities for cross-lingual fact-checking. However, these models often exhibit language bias, performing disproportionately better on high-resource languages such as English than on low-resource counterparts. We also present and inspect a novel concept - retrieval bias, when information retrieval systems tend to favor certain information over others, leaving the retrieval process skewed. In this paper, we study language and retrieval bias in the context of Previously Fact-Checked Claim Detection (PFCD). We evaluate six open-source multilingual LLMs across 20 languages using a fully multilingual prompting strategy, leveraging the AMC-16K dataset. By translating task prompts into each language, we uncover disparities in monolingual and cross-lingual performance and identify key trends based on model family, size, and prompting strategy. Our findings highlight persistent bias in LLM behavior and offer recommendations for improving equity in multilingual fact-checking. To investigate retrieval bias, we employed multilingual embedding models and look into the frequency of retrieved claims. Our analysis reveals that certain claims are retrieved disproportionately across different posts, leading to inflated retrieval performance for popular claims while under-representing less common ones.

<title>Paired by the Teacher: Turning Unpaired Data into High-Fidelity Pairs for Low-Resource Text Generation</title>

Abstract: We present Paired by the Teacher (PbT), a two-stage teacher-student pipeline that synthesizes accurate input-output pairs without human labels or parallel data. In many low-resource natural language generation (NLG) scenarios, practitioners may have only raw outputs, like highlights, recaps, or questions, or only raw inputs, such as articles, dialogues, or paragraphs, but seldom both. This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely on costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses this by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise intermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs from IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs, yielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five benchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization (SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired setting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained only on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora and other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated pairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of direct synthesis. Human evaluation on SwitchBoard further confirms that only PbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with the target style, highlighting its advantage of generating in-domain sources that avoid the mismatch, limiting direct synthesis.

<title>Pretraining Large Language Models with NVFP4</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) today are powerful problem solvers across many domains, and they continue to get stronger as they scale in model size, training set size, and training set quality, as shown by extensive research and experimentation across the industry. Training a frontier model today requires on the order of tens to hundreds of yottaflops, which is a massive investment of time, compute, and energy. Improving pretraining efficiency is therefore essential to enable the next generation of even more capable LLMs. While 8-bit floating point (FP8) training is now widely adopted, transitioning to even narrower precision, such as 4-bit floating point (FP4), could unlock additional improvements in computational speed and resource utilization. However, quantization at this level poses challenges to training stability, convergence, and implementation, notably for large-scale models trained on long token horizons.
  In this study, we introduce a novel approach for stable and accurate training of large language models (LLMs) using the NVFP4 format. Our method integrates Random Hadamard transforms (RHT) to bound block-level outliers, employs a two-dimensional quantization scheme for consistent representations across both the forward and backward passes, utilizes stochastic rounding for unbiased gradient estimation, and incorporates selective high-precision layers. We validate our approach by training a 12-billion-parameter model on 10 trillion tokens -- the longest publicly documented training run in 4-bit precision to date. Our results show that the model trained with our NVFP4-based pretraining technique achieves training loss and downstream task accuracies comparable to an FP8 baseline. These findings highlight that NVFP4, when combined with our training approach, represents a major step forward in narrow-precision LLM training algorithms.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) steering has emerged as a promising paradigm for controlling model behavior at inference time through targeted manipulation of hidden states, offering a lightweight alternative to expensive retraining. However, existing steering frameworks suffer from critical limitations: computational inefficiency, limited extensibility, and restricted functionality that hinder both research progress and practical deployment. We present EasySteer, a unified framework for high-performance, extensible LLM steering built on vLLM. Our system features modular architecture with pluggable interfaces for both analysis-based and learning-based methods, fine-grained parameter control, pre-computed steering vectors for eight application domains, and an interactive demonstration system. Through deep integration with vLLM's optimized inference engine, EasySteer achieves 5.5-11.4$\times$ speedup over existing frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in overthinking mitigation, hallucination reduction, and other key applications. EasySteer transforms steering from research technique to production-ready capability, establishing critical infrastructure for deployable, controllable language models.

Abstract: The ability to estimate the quality of scientific papers is central to how both humans and AI systems will advance scientific knowledge in the future. However, existing LLM-based estimation methods suffer from high inference cost, whereas the faster direct score regression approach is limited by scale inconsistencies. We present NAIPv2, a debiased and efficient framework for paper quality estimation. NAIPv2 employs pairwise learning within domain-year groups to reduce inconsistencies in reviewer ratings and introduces the Review Tendency Signal (RTS) as a probabilistic integration of reviewer scores and confidences. To support training and evaluation, we further construct NAIDv2, a large-scale dataset of 24,276 ICLR submissions enriched with metadata and detailed structured content. Trained on pairwise comparisons but enabling efficient pointwise prediction at deployment, NAIPv2 achieves state-of-the-art performance (78.2% AUC, 0.432 Spearman), while maintaining scalable, linear-time efficiency at inference. Notably, on unseen NeurIPS submissions, it further demonstrates strong generalization, with predicted scores increasing consistently across decision categories from Rejected to Oral. These findings establish NAIPv2 as a debiased and scalable framework for automated paper quality estimation, marking a step toward future scientific intelligence systems. Code and dataset are released at https://sway.cloud.microsoft/Pr42npP80MfPhvj8.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in modern search and answer systems to synthesize multiple, sometimes conflicting, texts into a single response, yet current pipelines offer weak incentives for sources to be accurate and are vulnerable to adversarial content. We introduce Truthful Text Summarization (TTS), an incentive-aligned framework that improves factual robustness without ground-truth labels. TTS (i) decomposes a draft synthesis into atomic claims, (ii) elicits each source's stance on every claim, (iii) scores sources with an adapted multi-task peer-prediction mechanism that rewards informative agreement, and (iv) filters unreliable sources before re-summarizing. We establish formal guarantees that align a source's incentives with informative honesty, making truthful reporting the utility-maximizing strategy. Experiments show that TTS improves factual accuracy and robustness while preserving fluency, aligning exposure with informative corroboration and disincentivizing manipulation.

<title>Learning to Parallel: Accelerating Diffusion Large Language Models via Adaptive Parallel Decoding</title>

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires $\mathcal{O}(n)$ sequential steps for $n$ tokens, fundamentally limiting inference throughput. Recent diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) enable parallel token generation through iterative denoising. However, current parallel decoding strategies rely on fixed, input-agnostic heuristics (e.g., confidence thresholds), which fail to adapt to input-specific characteristics, resulting in suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across diverse NLP tasks. In this work, we explore a more flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding. We propose Learning to Parallel Decode (Learn2PD), a framework that trains a lightweight and adaptive filter model to predict, for each token position, whether the current prediction matches the final output. This learned filter approximates an oracle parallel decoding strategy that unmasks tokens only when correctly predicted. Importantly, the filter model is learned in a post-training manner, requiring only a small amount of computation to optimize it (minute-level GPU time). Additionally, we introduce End-of-Text Prediction (EoTP) to detect decoding completion at the end of sequence, avoiding redundant decoding of padding tokens. Experiments on the LLaDA benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves up to 22.58$\times$ speedup without any performance drop, and up to 57.51$\times$ when combined with KV-Cache.

Abstract: Building Large Language Model agents that expand their capabilities by interacting with external tools represents a new frontier in AI research and applications. In this paper, we introduce InfoAgent, a deep research agent powered by an innovative data synthesis pipeline and orchestrated web search tools. To construct challenging, hard-to-find queries,we build entity trees and apply sub-tree sampling with entity fuzzification to systematically increase question difficulty. Unlike prior work that relies heavily on commercial search tools, we develop a dedicated self-hosted search infrastructure, enhancing transparency of agent environments and facilitating further advancement of agent capacity. We evaluate the effectiveness of our data pipeline by measuring the average number of tool calls required to correctly answer a question, and also show that our agent yields better performance when equipped with our tools. Our \mbox{InfoAgent} is post-trained from Qwen3-14B using a two-stage recipe: cold-start supervised finetuning to instill long-horizon search behaviors, followed by reinforcement learning which significantly improves reasoning-driven tool use. With our methods, InfoAgent achieves 15.3\% accuracy on BrowseComp, 29.2\% on BrowseComp-ZH, and 40.4\% on Xbench-DS, outperforming prior open-source deep research agents such as WebSailor-72B and DeepDive-32B.

<title>CAOTE: KV Cache Selection for LLMs via Attention Output Error-Based Token Eviction</title>

Abstract: While long context support of large language models has extended their abilities, it also incurs challenges in memory and compute which becomes crucial bottlenecks in resource-restricted devices. Token eviction, a widely adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors. This is the first method which uses value tokens on top of attention-based eviction scores in closed-form. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.

<title>Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models:Toward Joint Visualization of Interactive and Independent Effects</title>

Abstract: Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless, CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process. Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of predictive performance.

<title>Benefits and Pitfalls of Reinforcement Learning for Language Model Planning: A Theoretical Perspective</title>

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction, focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in practice.

Abstract: Dialect speech embodies rich cultural and linguistic diversity, yet building text-to-speech (TTS) systems for dialects remains challenging due to scarce data, inconsistent orthographies, and complex phonetic variation. To address these issues, we present DiaMoE-TTS, a unified IPA-based framework that standardizes phonetic representations and resolves grapheme-to-phoneme ambiguities. Built upon the F5-TTS architecture, the system introduces a dialect-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to model phonological differences and employs parameter-efficient adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptors (LoRA) and Conditioning Adapters for rapid transfer to new dialects. Unlike approaches dependent on large-scale or proprietary resources, DiaMoE-TTS enables scalable, open-data-driven synthesis. Experiments demonstrate natural and expressive speech generation, achieving zero-shot performance on unseen dialects and specialized domains such as Peking Opera with only a few hours of data.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality, semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168 human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc), while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for Best-of-N sampling.

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M, 70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses, or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy, particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and one favoring generative performance.

Abstract: Proteomics data is essential to pathogenic understanding of a disease phenotype. In cancer, analysis of molecular signatures enables precision medicine through the identification of biological processes that drive individualized tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and clinical heterogeneity. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capacity to integrate and reason across heterogeneous data modalities. However, performing multi-modal language modeling for molecular understanding of patient-specific proteomics remains a significant challenge due to two barriers: (1) the lack of instruction-tuning datasets that enable clinical interpretation from proteomics data, and (2) the absence of language modeling architectures designed to capture the rich heterogeneity of molecular data. In this work, we introduce CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT, the first instruction tuning dataset for molecular understanding of oncology, comprising over 400k open-ended examples derived from individualized proteomic profiles curated from the largest national proteomics cancer study (CPTAC). Additionally, we propose KRONOS (Knowledge Representation of patient Omics Networks in Oncology via Structured tuning), a novel graph-LLM framework that leverages molecular interaction topology with proteomics to learn patient-specific graph representations for enhanced clinical reasoning. We show that KRONOS achieves competitive performance across benchmark clinical tasks, including molecular classification, temporal trajectory modeling, and tumor stage prediction from proteomics data. Ultimately, this approach empowers LLMs to understand patient-level pathogenesis, advancing precision medicine through more accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment stratification.

<title>JE-IRT: A Geometric Lens on LLM Abilities through Joint Embedding Item Response Theory</title>

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT, a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework, our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization: once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding. The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and generalization.

<title>Not only a helper, but also a teacher: Interactive LLM Cascade</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries. Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning. Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models (by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

<title>Tracing the Representation Geometry of Language Models from Pretraining to Post-training</title>

Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay ($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase, where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness. Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but reducing generation diversity.

<title>Virus Infection Attack on LLMs: Your Poisoning Can Spread "VIA" Synthetic Data</title>

Abstract: Synthetic data refers to artificial samples generated by models. While it has been validated to significantly enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) during training and has been widely adopted in LLM development, potential security risks it may introduce remain uninvestigated. This paper systematically evaluates the resilience of synthetic-data-integrated training paradigm for LLMs against mainstream poisoning and backdoor attacks. We reveal that such a paradigm exhibits strong resistance to existing attacks, primarily thanks to the different distribution patterns between poisoning data and queries used to generate synthetic samples. To enhance the effectiveness of these attacks and further investigate the security risks introduced by synthetic data, we introduce a novel and universal attack framework, namely, Virus Infection Attack (VIA), which enables the propagation of current attacks through synthetic data even under purely clean queries. Inspired by the principles of virus design in cybersecurity, VIA conceals the poisoning payload within a protective "shell" and strategically searches for optimal hijacking points in benign samples to maximize the likelihood of generating malicious content. Extensive experiments on both data poisoning and backdoor attacks show that VIA significantly increases the presence of poisoning content in synthetic data and correspondingly raises the attack success rate (ASR) on downstream models to levels comparable to those observed in the poisoned upstream models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering (SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors, including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\% on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to 48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and light counterfactual edits.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences. To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an $n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks, achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex, non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at https://github.com/smiles724/MNPO.

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility), a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies, thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost. We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a 5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/he-h/rhythm.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle, we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at https://github.com/HaotianLiu123/CCGSPG.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization, objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations. We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500, OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large reasoning models.

<title>$p$-less Sampling: A Robust Hyperparameter-Free Approach for LLM Decoding</title>

arXiv:2509.23234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods, $p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on $p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies, and diversity assessments.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation, and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMS) have shown increasing effectiveness in Text-to-SQL tasks. However, another closely related problem, Cross-System SQL Translation (a.k.a., SQL-to-SQL), which adapts a query written for one database system (e.g., MySQL) into its equivalent one for another system (e.g., ClickHouse), is of great practical importance but remains underexplored. Existing SQL benchmarks are not well-suited for SQL-to-SQL evaluation, which (1) focus on a limited set of database systems (often just SQLite) and (2) cannot capture many system-specific SQL dialects (e.g., customized functions, data types, and syntax rules). Thus, in this paper, we introduce PARROT, a Practical And Realistic BenchmaRk for CrOss-System SQL Translation. PARROT comprises 598 translation pairs from 38 open-source benchmarks and real-world business services, specifically prepared to challenge system-specific SQL understanding (e.g., LLMS achieve lower than 38.53% accuracy on average). We also provide multiple benchmark variants, including PARROT-Diverse with 28,003 translations (for extensive syntax testing) and PARROT-Simple with 5,306 representative samples (for focused stress testing), covering 22 production-grade database systems. To promote future research, we release a public leaderboard and source code at: https://code4db.github.io/parrot-bench/.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6% accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark. Our code is available in the GitHub.

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable, surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream, identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs. SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can revise their understanding in response to new information.

<title>FoR-SALE: Frame of Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing</title>

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image (T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE), an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3% using only a single round of correction.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on tasks that require reasoning, such as text-to-SQL, code generation, and debugging. However, regulatory frameworks with strict privacy requirements constrain their integration into sensitive systems. State-of-the-art LLMs are also proprietary, costly, and resource-intensive, making local deployment impractical. Consequently, utilizing such LLMs often requires sharing data with third-party providers, raising privacy concerns and risking noncompliance with regulations. Although fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) can outperform LLMs on certain tasks and be deployed locally to mitigate privacy concerns, they underperform on more complex tasks such as text-to-SQL translation. In this work, we introduce MaskSQL, a text-to-SQL framework that utilizes abstraction as a privacy protection mechanism to mask sensitive information in LLM prompts. Unlike redaction, which removes content entirely, or generalization, which broadens tokens, abstraction retains essential information while discarding unnecessary details, striking an effective privacy-utility balance for the text-to-SQL task. Moreover, by providing mechanisms to control the privacy-utility tradeoff, MaskSQL facilitates adoption across a broader range of use cases. Our experimental results show that MaskSQL outperforms leading SLM-based text-to-SQL models and achieves performance approaching state-of-the-art LLM-based models, while preserving privacy.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data. In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters (\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when evaluating claims of such generalization.

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora, where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure, becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap. Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following, and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain. Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition, and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision, question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark design and evaluation.

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent, which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research: https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/PrefCleanBench.

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training, where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and remask them. This alternating ($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$) process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

<title>From Past To Path: Masked History Learning for Next-Item Prediction in Generative Recommendation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23649</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Generative recommendation, which directly generates item identifiers, has emerged as a promising paradigm for recommendation systems. However, its potential is fundamentally constrained by the reliance on purely autoregressive training. This approach focuses solely on predicting the next item while ignoring the rich internal structure of a user's interaction history, thus failing to grasp the underlying intent. To address this limitation, we propose Masked History Learning (MHL), a novel training framework that shifts the objective from simple next-step prediction to deep comprehension of history. MHL augments the standard autoregressive objective with an auxiliary task of reconstructing masked historical items, compelling the model to understand ``why'' an item path is formed from the user's past behaviors, rather than just ``what'' item comes next. We introduce two key contributions to enhance this framework: (1) an entropy-guided masking policy that intelligently targets the most informative historical items for reconstruction, and (2) a curriculum learning scheduler that progressively transitions from history reconstruction to future prediction. Experiments on three public datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, highlighting that a comprehensive understanding of the past is crucial for accurately predicting a user's future path. The code will be released to the public.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on vision-language benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether these benchmarks assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues. Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction, hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases, indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers & practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases, enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains. Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers, confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at \href{https://aka.ms/R2A-code}{this URL}.

<title>Towards a Comprehensive Scaling Law of Mixture-of-Experts</title>

arXiv:2509.23678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size ($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)). Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model design and training.

<title>HomeSafeBench: A Benchmark for Embodied Vision-Language Models in Free-Exploration Home Safety Inspection</title>

Abstract: Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards: fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room, HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs. The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable reference and support for future research related to home security inspections. Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work, we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds, covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover, our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices, such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases are publicly available: https://github.com/jianshuod/SafeSearch.

Abstract: Game theory has grown into a major field over the past few decades, and poker has long served as one of its key case studies. Game-Theory-Optimal (GTO) provides strategies to avoid loss in poker, but pure GTO does not guarantee maximum profit. To this end, we aim to develop a model that outperforms GTO strategies to maximize profit in No Limit Holdem, in heads-up (two-player) and multi-way (more than two-player) situations. Our model finds the GTO foundation and goes further to exploit opponents. The model first navigates toward many simulated poker hands against itself and keeps adjusting its decisions until no action can reliably beat it, creating a strong baseline that is close to the theoretical best strategy. Then, it adapts by observing opponent behavior and adjusting its strategy to capture extra value accordingly. Our results indicate that Monte-Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) performs best in heads-up situations and CFR remains the strongest method in most multi-way situations. By combining the defensive strength of GTO with real-time exploitation, our approach aims to show how poker agents can move from merely not losing to consistently winning against diverse opponents.

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

<title>From What to Why: A Multi-Agent System for Evidence-based Chemical Reaction Condition Reasoning</title>

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions, limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable, human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI in scientific discovery.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering.

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV) and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method, Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off, VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to 21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods, effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for continuous LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising direction, offering efficiency and scalability by activating only a subset of parameters during inference. However, current research remains largely performance-centric, with limited understanding of its internal mechanisms, thereby constraining broader progress. In this work, we use an internal metric to investigate the mechanisms of MoE architecture by explicitly incorporating routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors. Through systematic analyses of a wide range of publicly available MoE models, we uncover several findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, reflecting stronger generalization; (2) training exhibits a dynamic trajectory, where benchmark performance alone provides limited signal while MUI reveals deeper insights; (3) task completion emerges from collaborative contributions of multiple experts, with shared experts driving concentration; and (4) activation patterns at the neuron level provide a fine-grained proxy for data diversity. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of MUI as a complementary indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into the capacity, dynamics, and specialization of MoE models.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency, limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches 58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods (e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating planning from execution. The code and pre-trained models for the project are available at: https://github.com/yks23/Explore-Execute-Chain.git

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length, have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

<title>Detecting and Rectifying Noisy Labels: A Similarity-based Approach</title>

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could damage the performance of neural net training. As the size of modern deep networks grows, there is a growing demand for automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc, model-agnostic error detection and rectification methods utilizing the penultimate feature from a neural network. Our idea is based on the observation that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Extensive experiments show our method not only demonstrates high performance across various noises but also automatically rectifies these errors to improve the quality of datasets.

Abstract: The advent of transformers has in recent years led to powerful and revolutionary Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this, our understanding on the capability of transformers is still meager. In this invited contribution, we recount the rapid progress in the last few years to the question of what transformers can do. In particular, we will see the integral role of logic and automata (also with some help from circuit complexity) in answering this question. We also mention several open problems at the intersection of logic, automata, verification and transformers.

<title>Do Repetitions Matter? Strengthening Reliability in LLM Evaluations</title>

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression, domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world reliability.

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs) presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$ and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10 \times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential for general-purpose GUI grounding.

<title>Reasoning or Retrieval? A Study of Answer Attribution on Large Reasoning Models</title>

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors: problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

<title>Group-Relative REINFORCE Is Secretly an Off-Policy Algorithm: Demystifying Some Myths About GRPO and Its Friends</title>

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss, and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is available at https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/rec_gsm8k.

<title>Metamorphic Testing for Audio Content Moderation Software</title>

Abstract: The rapid growth of audio-centric platforms and applications such as WhatsApp and Twitter has transformed the way people communicate and share audio content in modern society. However, these platforms are increasingly misused to disseminate harmful audio content, such as hate speech, deceptive advertisements, and explicit material, which can have significant negative consequences (e.g., detrimental effects on mental health). In response, researchers and practitioners have been actively developing and deploying audio content moderation tools to tackle this issue. Despite these efforts, malicious actors can bypass moderation systems by making subtle alterations to audio content, such as modifying pitch or inserting noise. Moreover, the effectiveness of modern audio moderation tools against such adversarial inputs remains insufficiently studied. To address these challenges, we propose MTAM, a Metamorphic Testing framework for Audio content Moderation software. Specifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2000 audio clips and define 14 metamorphic relations across two perturbation categories: Audio Features-Based and Heuristic perturbations. MTAM applies these metamorphic relations to toxic audio content to generate test cases that remain harmful while being more likely to evade detection. In our evaluation, we employ MTAM to test five commercial textual content moderation software and an academic model against three kinds of toxic content. The results show that MTAM achieves up to 38.6%, 18.3%, 35.1%, 16.7%, and 51.1% error finding rates (EFR) when testing commercial moderation software provided by Gladia, Assembly AI, Baidu, Nextdata, and Tencent, respectively, and it obtains up to 45.7% EFR when testing the state-of-the-art algorithms from the academy.

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning, yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph, backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth, achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem difficulty.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models (LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy. However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements, reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of hidden states for efficient reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained: reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code base and model weights will be released later.

Abstract: We examine how textual features in earnings press releases predict stock returns on earnings announcement days. Using over 138,000 press releases from 2005 to 2023, we compare traditional bag-of-words and BERT-based embeddings. We find that press release content (soft information) is as informative as earnings surprise (hard information), with FinBERT yielding the highest predictive power. Combining models enhances explanatory strength and interpretability of the content of press releases. Stock prices fully reflect the content of press releases at market open. If press releases are leaked, it offers predictive advantage. Topic analysis reveals self-serving bias in managerial narratives. Our framework supports real-time return prediction through the integration of online learning, provides interpretability and reveals the nuanced role of language in price formation.

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However, traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a novel approach for Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic AI. Built on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, PAME-AI offers a structured framework to move from raw data to actionable insights for high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental data into actionable message design strategies. We demonstrate our approach's effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient encounters in Stage 1 and 74,908 in Stage 2. The best-performing generated message achieved 68.76% engagement compared to the 61.27% baseline, representing a 12.2\% relative improvement in click-through rates. This agentic architecture enables parallel processing, hypothesis validation, and continuous learning, making it particularly suitable for large-scale healthcare communication optimization.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

Abstract: We present an overview of the SCIDOCA 2025 Shared Task, which focuses on citation discovery and prediction in scientific documents. The task is divided into three subtasks: (1) Citation Discovery, where systems must identify relevant references for a given paragraph; (2) Masked Citation Prediction, which requires selecting the correct citation for masked citation slots; and (3) Citation Sentence Prediction, where systems must determine the correct reference for each cited sentence. We release a large-scale dataset constructed from the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus (S2ORC), containing over 60,000 annotated paragraphs and a curated reference set. The test set consists of 1,000 paragraphs from distinct papers, each annotated with ground-truth citations and distractor candidates. A total of seven teams registered, with three submitting results. We report performance metrics across all subtasks and analyze the effectiveness of submitted systems. This shared task provides a new benchmark for evaluating citation modeling and encourages future research in scientific document understanding.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations: (a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b) heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training, SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together, SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

<title>Bridging the behavior-neural gap: A multimodal AI reveals the brain's geometry of emotion more accurately than human self-reports</title>

Abstract: The ability to represent emotion plays a significant role in human cognition and social interaction, yet the high-dimensional geometry of this affective space and its neural underpinnings remain debated. A key challenge, the `behavior-neural gap,' is the limited ability of human self-reports to predict brain activity. Here we test the hypothesis that this gap arises from the constraints of traditional rating scales and that large-scale similarity judgments can more faithfully capture the brain's affective geometry. Using AI models as `cognitive agents,' we collected millions of triplet odd-one-out judgments from a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and a language-only model (LLM) in response to 2,180 emotionally evocative videos. We found that the emergent 30-dimensional embeddings from these models are highly interpretable and organize emotion primarily along categorical lines, yet in a blended fashion that incorporates dimensional properties. Most remarkably, the MLLM's representation predicted neural activity in human emotion-processing networks with the highest accuracy, outperforming not only the LLM but also, counterintuitively, representations derived directly from human behavioral ratings. This result supports our primary hypothesis and suggests that sensory grounding--learning from rich visual data--is critical for developing a truly neurally-aligned conceptual framework for emotion. Our findings provide compelling evidence that MLLMs can autonomously develop rich, neurally-aligned affective representations, offering a powerful paradigm to bridge the gap between subjective experience and its neural substrates.

Abstract: The past two years have witnessed the meteoric rise of Large Language Model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS), which harness collective intelligence and exhibit a remarkable trajectory toward self-evolution. This paradigm has rapidly progressed from manually engineered systems that require bespoke configuration of prompts, tools, roles, and communication protocols toward frameworks capable of automated orchestration. Yet, dominant automatic multi-agent systems, whether generated by external modules or a single LLM agent, largely adhere to a rigid ``\textit{generate-once-and-deploy}'' paradigm, rendering the resulting systems brittle and ill-prepared for the dynamism and uncertainty of real-world environments. To transcend this limitation, we introduce MAS$^2$, a paradigm predicated on the principle of recursive self-generation: a multi-agent system that autonomously architects bespoke multi-agent systems for diverse problems. Technically, we devise a ``\textit{generator-implementer-rectifier}'' tri-agent team capable of dynamically composing and adaptively rectifying a target agent system in response to real-time task demands. Collaborative Tree Optimization is proposed to train and specialize these meta-agents. Extensive evaluation across seven benchmarks reveals that MAS$^2$ achieves performance gains of up to $19.6\%$ over state-of-the-art MAS in complex scenarios such as deep research and code generation. Moreover, MAS$^2$ exhibits superior cross-backbone generalization, effectively leveraging previously unseen LLMs to yield improvements of up to $15.1\%$. Crucially, these gains are attained without incurring excessive token costs, as MAS$^2$ consistently resides on the Pareto frontier of cost-performance trade-offs.

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution. However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a practical path to safer LRMs.

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR (+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over 2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate, efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family, inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them, RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.

<title>Experience-guided reflective co-evolution of prompts and heuristics for automatic algorithm design</title>

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models (LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics (EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

<title>LEAF: A Robust Expert-Based Framework for Few-Shot Continual Event Detection</title>

Abstract: Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) poses the dual challenges of learning from limited data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting across sequential tasks. Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due to the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge interference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation strategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To address these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based framework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection mechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling expert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve generalization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive learning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level semantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on the memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that transfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models (VideoLLMs) call for new evaluation protocols and benchmarks for complex temporal reasoning in video-language understanding. Inspired by the needle in a haystack test widely used by LLMs, we introduce a novel task of Needle in a Montage (NeMo), designed to assess VideoLLMs' critical reasoning capabilities, including long-context recall and temporal grounding. To generate video question answering data for our task, we develop a scalable automated data generation pipeline that facilitates high-quality data synthesis. Built upon the proposed pipeline, we present NeMoBench, a video-language benchmark centered on our task. Specifically, our full set of NeMoBench features 31,378 automatically generated question-answer (QA) pairs from 13,486 videos with various durations ranging from seconds to hours. Experiments demonstrate that our pipeline can reliably and automatically generate high-quality evaluation data, enabling NeMoBench to be continuously updated with the latest videos. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art models on our benchmark, providing extensive results and key insights into their capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment faces a critical dilemma when addressing multiple human preferences: improvements in one dimension frequently come at the expense of others, creating unavoidable trade-offs between competing objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. While prior work mainly focuses on constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to mitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of resolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present OrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging orthogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically non-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical guarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal subspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable convergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that: I. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from 34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless, and truthful dimensions. II. With an average overall reward improvement of 13.96%.

<title>On the Self-awareness of Large Reasoning Models' Capability Boundaries</title>

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

<title>VSSFlow: Unifying Video-conditioned Sound and Speech Generation via Joint Learning</title>

Abstract: Video-conditioned sound and speech generation, encompassing video-to-sound (V2S) and visual text-to-speech (VisualTTS) tasks, are conventionally addressed as separate tasks, with limited exploration to unify them within a signle framework. Recent attempts to unify V2S and VisualTTS face challenges in handling distinct condition types (e.g., heterogeneous video and transcript conditions) and require complex training stages. Unifying these two tasks remains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which seamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching framework. VSSFlow uses a novel condition aggregation mechanism to handle distinct input signals. We find that cross-attention and self-attention layer exhibit different inductive biases in the process of introducing condition. Therefore, VSSFlow leverages these inductive biases to effectively handle different representations: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and self-attention for more deterministic speech transcripts. Furthermore, contrary to the prevailing belief that joint training on the two tasks requires complex training strategies and may degrade performance, we find that VSSFlow benefits from the end-to-end joint learning process for sound and speech generation without extra designs on training stages. Detailed analysis attributes it to the learned general audio prior shared between tasks, which accelerates convergence, enhances conditional generation, and stabilizes the classifier-free guidance process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VSSFlow surpasses the state-of-the-art domain-specific baselines on both V2S and VisualTTS benchmarks, underscoring the critical potential of unified generative models.

<title>Pushing LLMs to Their Logical Reasoning Bound: The Role of Data Reasoning Intensity</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However, most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential.

Abstract: With the growing popularity of LLM agents and RAG, it has become increasingly important to retrieve documents that are essential for solving a task, even when their connection to the task is indirect or implicit. Addressing this problem requires fine-grained reasoning to accurately assess the relevance between the task and each candidate document. This capability, however, poses a significant challenge for existing IR techniques. Despite recent progress in reasoning-enhanced IR, existing approaches still face significant challenges in applicability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose Retro*, a novel approach for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our method introduces a rubric-based relevance scoring mechanism, enabling the model to reason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly defined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance score. Retro* also supports test-time scaling by combining multiple reasoning trajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance estimates. To optimize Retro*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism, which employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each training sample. Our experiments show that Retro* outperforms existing document retrieval methods with notable advantages, leading to state-of-the-art performance on the BRIGHT benchmark.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI, and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality control in dynamic medical settings.

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire (PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have significant implications for psychometrics and social science research, providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents, they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance, and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models, prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust exploratory behavior.

<title>DiffTester: Accelerating Unit Test Generation for Diffusion LLMs via Repetitive Pattern</title>

Abstract: Software development relies heavily on extensive unit testing, which makes the efficiency of automated Unit Test Generation (UTG) particularly important. However, most existing LLMs generate test cases one token at a time in each forward pass, which leads to inefficient UTG. Recently, diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have emerged, offering promising parallel generation capabilities and showing strong potential for efficient UTG. Despite this advantage, their application to UTG is still constrained by a clear trade-off between efficiency and test quality, since increasing the number of tokens generated in each step often causes a sharp decline in the quality of test cases. To overcome this limitation, we present DiffTester, an acceleration framework specifically tailored for dLLMs in UTG. The key idea of DiffTester is that unit tests targeting the same focal method often share repetitive structural patterns. By dynamically identifying these common patterns through abstract syntax tree analysis during generation, DiffTester adaptively increases the number of tokens produced at each step without compromising the quality of the output. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we extend the original TestEval benchmark, which was limited to Python, by introducing additional programming languages including Java and C++. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with two representative models show that DiffTester delivers significant acceleration while preserving test coverage. Moreover, DiffTester generalizes well across different dLLMs and programming languages, providing a practical and scalable solution for efficient UTG in software development. Code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/wellbeingyang/DLM4UTG-open .

<title>Learning from Convenience Samples: A Case Study on Fine-Tuning LLMs for Survey Non-response in the German Longitudinal Election Study</title>

Abstract: Survey researchers face two key challenges: the rising costs of probability samples and missing data (e.g., non-response or attrition), which can undermine inference and increase the use of convenience samples. Recent work explores using large language models (LLMs) to simulate respondents via persona-based prompts, often without labeled data. We study a more practical setting where partial survey responses exist: we fine-tune LLMs on available data to impute self-reported vote choice under both random and systematic nonresponse, using the German Longitudinal Election Study. We compare zero-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning against tabular classifiers (e.g., CatBoost) and test how different convenience samples (e.g., students) used for fine-tuning affect generalization.
  Our results show that when data are missing completely at random, fine-tuned LLMs match tabular classifiers but outperform zero-shot approaches. When only biased convenience samples are available, fine-tuning small (3B to 8B) open-source LLMs can recover both individual-level predictions and population-level distributions more accurately than zero-shot and often better than tabular methods. This suggests fine-tuned LLMs offer a promising strategy for researchers working with non-probability samples or systematic missingness, and may enable new survey designs requiring only easily accessible subpopulations.

<title>Scaling with Collapse: Efficient and Predictable Training of LLM Families</title>

Abstract: Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities -- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*, where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget, in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.

Experiments on five datasets and multiple student models show consistent improvements over conventional black-box KD baselines.

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies. This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation. Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target, requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills, then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex problems.

Abstract: We present MGM-Omni, a unified Omni LLM for omni-modal understanding and expressive, long-horizon speech generation. Unlike cascaded pipelines that isolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a "brain-mouth" design with a dual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal reasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient cross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For understanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder design enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions. For generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech token-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice cloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent work, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing open source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences, producing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form audio and omnimodal understanding. MGM-Omni establishes an efficient, end-to-end paradigm for omnimodal understanding and controllable, personalised long-horizon speech generation.

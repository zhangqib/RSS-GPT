Abstract: Cardiac action potential models allow examination of a variety of cardiac dynamics, including how behavior may change under specific interventions. To study a specific scenario, including patient-specific cases, model parameter sets must be found that accurately reproduce the dynamics of interest. To facilitate this complex and time-consuming process, we present an interactive browser-based tool that uses the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm implemented in JavaScript and taking advantage of the WebGL API for hardware acceleration. Our tool allows rapid customization and can find low-error fittings to user-provided voltage time series or action potential duration data from multiple cycle lengths in a few iterations (10-32), corresponding to a runtime of a few seconds on most machines. Additionally, our tool focuses on ease of use and flexibility, providing a webpage interface that allows users to select a subset of parameters to fit, set the range of values each parameter is allowed to assume, and control the PSO algorithm hyperparameters. We demonstrate our tool's utility by fitting a variety of models to different datasets, showing how convergence is affected by model choice, dataset properties, and PSO algorithmic settings, and explaining new insights gained about the physiological and dynamical roles of the model parameters.

<div> Keywords: Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis, Financial Predictions

Summary:
Blockchain technology is not only used for financial transactions but also for storing and sharing non-financial content. This hidden content can impact cryptocurrency price movements by conveying private information and shaping public sentiment. Current methods of analyzing blockchain data are limited, prompting the use of Natural Language Processing techniques to extract sentiment from transactional data. The study demonstrates the predictive power of blockchain-embedded sentiment in forecasting cryptocurrency prices on Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. It uncovers an informational advantage for Bitcoin over Ethereum, showing that sentiment analysis can effectively predict price movements. This research highlights the value of blockchain sentiment analysis in enhancing financial predictions within cryptocurrency markets, providing a novel framework for leveraging freely available, transparent, and immutable data for informed decision-making in the digital asset space.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency blockchains, beyond their primary role as distributed payment systems, are increasingly used to store and share arbitrary content, such as text messages and files. Although often non-financial, this hidden content can impact price movements by conveying private information, shaping sentiment, and influencing public opinion. However, current analyses of such data are limited in scope and scalability, primarily relying on manual classification or hand-crafted heuristics. In this work, we address these limitations by employing Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze, detect patterns, and extract public sentiment encoded within blockchain transactional data. Using a variety of Machine Learning techniques, we showcase for the first time the predictive power of blockchain-embedded sentiment in forecasting cryptocurrency price movements on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Our findings shed light on a previously underexplored source of freely available, transparent, and immutable data and introduce blockchain sentiment analysis as a novel and robust framework for enhancing financial predictions in cryptocurrency markets. Incidentally, we discover an asymmetry between cryptocurrencies; Bitcoin has an informational advantage over Ethereum in that the sentiment embedded into transactional data is sufficient to predict its price movement.

Abstract: Accurate real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for enabling digital twin applications across industries. While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.

Abstract: Financial prediction is a complex and challenging task of time series analysis and signal processing, expected to model both short-term fluctuations and long-term temporal dependencies. Transformers have remarkable success mostly in natural language processing using attention mechanism, which also influenced the time series community. The ability to capture both short and long-range dependencies helps to understand the financial market and to recognize price patterns, leading to successful applications of Transformers in stock prediction. Although, the previous research predominantly focuses on individual features and singular predictions, that limits the model's ability to understand broader market trends. In reality, within sectors such as finance and technology, companies belonging to the same industry often exhibit correlated stock price movements.
  In this paper, we develop a novel neural network architecture by integrating Time2Vec with the Encoder of the Transformer model. Based on the study of different markets, we propose a novel correlation feature selection method. Through a comprehensive fine-tuning of multiple hyperparameters, we conduct a comparative analysis of our results against benchmark models. We conclude that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art encoding methods such as positional encoding, and we also conclude that selecting correlation features enhance the accuracy of predicting multiple stock prices.

Abstract: Understanding biological processes, drug development, and biotechnological advancements requires a detailed analysis of protein structures and functions, a task that is inherently complex and time-consuming in traditional protein research. To streamline this process, we introduce ProteinGPT, a state-of-the-art multimodal large language model for proteins that enables users to upload protein sequences and/or structures for comprehensive analysis and responsive inquiries. ProteinGPT integrates protein sequence and structure encoders with linear projection layers to ensure precise representation adaptation and leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate, contextually relevant responses. To train ProteinGPT, we constructed a large-scale dataset of 132,092 proteins, each annotated with 20-30 property tags and 5-10 QA pairs per protein, and optimized the instruction-tuning process using GPT-4o. Experiments demonstrate that ProteinGPT effectively generates informative responses to protein-related questions, achieving high performance on both semantic and lexical metrics and significantly outperforming baseline models and general-purpose LLMs in understanding and responding to protein-related queries.

<div> Keywords: reflection coefficient, antenna, planar layered medium, generalized scattering matrix, numerical algorithm

Summary: 
The article presents a new numerical algorithm for evaluating the reflection coefficient of an antenna in the presence of a planar layered medium. This algorithm utilizes the antenna's generalized scattering matrix (GSM) to model the interaction between the antenna and the medium through spherical-to-planar vector wave transformations. By avoiding approximations that could compromise accuracy, the algorithm reduces algebraic complexity and significantly speeds up antenna performance evaluation. While a one-time preprocessing cost is required to obtain the antenna's GSM in free space, the numerical evaluation speed of this method surpasses that of commercial software FEKO by several orders of magnitude, maintaining high accuracy. This advancement in computational efficiency offers a promising approach for accurately evaluating antenna performance in complex scenarios involving layered media.

Abstract: The numerical algorithm for evaluating the reflection coefficient of an antenna in the presence of the planar layered medium is reformulated using the antenna's generalized scattering matrix (GSM). The interaction between the antenna and the layered medium is modeled through spherical-to-planar vector wave transformations, ensuring no approximations that could compromise computational accuracy. This theoretical framework significantly reduces algebraic complexity, resulting in a marked increase in the speed of antenna performance evaluation. Excluding the one-time preprocessing cost of obtaining the antenna's GSM in free space, the numerical evaluation speed of this method exceeds that of the commercial software FEKO by several orders of magnitude, while maintaining nearly identical accuracy.

Abstract: Engineering problems that apply machine learning often involve computationally intensive methods but rely on limited datasets. As engineering data evolves with new designs and constraints, models must incorporate new knowledge over time. However, high computational costs make retraining models from scratch infeasible. Continual learning (CL) offers a promising solution by enabling models to learn from sequential data while mitigating catastrophic forgetting, where a model forgets previously learned mappings. This work introduces CL to engineering design by benchmarking several CL methods on representative regression tasks. We apply these strategies to five engineering datasets and construct nine new engineering CL benchmarks to evaluate their ability to address forgetting and improve generalization. Preliminary results show that applying existing CL methods to these tasks improves performance over naive baselines. In particular, the Replay strategy achieved performance comparable to retraining in several benchmarks while reducing training time by nearly half, demonstrating its potential for real-world engineering workflows.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising hybrid quantum-classical methods designed to leverage the computational advantages of quantum computing while mitigating the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Although VQAs have been demonstrated as proofs of concept, their practical utility in solving real-world problems -- and whether quantum-inspired classical algorithms can match their performance -- remains an open question. We present a novel application of the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) and its classical neural quantum states-based counterpart, the variational neural linear solver (VNLS), as key components within a minimum map Newton solver for a complementarity-based rigid body contact model. We demonstrate using the VNLS that our solver accurately simulates the dynamics of rigid spherical bodies during collision events. These results suggest that quantum and quantum-inspired linear algebra algorithms can serve as viable alternatives to standard linear algebra solvers for modeling certain physical systems.

Summary:<br />
Offline model-based optimization (MBO) involves maximizing a black-box objective function using a dataset of designs and scores. Traditional methods use surrogate models but are prone to errors when predicting scores for new designs. To address this, DEMO introduces a diffusion prior to calibrate overly optimized designs. It generates pseudo design candidates using gradient ascent, then refines them through an editing process involving noise and denoising with the diffusion prior. Empirical evaluations across seven tasks show that DEMO, with proper tuning, achieves competitive scores compared to previous literature. <div>

Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to maximize a black-box objective function using only an offline dataset of designs and scores. These tasks span various domains, such as robotics, material design, and protein and molecular engineering. A common approach involves training a surrogate model using existing designs and their corresponding scores, and then generating new designs through gradient-based updates with respect to the surrogate model. This method suffers from the out-of-distribution issue, where the surrogate model may erroneously predict high scores for unseen designs. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method, Design Editing for Offline Model-based Optimization (DEMO), which leverages a diffusion prior to calibrate overly optimized designs. DEMO first generates pseudo design candidates by performing gradient ascent with respect to a surrogate model. While these pseudo design candidates contain information beyond the offline dataset, they might be invalid or have erroneously high predicted scores. Therefore, to address this challenge while utilizing the information provided by pseudo design candidates, we propose an editing process to refine these pseudo design candidates. We introduce noise to the pseudo design candidates and subsequently denoise them with a diffusion prior trained on the offline dataset, ensuring they align with the distribution of valid designs. Empirical evaluations on seven offline MBO tasks show that, with properly tuned hyperparameters, DEMOs score is competitive with the best previously reported scores in the literature.

Summary: 
The paper explores the computation of market equilibrium in scenarios with a large-scale buyer population using a deep learning-based method called MarketFCNet. The approach introduces a contextual market model where buyers and goods are represented by their contexts. MarketFCNet uses a neural network to parameterize the allocation of goods to buyers based on their contexts. An efficient method is proposed to estimate the loss function for training the network, enabling optimization through gradient descent. The Nash Gap metric is introduced to measure the deviation of the allocation and prices from the market equilibrium. Experimental results show that MarketFCNet outperforms existing methods in terms of performance and running times as the market scale increases, showcasing the potential of deep learning in approximating large-scale contextual market equilibrium. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Market equilibrium is one of the most fundamental solution concepts in economics and social optimization analysis. Existing works on market equilibrium computation primarily focus on settings with relatively few buyers. Motivated by this, our paper investigates the computation of market equilibrium in scenarios with a large-scale buyer population, where buyers and goods are represented by their contexts. Building on this realistic and generalized contextual market model, we introduce MarketFCNet, a deep learning-based method for approximating market equilibrium. We start by parameterizing the allocation of each good to each buyer using a neural network, which depends solely on the context of the buyer and the good. Next, we propose an efficient method to unbiasedly estimate the loss function of the training algorithm, enabling us to optimize the network parameters through gradient. To evaluate the approximated solution, we propose a metric called Nash Gap, which quantifies the deviation of the given allocation and price pair from the market equilibrium. Experimental results indicate that MarketFCNet delivers competitive performance and significantly lower running times compared to existing methods as the market scale expands, demonstrating the potential of deep learning-based methods to accelerate the approximation of large-scale contextual market equilibrium.

The experiments use a GJR-GARCH(1,1) model to simulate the dataset and evaluate against the Black-Scholes delta hedge baseline. Results show that MCPG and PPO perform best in terms of the root semi-quadratic penalty. MCPG outperforms the baseline within the allotted computational budget due to sparse rewards in the environment. This comparison provides insights into the effectiveness of different DRL algorithms in dynamic hedging strategies, with potential implications for financial risk management.

Abstract: Dynamic hedging is a financial strategy that consists in periodically transacting one or multiple financial assets to offset the risk associated with a correlated liability. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have been used to find optimal solutions to dynamic hedging problems by framing them as sequential decision-making problems. However, most previous work assesses the performance of only one or two DRL algorithms, making an objective comparison across algorithms difficult. In this paper, we compare the performance of eight DRL algorithms in the context of dynamic hedging; Monte Carlo Policy Gradient (MCPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), along with four variants of Deep Q-Learning (DQL) and two variants of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Two of these variants represent a novel application to the task of dynamic hedging. In our experiments, we use the Black-Scholes delta hedge as a baseline and simulate the dataset using a GJR-GARCH(1,1) model. Results show that MCPG, followed by PPO, obtain the best performance in terms of the root semi-quadratic penalty. Moreover, MCPG is the only algorithm to outperform the Black-Scholes delta hedge baseline with the allotted computational budget, possibly due to the sparsity of rewards in our environment.

<div> Keywords: self-supervised learning, deep learning, morphological profiling, high-throughput microscopy screens, chemical compound structure

Summary:
Recent advances in self-supervised deep learning have led to improved quantification of cellular morphological changes in high-throughput microscopy screens. The new framework, MICON (Molecular-Image Contrastive Learning), incorporates chemical compound information during pre-training to enhance learned image representations. MICON surpasses traditional feature extraction methods like CellProfiler and existing deep learning approaches, especially in identifying consistent effects of drugs across independent replicates and data centers. By modeling chemical compounds as treatments inducing counterfactual transformations of cell phenotypes, MICON outperforms methods that directly align images and compounds. This highlights the importance of considering the multimodal nature of microscopy screening data in representation learning for morphological profiling. MICON's success suggests a promising direction for future research in this field.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised deep learning have improved our ability to quantify cellular morphological changes in high-throughput microscopy screens, a process known as morphological profiling. However, most current methods only learn from images, despite many screens being inherently multimodal, as they involve both a chemical or genetic perturbation as well as an image-based readout. We hypothesized that incorporating chemical compound structure during self-supervised pre-training could improve learned representations of images in high-throughput microscopy screens. We introduce a representation learning framework, MICON (Molecular-Image Contrastive Learning), that models chemical compounds as treatments that induce counterfactual transformations of cell phenotypes. MICON significantly outperforms classical hand-crafted features such as CellProfiler and existing deep-learning-based representation learning methods in challenging evaluation settings where models must identify reproducible effects of drugs across independent replicates and data-generating centers. We demonstrate that incorporating chemical compound information into the learning process provides consistent improvements in our evaluation setting and that modeling compounds specifically as treatments in a causal framework outperforms approaches that directly align images and compounds in a single representation space. Our findings point to a new direction for representation learning in morphological profiling, suggesting that methods should explicitly account for the multimodal nature of microscopy screening data.

<title>A viscoplasticity model with an invariant-based non-Newtonian flow rule for unidirectional thermoplastic composites</title>

Abstract: A three-dimensional mesoscopic viscoplasticity model for simulating rate-dependent plasticity and creep in unidirectional thermoplastic composites is presented. The constitutive model is a transversely isotropic extension of an isotropic finite strain viscoplasticity model for neat polymers. Rate-dependent plasticity and creep are described by a non-Newtonian flow rule where the viscosity of the material depends on an equivalent stress measure through an Eyring-type relation. In the present formulation, transverse isotropy is incorporated by defining the equivalent stress measure and flow rule as functions of transversely isotropic stress invariants. In addition, the Eyring-type viscosity function is extended with anisotropic pressure dependence. As a result of the formulation, plastic flow in fiber direction is effectively excluded and pressure dependence of the polymer matrix is accounted for. The re-orientation of the transversely isotropic plane during plastic deformations is incorporated in the constitutive equations, allowing for an accurate large deformation response. The formulation is fully implicit and a consistent linearization of the algorithmic constitutive equations is performed to derive the consistent tangent modulus. The performance of the mesoscopic constitutive model is assessed through a comparison with a micromechanical model for carbon/PEEK, with the original isotropic viscoplastic version for the polymer matrix and with hyperelastic fibers. The micromodel is first used to determine the material parameters of the mesoscale model with a few stress-strain curves. It is demonstrated that the mesoscale model gives a similar response to the micromodel under various loading conditions. Finally, the mesoscale model is validated against off-axis experiments on unidirectional thermoplastic composite plies.

Abstract: Deep Material Network (DMN) has emerged as a powerful framework for multiscale material modeling, enabling efficient and accurate predictions of material behavior across different length scales. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, the trainable parameters in DMN have direct physical interpretations, capturing the geometric characteristics of the microstructure rather than serving as purely statistical fitting parameters. Its hierarchical tree structure effectively encodes microstructural interactions and deformation mechanisms, allowing DMN to achieve a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This physics-informed architecture significantly reduces computational costs compared to direct numerical simulations while preserving essential microstructural physics. Furthermore, DMN can be trained solely on a linear elastic dataset while effectively extrapolating nonlinear responses during online prediction, making it a highly efficient and scalable approach for multiscale material modeling. This article provides a comprehensive review of DMN, detailing its motivation, underlying methodology, and recent advancements. We discuss key modeling aspects, including its hierarchical structure, training process, and the role of physics-based constraints in enhancing predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we highlight its applications in component-scale multiscale analysis and inverse parameter identification, demonstrating its capability to bridge microscale material behavior with macroscale engineering predictions. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions in improving DMN's generalization capabilities and its potential extensions for broader applications in multiscale modeling.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency users increasingly rely on obfuscation techniques such as mixers, swappers, and decentralised or no-KYC exchanges to protect their anonymity. However, at the same time, these services are exploited by criminals to conceal and launder illicit funds. Among obfuscation services, mixers remain one of the most challenging entities to tackle. This is because their owners are often unwilling to cooperate with Law Enforcement Agencies, and technically, they operate as 'black boxes'. To better understand their functionalities, this paper proposes an approach to analyse the operations of mixers by examining their address-transaction graphs and identifying topological similarities to uncover common patterns that can define the mixer's modus operandi. The approach utilises community detection algorithms to extract dense topological structures and clustering algorithms to group similar communities. The analysis is further enriched by incorporating data from external sources related to known Exchanges, in order to understand their role in mixer operations. The approach is applied to dissect the Blender.io mixer activities within the Bitcoin blockchain, revealing: i) consistent structural patterns across address-transaction graphs; ii) that Exchanges play a key role, following a well-established pattern, which raises several concerns about their AML/KYC policies. This paper represents an initial step toward dissecting and understanding the complex nature of mixer operations in cryptocurrency networks and extracting their modus operandi.

Abstract: Phosphorylation site prediction based on kinase-substrate interaction plays a vital role in understanding cellular signaling pathways and disease mechanisms. Computational methods for this task can be categorized into kinase-family-focused and individual kinase-targeted approaches. Individual kinase-targeted methods have gained prominence for their ability to explore a broader protein space and provide more precise target information for kinase inhibitors. However, most existing individual kinase-based approaches focus solely on sequence inputs, neglecting crucial structural information. To address this limitation, we introduce SAGEPhos (Structure-aware kinAse-substrate bio-coupled and bio-auGmented nEtwork for Phosphorylation site prediction), a novel framework that modifies the semantic space of main protein inputs using auxiliary inputs at two distinct modality levels. At the inter-modality level, SAGEPhos introduces a Bio-Coupled Modal Fusion method, distilling essential kinase sequence information to refine task-oriented local substrate feature space, creating a shared semantic space that captures crucial kinase-substrate interaction patterns. Within the substrate's intra-modality domain, it focuses on Bio-Augmented Fusion, emphasizing 2D local sequence information while selectively incorporating 3D spatial information from predicted structures to complement the sequence space. Moreover, to address the lack of structural information in current datasets, we contribute a new, refined phosphorylation site prediction dataset, which incorporates crucial structural elements and will serve as a new benchmark for the field. Experimental results demonstrate that SAGEPhos significantly outperforms baseline methods. We release the SAGEPhos models and code at https://github.com/ZhangJJ26/SAGEPhos.

<title>QPET: A Versatile and Portable Quantity-of-Interest-Preservation Framework for Error-Bounded Lossy Compression</title>

Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression has been widely adopted in many scientific domains because it can address the challenges in storing, transferring, and analyzing unprecedented amounts of scientific data. Although error-bounded lossy compression offers general data distortion control by enforcing strict error bounds on raw data, it may fail to meet the quality requirements on the results of downstream analysis, a.k.a. Quantities of Interest (QoIs), derived from raw data. This may lead to uncertainties and even misinterpretations in scientific discoveries, significantly limiting the use of lossy compression in practice. In this paper, we propose QPET, a novel, versatile, and portable framework for QoI-preserving error-bounded lossy compression, which overcomes the challenges of modeling diverse QoIs by leveraging numerical strategies. QPET features (1) high portability to multiple existing lossy compressors, (2) versatile preservation to most differentiable univariate and multivariate QoIs, and (3) significant compression improvements in QoI-preservation tasks. Experiments with six real-world datasets demonstrate that integrating QPET into state-of-the-art error-bounded lossy compressors can gain 2x to 10x compression speedups of existing QoI-preserving error-bounded lossy compression solutions, up to 1000% compression ratio improvements to general-purpose compressors, and up to 133% compression ratio improvements to existing QoI-integrated scientific compressors.

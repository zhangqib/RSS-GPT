Summary:
The study introduces a discrete physics-informed neural network (dPINN) framework with enforced interface constraints (EIC) for modeling physical systems using the domain decomposition method (DDM).

The EIC enforces interfacial displacement constraints to ensure physical field continuity without auxiliary sampling or loss penalties, supporting independent meshing in each subdomain. By eliminating weak spatial constraints (WSC), the EIC-dPINN provides more stable and physically consistent predictions. Extensive numerical experiments in two and three dimensions confirm the framework's accuracy and showcase computational efficiency gains through parallel training.

Abstract: This study presents a discrete physics-informed neural network (dPINN) framework, enhanced with enforced interface constraints (EIC), for modeling physical systems using the domain decomposition method (DDM). Built upon finite element-style mesh discretization, the dPINN accurately evaluates system energy through Gaussian quadrature-based element-wise integration. To ensure physical field continuity across subdomain interfaces, the EIC mechanism enforces interfacial displacement constraints without requiring auxiliary sampling or loss penalties.This formulation supports independent meshing in each subdomain, simplifying preprocessing and improving computational flexibility. Additionally, by eliminating the influence of weak spatial constraints (WSC) commonly observed in traditional PINNs, the EIC-dPINN delivers more stable and physically consistent predictions.Extensive two- and three-dimensional numerical experiments validate the proposed framework's accuracy and demonstrate the computational efficiency gains achieved through parallel training. The results highlight the framework's scalability, robustness, and potential for solving large-scale, geometrically complex problems.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, DeepFund, real-time market data, fund investment, evaluation

Summary:<br>
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial tasks but their effectiveness in fund investment remains unexplored. To address limitations in evaluating LLM-driven trading strategies, a new benchmark tool called DeepFund is introduced. DeepFund directly connects with real-time stock market data to prevent information leakage and provide fair evaluations. Test results on nine top LLMs reveal challenges in various investment dimensions, showcasing practical limitations in active fund management. Even advanced models like DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet incur net trading losses in the real-time evaluation environment of DeepFund. This highlights the current constraints of LLMs in active fund management.<br> <div>
arXiv:2505.11065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable capabilities across financial tasks, including financial report summarization, earnings call transcript analysis, and asset classification. However, their real-world effectiveness in managing complex fund investment remains inadequately assessed. A fundamental limitation of existing benchmarks for evaluating LLM-driven trading strategies is their reliance on historical back-testing, inadvertently enabling LLMs to "time travel"-leveraging future information embedded in their training corpora, thus resulting in possible information leakage and overly optimistic performance estimates. To address this issue, we introduce DeepFund, a live fund benchmark tool designed to rigorously evaluate LLM in real-time market conditions. Utilizing a multi-agent architecture, DeepFund connects directly with real-time stock market data-specifically data published after each model pretraining cutoff-to ensure fair and leakage-free evaluations. Empirical tests on nine flagship LLMs from leading global institutions across multiple investment dimensions-including ticker-level analysis, investment decision-making, portfolio management, and risk control-reveal significant practical challenges. Notably, even cutting-edge models such as DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-3.7-Sonnet incur net trading losses within DeepFund real-time evaluation environment, underscoring the present limitations of LLMs for active fund management.

Abstract: Predicting protein function from sequence is a central challenge in computational biology. While existing methods rely heavily on structured ontologies or similarity-based techniques, they often lack the flexibility to express structure-free functional descriptions and novel biological functions. In this work, we introduce Prot2Text-V2, a novel multimodal sequence-to-text model that generates free-form natural language descriptions of protein function directly from amino acid sequences. Our method combines a protein language model as a sequence encoder (ESM-3B) and a decoder-only language model (LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct) through a lightweight nonlinear modality projector. A key innovation is our Hybrid Sequence-level Contrastive Alignment Learning (H-SCALE), which improves cross-modal learning by matching mean- and std-pooled protein embeddings with text representations via contrastive loss. After the alignment phase, we apply instruction-based fine-tuning using LoRA on the decoder to teach the model how to generate accurate protein function descriptions conditioned on the protein sequence. We train Prot2Text-V2 on about 250K curated entries from SwissProt and evaluate it under low-homology conditions, where test sequences have low similarity with training samples. Prot2Text-V2 consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across various metrics.

Summary:
GLOVA is introduced as an analog circuit sizing framework to address challenges in variation-aware design. It utilizes risk-sensitive reinforcement learning to improve robustness against PVT variations, with an ensemble-based critic for efficient learning. A $\mu$-$\sigma$ evaluation and simulation reordering method is proposed for design verification, reducing simulation costs. GLOVA supports industrial-level PVT variation evaluation methods, including corner simulation and global/local Monte Carlo simulations.

Abstract: Analog/mixed-signal circuit design encounters significant challenges due to performance degradation from process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. To achieve commercial-grade reliability, iterative manual design revisions and extensive statistical simulations are required. While several studies have aimed to automate variation aware analog design to reduce time-to-market, the substantial mismatches in real-world wafers have not been thoroughly addressed. In this paper, we present GLOVA, an analog circuit sizing framework that effectively manages the impact of diverse random mismatches to improve robustness against PVT variations. In the proposed approach, risk-sensitive reinforcement learning is leveraged to account for the reliability bound affected by PVT variations, and ensemble-based critic is introduced to achieve sample-efficient learning. For design verification, we also propose $\mu$-$\sigma$ evaluation and simulation reordering method to reduce simulation costs of identifying failed designs. GLOVA supports verification through industrial-level PVT variation evaluation methods, including corner simulation as well as global and local Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Compared to previous state-of-the-art variation-aware analog sizing frameworks, GLOVA achieves up to 80.5$\times$ improvement in sample efficiency and 76.0$\times$ reduction in time.

<div> Keywords: social emergence, large language model agents, multi-agent framework, socio-economic systems, emergent phenomena

Summary: 
 This study introduces TwinMarket, a new framework that uses large language model agents to simulate socio-economic systems. Traditional modeling approaches struggle to capture the complexity of human behavior, but TwinMarket's use of LLMs allows for more realistic simulations. By focusing on individual behaviors and their interactions, the framework demonstrates how collective dynamics and emergent phenomena can arise. The experiments conducted in a simulated stock market environment show how individual actions can lead to group behaviors, resulting in outcomes such as financial bubbles and recessions. This approach provides valuable insights into the intricate relationship between individual decision-making and collective socio-economic patterns. Overall, TwinMarket offers a promising avenue for studying social emergence and understanding the complexities of human behavior in socio-economic systems.

Abstract: The study of social emergence has long been a central focus in social science. Traditional modeling approaches, such as rule-based Agent-Based Models (ABMs), struggle to capture the diversity and complexity of human behavior, particularly the irrational factors emphasized in behavioral economics. Recently, large language model (LLM) agents have gained traction as simulation tools for modeling human behavior in social science and role-playing applications. Studies suggest that LLMs can account for cognitive biases, emotional fluctuations, and other non-rational influences, enabling more realistic simulations of socio-economic dynamics. In this work, we introduce TwinMarket, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages LLMs to simulate socio-economic systems. Specifically, we examine how individual behaviors, through interactions and feedback mechanisms, give rise to collective dynamics and emergent phenomena. Through experiments in a simulated stock market environment, we demonstrate how individual actions can trigger group behaviors, leading to emergent outcomes such as financial bubbles and recessions. Our approach provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between individual decision-making and collective socio-economic patterns.

<div> tensor networks, data compression, program synthesis, constraint-based assessment, search efficiency 

Summary: 
Tensor networks are effective for compressing multi-dimensional data, but finding the optimal structure is challenging. This study proposes a novel approach that views tensor network structure search as a program synthesis problem. By establishing a link between transformation programs and network structures, the method reduces the search space using output-directed splits. A synthesis algorithm identifies promising network candidates through constraint solving, minimizing the need for costly tensor decomposition. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in search speed, achieving compression ratios surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 1.5 to 3 times. The approach also scales effectively to larger tensors and generalizes well to similar data, outperforming generic structures with compression ratios up to 2.4 times better. This enhanced efficiency and effectiveness make the proposed method a valuable tool for data compression tasks. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Tensor networks provide a powerful framework for compressing multi-dimensional data. The optimal tensor network structure for a given data tensor depends on both data characteristics and specific optimality criteria, making tensor network structure search a difficult problem. Existing solutions typically rely on sampling and compressing numerous candidate structures; these procedures are computationally expensive and therefore limiting for practical applications. We address this challenge by viewing tensor network structure search as a program synthesis problem and introducing an efficient constraint-based assessment method that avoids costly tensor decomposition. Specifically, we establish a correspondence between transformation programs and network structures. We also design a novel operation named output-directed splits to reduce the search space without hindering expressiveness. We then propose a synthesis algorithm to identify promising network candidates through constraint solving, and avoid tensor decomposition for all but the most promising candidates. Experimental results show that our approach improves search speed by up to $10\times$ and achieves compression ratios $1.5\times$ to $3\times$ better than state-of-the-art. Notably, our approach scales to larger tensors that are unattainable by prior work. Furthermore, the discovered topologies generalize well to similar data, yielding compression ratios up to $ 2.4\times$ better than a generic structure while the runtime remains around $110$ seconds.

Abstract: Financial reinforcement learning (FinRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for sequential decision-making in financial engineering. However, applying RL in real-world trading tasks remains challenging due to the non-stationarity of financial data, low signal-to-noise ratios, and various market frictions. Although numerous FinRL methods have been developed for tasks such as trading and portfolio management, the lack of standardized task definitions, datasets, environments, and baselines has hindered consistent evaluation and reproducibility. To bridge this gap, we organized three FinRL Contests from 2023 to 2025, covering a diverse range of financial tasks such as stock trading, order execution, cryptocurrency trading, and the use of large language model (LLM)-generated signals. These contests attracted 200 participants from over 100 institutions across 22 countries. To promote reproduction, we provided open-source starter kits featuring GPU-optimized parallel market environments and comprehensive documentation. In this paper, we summarize these benchmarking efforts, detailing task formulations, data curation pipelines, environment implementations, evaluation protocols, participant performance, and key organizational insights.

Summary: 
The article introduces GlassVAE, a hierarchical graph variational autoencoder designed to handle the complexity of disordered materials like glasses. GlassVAE uses graph representations to create rotation, translation, and permutation invariant embeddings of atomic configurations, enabling efficient generation of realistic structures and exploration of the glass energy landscape. To ensure structural realism and physical fidelity, GlassVAE is augmented with two physics-informed regularizers: a radial distribution function (RDF) loss and an energy regression loss. The regularizers play a crucial role in enhancing the accuracy of the model. By encoding high-dimensional atomistic data into a compact latent vector and decoding it to generate structures with accurate energy predictions, GlassVAE provides a rapid, physics-aware approach for modeling and designing disordered materials. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2505.09977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered materials such as glasses, unlike crystals, lack long range atomic order and have no periodic unit cells, yielding a high dimensional configuration space with widely varying properties. The complexity not only increases computational costs for atomistic simulations but also makes it difficult for generative AI models to deliver accurate property predictions and realistic structure generation. In this work, we introduce GlassVAE, a hierarchical graph variational autoencoder that uses graph representations to learn compact, rotation, translation, and permutation invariant embeddings of atomic configurations. The resulting structured latent space not only enables efficient generation of novel, physically plausible structures but also supports exploration of the glass energy landscape. To enforce structural realism and physical fidelity, we augment GlassVAE with two physics informed regularizers, a radial distribution function (RDF) loss that captures characteristic short and medium range ordering and an energy regression loss that reflects the broad configurational energetics. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results highlight the critical impact of these regularizers. By encoding high dimensional atomistic data into a compact latent vector and decoding it into structures with accurate energy predictions, GlassVAE provides a fast, physics aware path for modeling and designing disordered materials.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces Space-Time MultiGrid (STMG) methods for topology optimization in transient heat conduction problems. The methods employ pointwise smoothers and uniform Cartesian space-time meshes, with a coarsening strategy based on the geometric mean of minimum and maximum diffusivity for high contrast problems. Different discretization methods for coarse levels were tested, with averaging thermal resistivities on finer levels showing best results for one-dimensional cases. A proposed coarsening strategy ensuring spatial resolution on coarse grids yielded mixed results. The STMG methods successfully served as a solver for one-dimensional topology optimization, including solving the adjoint problem. The methods were robust and converged reliably during optimization cycles. They proved effective for the adjoint problem even when the prolongation operator only forwards information in time, despite the adjoint problem moving backwards in time. <div>

Abstract: This paper presents Space-Time MultiGrid (STMG) methods which are suitable for performing topology optimisation of transient heat conduction problems. The proposed methods use a pointwise smoother and uniform Cartesian space-time meshes. For problems with high contrast in the diffusivity, it was found that it is beneficial to define a coarsening strategy based on the geometric mean of the minimum and maximum diffusivity. However, other coarsening strategies may be better for other smoothers. Several methods of discretising the coarse levels were tested. Of these, it was best to use a method which averages the thermal resistivities on the finer levels. However, this was likely a consequence of the fact that only one spatial dimension was considered for the test problems. A second coarsening strategy was proposed which ensures spatial resolution on the coarse grids. Mixed results were found for this strategy. The proposed STMG methods were used as a solver for a one-dimensional topology optimisation problem. In this context, the adjoint problem was also solved using the STMG methods. The STMG methods were sufficiently robust for this application, since they converged during every optimisation cycle. It was found that the STMG methods also work for the adjoint problem when the prolongation operator only sends information forwards in time, even although the direction of time for the adjoint problem is backwards.

Abstract: With the growing demand for healthy foods, agricultural product price forecasting has become increasingly important. Hass avocados, as a high-value crop, exhibit complex price fluctuations influenced by factors such as seasonality, region, and weather. Traditional prediction models often struggle with highly nonlinear and dynamic data. To address this, we propose a hybrid deep learning model, TCN-MLP-Attention Architecture, combining Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) for sequential feature extraction, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) for nonlinear interactions, and an Attention mechanism for dynamic feature weighting. The dataset used covers over 50,000 records of Hass avocado sales across the U.S. from 2015 to 2018, including variables such as sales volume, average price, time, region, weather, and variety type, collected from point-of-sale systems and the Hass Avocado Board. After systematic preprocessing, including missing value imputation and feature normalization, the proposed model was trained and evaluated. Experimental results demonstrate that the TCN-MLP-Attention model achieves excellent predictive performance, with an RMSE of 1.23 and an MSE of 1.51, outperforming traditional methods. This research provides a scalable and effective approach for time series forecasting in agricultural markets and offers valuable insights for intelligent supply chain management and price strategy optimization.

This work introduces a neural network framework for chemical reactor modeling that can generalize across different reactor types and quickly adapt to new chemical processes. By leveraging meta-learning, the model is pretrained on a wide range of reactor dynamics, allowing for efficient adaptation to unseen reactions with minimal data. Additionally, physics-informed fine-tuning is incorporated to ensure consistent adaptation to new reactor conditions. The framework is evaluated on three fundamental reactor types, showing superior few-shot adaptation compared to traditional approaches.

Abstract: Developing accurate models for chemical reactors is often challenging due to the complexity of reaction kinetics and process dynamics. Traditional approaches require retraining models for each new system, limiting generalizability and efficiency. In this work, we take a step toward foundation models for chemical reactor modeling by introducing a neural network framework that generalizes across diverse reactor types and rapidly adapts to new chemical processes. Our approach leverages meta-learning to pretrain the model on a broad set of reactor dynamics, enabling efficient adaptation to unseen reactions with minimal data. To further enhance generalizability, we incorporate physics-informed fine-tuning, ensuring physically consistent adaptation to new reactor conditions. Our framework is evaluated across three integer-order fundamental reactor types - continuous stirred tank reactors, batch reactors, and plug flow reactors - demonstrating superior few-shot adaptation compared to conventional data-driven, physics-informed, and transfer learning approaches. By combining meta-learning with physics-informed adaptation, this work lays the foundation for a generalizable modeling framework, advancing the development of foundation models for chemical engineering applications.

<br />
Summary:
The article introduces a hybrid deep learning model, RoBERTa-BiLSTM, combining RoBERTa and BiLSTM for sentiment analysis. Challenges in sentiment analysis include lexical diversity, long dependencies, unknown symbols, and imbalanced datasets. Existing models like BERT and RoBERTa face issues with processing time due to sequential nature. The RoBERTa-BiLSTM model aims to address these challenges by leveraging RoBERTa for word embeddings and BiLSTM for contextual semantics. Experimental results on IMDb, Twitter US Airline, and Sentiment140 datasets show RoBERTa-BiLSTM outperforming baseline models like BERT and RoBERTa, achieving high accuracies and F1 scores. The model achieves accuracies of 80.74%, 92.36%, and 82.25% on the respective datasets, with corresponding F1 scores. This hybrid approach demonstrates improved performance in sentiment analysis tasks.

Abstract: Effectively analyzing the comments to uncover latent intentions holds immense value in making strategic decisions across various domains. However, several challenges hinder the process of sentiment analysis including the lexical diversity exhibited in comments, the presence of long dependencies within the text, encountering unknown symbols and words, and dealing with imbalanced datasets. Moreover, existing sentiment analysis tasks mostly leveraged sequential models to encode the long dependent texts and it requires longer execution time as it processes the text sequentially. In contrast, the Transformer requires less execution time due to its parallel processing nature. In this work, we introduce a novel hybrid deep learning model, RoBERTa-BiLSTM, which combines the Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. RoBERTa is utilized to generate meaningful word embedding vectors, while BiLSTM effectively captures the contextual semantics of long-dependent texts. The RoBERTa-BiLSTM hybrid model leverages the strengths of both sequential and Transformer models to enhance performance in sentiment analysis. We conducted experiments using datasets from IMDb, Twitter US Airline, and Sentiment140 to evaluate the proposed model against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the RoBERTa-BiLSTM model surpasses baseline models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa-base, RoBERTa-GRU, and RoBERTa-LSTM), achieving accuracies of 80.74%, 92.36%, and 82.25% on the Twitter US Airline, IMDb, and Sentiment140 datasets, respectively. Additionally, the model achieves F1-scores of 80.73%, 92.35%, and 82.25% on the same datasets, respectively.

<div> methodology, digital twins, personalized medicine, uncertainty quantification, tumor progression

Summary: 
This study introduces an end-to-end methodology for personalized modeling in biomedicine, using digital twins to improve individual patient outcomes by combining patient data with mechanistic models of disease progression. The approach integrates longitudinal non-invasive imaging data with a reaction-diffusion model to estimate and predict spatiotemporal tumor progression while considering patient-specific anatomy. By solving a statistical inverse problem, imaging data inform spatially varying model parameters. An efficient parallel implementation of the forward model and scalable Bayesian posterior distribution approximation enable rigorous uncertainty quantification due to sparse, noisy measurements. The methodology is validated using synthetic data on a virtual patient to account for model limitations, noise level, and data frequency. Decision-making applications are demonstrated by evaluating the impact of imaging frequency and optimal experimental design. Clinical relevance is illustrated through model validation on a cohort of patients with longitudinal imaging data, showcasing the potential for risk-informed personalized medicine.

Abstract: Quantifying the uncertainty in predictive models is critical for establishing trust and enabling risk-informed decision making for personalized medicine. In contrast to one-size-fits-all approaches that seek to mitigate risk at the population level, digital twins enable personalized modeling thereby potentially improving individual patient outcomes. Realizing digital twins in biomedicine requires scalable and efficient methods to integrate patient data with mechanistic models of disease progression. This study develops an end-to-end data-to-decisions methodology that combines longitudinal non-invasive imaging data with mechanistic models to estimate and predict spatiotemporal tumor progression accounting for patient-specific anatomy. Through the solution of a statistical inverse problem, imaging data inform the spatially varying parameters of a reaction-diffusion model of tumor progression. An efficient parallel implementation of the forward model coupled with a scalable approximation of the Bayesian posterior distribution enables rigorous, but tractable, quantification of uncertainty due to the sparse, noisy measurements. The methodology is verified on a virtual patient with synthetic data to control for model inadequacy, noise level, and the frequency of data collection. The application to decision-making is illustrated by evaluating the importance of imaging frequency and formulating an optimal experimental design question. The clinical relevance is demonstrated through a model validation study on a cohort of patients with publicly available longitudinal imaging data.

Summary: 
The article explores the application of asymptotic post-buckling theory in sizing and topology optimization of trusses and frames, highlighting its potential benefits and existing computational challenges. By incorporating the lowest two asymptotic coefficients in the optimization formulation, representing initial post-buckling slope and curvature, designers can control the post-buckling response and reduce imperfection sensitivity in optimized designs. The asymptotic expansion enables the approximation of structural nonlinear response, allowing optimization for specific measures of nonlinear mechanical performance such as end-compliance or complementary work. The study demonstrates the effective use of the asymptotic method in including post-buckling constraints in structural optimization through examples of linear and nonlinear compliance minimization for trusses and frames. <div>

Abstract: Asymptotic post-buckling theory is applied to sizing and topology optimization of trusses and frames, exploring its potential and current computational difficulties. We show that a designs' post-buckling response can be controlled by including the lowest two asymptotic coefficients, representing the initial post-buckling slope and curvature, in the optimization formulation. This also reduces the imperfection sensitivity of the optimized design. The asymptotic expansion can further be used to approximate the structural nonlinear response, and then to optimize for a given measure of the nonlinear mechanical performance such as, for example, end-compliance or complementary work. Examples of linear and nonlinear compliance minimization of trusses and frames show the effective use of the asymptotic method for including post-buckling constraints in structural optimization.

Summary: 
The study focuses on creating a comprehensive dataset for modeling and predicting household radon concentrations at small scales in Pennsylvania and Utah. It aims to identify at-risk populations in areas with high radon levels by examining geological and demographic factors. The dataset combines information on temperature, geochemistry, soil characteristics, and demographic variables such as heating fuel used and building age. This data serves as a foundational resource for future studies and can be scaled up to predict radon exposure potential at a national level. By identifying populations at risk, this research helps in mitigating the risk of lung cancer due to elevated radon levels in homes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Exposure to elevated radon levels in the home is one of the leading causes of lung cancer in the world. The following study describes the creation of a comprehensive, state-level dataset designed to enable the modeling and prediction of household radon concentrations at Zip Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) and sub-kilometer scales. Details include the data collection and processing involved in compiling physical and demographic factors for Pennsylvania and Utah. Attempting to mitigate this risk requires identifying the underlying geological causes and the populations that might be at risk. This work focuses on identifying at-risk populations throughout Pennsylvania and Utah, where radon levels are some of the highest in the country. The resulting dataset harmonizes geological and demographic factors from various sources and spatial resolutions, including temperature, geochemistry, and soil characteristics. Demographic variables such as the household heating fuel used, the age of building, and the housing type provide further insight into which populations could be most susceptible in areas with potentially high radon levels. This dataset also serves as a foundational resource for two other studies conducted by the authors. The resolution of the data provides a novel approach to predicting potential radon exposure, and the data processing conducted for these states can be scaled up to larger spatial resolutions (e.g., the Contiguous United States [CONUS]) and allow for a broad reclassification of radon exposure potential in the United States.

Abstract: In this paper, we present Deep-MacroFin, a comprehensive framework designed to solve partial differential equations, with a particular focus on models in continuous time economics. This framework leverages deep learning methodologies, including Multi-Layer Perceptrons and the newly developed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. It is optimized using economic information encapsulated by Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and coupled algebraic equations.

Importantly, it offers a more efficient (5$\times$ less CUDA memory and 40$\times$ fewer FLOPs in 100D problems) and user-friendly implementation than existing libraries. We also incorporate a time-stepping scheme to enhance training stability for nonlinear HJB equations, enabling the solution of 50D economic models.

<div> Keywords: ventral visual stream, object recognition, relative position prediction, unsupervised task-driven method, brain similarity<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new function of the ventral visual stream (VVS) called relative position (RP) prediction, in addition to its role in object recognition. It criticizes current unsupervised task-driven methods for modeling VVS through contrastive learning, arguing that this approach may not capture the capabilities of RP prediction. To address this, a new method that integrates RP learning with contrastive learning is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that this new approach improves object recognition performance and enhances RP predictivity, ultimately leading to better model brain similarity. These findings suggest that the VVS may play a role in location perception, particularly in RP prediction, highlighting the need for a more comprehensive understanding of its functions. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.08316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the concept that ventral visual stream (VVS) mainly functions for object recognition, current unsupervised task-driven methods model VVS by contrastive learning, and have achieved good brain similarity. However, we believe functions of VVS extend beyond just object recognition. In this paper, we introduce an additional function involving VVS, named relative position (RP) prediction. We first theoretically explain contrastive learning may be unable to yield the model capability of RP prediction. Motivated by this, we subsequently integrate RP learning with contrastive learning, and propose a new unsupervised task-driven method to model VVS, which is more inline with biological reality. We conduct extensive experiments, demonstrating that: (i) our method significantly improves downstream performance of object recognition while enhancing RP predictivity; (ii) RP predictivity generally improves the model brain similarity. Our results provide strong evidence for the involvement of VVS in location perception (especially RP prediction) from a computational perspective.

Summary:<br /><br />This manuscript presents an approach for optimizing the connectivity and elevation of grid-shell structures under pure compression or tension, considering external loading and self-weight. The method involves solving a second-order cone optimization problem to ensure convexity and globally optimal solutions. Numerical examples demonstrate the characteristics of these optimal structures, showing the importance of simultaneous topology and geometry optimization. The study reveals that as self-weight increases, optimal topology and elevation profiles change significantly. The approach provides more accurate solutions and is vastly quicker than traditional 3D layout/truss topology optimization methods. This research underscores the significance of integrating topology and geometry optimization from the initial design phase for efficient and effective structural design. <div>

Abstract: This manuscript presents an approach for simultaneously optimizing the connectivity and elevation of grid-shell structures acting in pure compression (or pure tension) under the combined effects of a prescribed external loading and the design-dependent self-weight of the structure itself. The method derived herein involves solving a second-order cone optimization problem, thereby ensuring convexity and obtaining globally optimal results for a given discretization of the design domain. Several numerical examples are presented, illustrating characteristics of this class of optimal structures. It is found that, as self-weight becomes more significant, both the optimal topology and the optimal elevation profile of the structure change, highlighting the importance of optimizing both topology and geometry simultaneously from the earliest stages of design. It is shown that this approach can obtain solutions with greater accuracy and several orders of magnitude more quickly than a standard 3D layout/truss topology optimization approach.

Summary: This study explores the value of information from Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems monitoring corrosion-induced thickness loss (CITL) in ship hulls. The research utilizes a Bayesian pre-posterior decision analysis to quantify the benefits of SHM in optimizing hull maintenance. Decision consequence cost functions based on exceedance probabilities relative to a target CITL threshold are defined, allowing for practical decision-making based on risk perception. A high-fidelity numerical model of a commercial vessel is used to compare the benefits of different CITL monitoring strategies, including strain-based SHM and traditional on-site inspections. The findings provide insights into the potential of SHM in enhancing maintenance practices for ship structures. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) have attracted industry interest, yet real-world applications, such as in ship structures remain scarce. Despite SHM's potential to optimise maintenance, its adoption in ships is limited due to the lack of clearly quantifiable benefits for hull maintenance. This study employs a Bayesian pre-posterior decision analysis to quantify the value of information (VoI) from SHM systems monitoring corrosion-induced thickness loss (CITL) in ship hulls, in a first-of-its-kind analysis for ship structures. We define decision-making consequence cost functions based on exceedance probabilities relative to a target CITL threshold, which can be set by the decision-maker. This introduces a practical aspect to our framework, that enables implicitly modelling the decision-maker's risk perception. We apply this framework to a large-scale, high-fidelity numerical model of a commercial vessel and examine the relative benefits of different CITL monitoring strategies, including strain-based SHM and traditional on-site inspections.

The computational framework QUEST solves the matching and assignment problems by formulating them as a mixed-integer quadratic problem and encoding them as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization for quantum processing. Classical methods such as the Hungarian Algorithm and quantum algorithms like Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) are used to solve the assignment problem. The quantum implementation successfully identifies the optimal assignment, demonstrating the effectiveness of the QUEST pipeline for controlled prototypes. This study paves the way for addressing more complex scenarios and leveraging quantum technologies for large-scale shared-transportation instances. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce ``Windbreaking-as-a-Service'' (WaaS) as an innovative approach to shared transportation in which larger ``windbreaker'' vehicles provide aerodynamic shelter for ``windsurfer'' vehicles, thereby reducing drag and fuel consumption. As a computational framework to solve the large-scale matching and assignment problems that arise in WaaS, we present \textbf{QUEST} (Quantum-Enhanced Shared Transportation). Specifically, we formulate the pairing of windbreakers and windsurfers -- subject to timing, speed, and vehicle-class constraints -- as a mixed-integer quadratic problem (MIQP). Focusing on a single-segment prototype, we verify the solution classically via the Hungarian Algorithm, a Gurobi-based solver, and brute-force enumeration of binary vectors. We then encode the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) and map it to an Ising Hamiltonian, enabling the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and other quantum and classical annealing technologies. Our quantum implementation successfully recovers the optimal assignment identified by the classical methods, confirming the soundness of the QUEST pipeline for a controlled prototype. While QAOA and other quantum heuristics do not guarantee a resolution of the fundamental complexity barriers, this study illustrates how the WaaS problem can be systematically translated into a quantum-ready model. It also lays the groundwork for addressing multi-segment scenarios and potentially leveraging quantum advantage for large-scale shared-transportation instances.

The article introduces Sensitivity-Constrained Fourier Neural Operators (SC-FNO) to address limitations faced by deep learning frameworks like the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) in solving parametric differential equations. SC-FNO includes a sensitivity-based regularization strategy that improves accuracy in predicting solution paths and outperforms standard FNO and FNO with physics-informed regularization. It is particularly effective in parameter inversion tasks and can handle high-dimensional parameter spaces with up to 82 parameters. SC-FNO reduces data and training requirements while achieving high performance across different types of differential equations and neural operators. Although there is a slight increase in training time, the benefits of SC-FNO are significant in terms of accuracy and scalability. The code and selected experiments for SC-FNO are available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>

Abstract: Parametric differential equations of the form du/dt = f(u, x, t, p) are fundamental in science and engineering. While deep learning frameworks such as the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) can efficiently approximate solutions, they struggle with inverse problems, sensitivity estimation (du/dp), and concept drift. We address these limitations by introducing a sensitivity-based regularization strategy, called Sensitivity-Constrained Fourier Neural Operators (SC-FNO). SC-FNO achieves high accuracy in predicting solution paths and consistently outperforms standard FNO and FNO with physics-informed regularization. It improves performance in parameter inversion tasks, scales to high-dimensional parameter spaces (tested with up to 82 parameters), and reduces both data and training requirements. These gains are achieved with a modest increase in training time (30% to 130% per epoch) and generalize across various types of differential equations and neural operators.

<div> Keywords: RAAC, corrosion, modeling, porosity, collapse  

<br /><br />Summary: The study addresses the issue of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) panel collapses, which have gained significant attention due to safety concerns. A lack of detailed experimental data and the lengthy process of replicating natural corrosion has underscored the importance of computational modeling in this context. Researchers suspect that the high porosity of RAAC contributes to corrosion concealment; however, existing models for corrosion-induced cracking have limited capabilities in incorporating concrete porosity effects. To improve this, the authors introduce an enriched model that integrates analytical solutions of reactive transport equations with a porosity-dependent diffusivity description. This innovative approach allows for the first computational exploration of corrosion concealment in RAAC panels. The findings reveal that RAAC panels can experience sudden collapses without visible indicators of surface cracking due to corrosion. Additionally, the research identifies the specific conditions that increase the likelihood of sudden collapse, enhancing the understanding of RAAC durability under corrosive environments. This work provides crucial insights for engineers and researchers concerned with the structural integrity and safety of RAAC constructions. <div>
arXiv:2505.06294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collapse of reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete (RAAC) panels has attracted considerable public and academic interest. As detailed experimental data are not yet available and replicating the natural corrosion process requires years or decades, computational modelling is essential to understand under which conditions corrosion remains concealed. The very high porosity of RAAC is widely suspected to be a major contributing factor. However, current corrosion-induced cracking models are known to struggle with capturing the role of concrete porosity. To remedy this critical deficiency, we propose to enrich corrosion-induced cracking modelling with the analytical solution of reactive transport equations governing the precipitation of rust and a porosity-dependent description of diffusivity. With this, the corrosion concealment in RAAC panels is studied computationally for the first time, revealing that RAAC panels can suddenly collapse before any warning of corrosion-induced surface cracking and allowing to map the conditions most likely to result in sudden collapse.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning, such as Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO), show strong performance when paired with large language models (LLMs). Motivated by this success, we ask whether similar gains can be realized in financial trading. We design a trading agent that combines an improved Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, augmented with ideas from DAPO, with LLM-based risk and sentiment signals extracted from financial news. On the NASDAQ-100 index (FNSPID dataset), our agent attains a cumulative return of 230.49 percent and an information ratio of 0.37, outperforming the CPPO-DeepSeek baseline. It also cuts training time from about 8 hours to 2.5 hours over 100 epochs while markedly reducing RAM usage. The proposed RL-LLM framework offers a scalable path toward data-efficient trading agents. Code: https://github.com/Ruijian-Zha/FinRL-DAPO-SR/

This paper introduces a novel ternary signalling scheme for inductive coupling links (ICLs) in 3D-integrated circuits (3D-ICs) to mitigate crosstalk and electromagnetic interference. By utilizing three voltage levels (-V, 0V, +V) instead of the traditional binary approach, this scheme enhances signal separation, decreases crosstalk, and enhances signal integrity. The ternary system allows for increased bandwidth efficiency and reduced power consumption as compared to Non-Return to Zero (NRZ) systems due to fewer signal transitions. A modified H-Bridge transmitter is used to generate ternary symbols by regulating current flow based on binary-to-ternary mapping. Initial simulations corroborate the effectiveness of the scheme, demonstrating minimized power consumption and higher data rates in comparison with NRZ. This innovative approach presents potential benefits for high-performance computing and Internet of Things (IoT) devices in 3D-IC settings, providing enhanced noise resilience, reduced power consumption, and heightened communication efficiency. <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes a ternary signalling scheme for inductive coupling links (ICLs) in 3D-integrated circuits (3D-ICs) to reduce crosstalk and electromagnetic interference in multi-stacked chip communications. By converting binary data into ternary sequences with three voltage levels (-V, 0V, +V), the approach enhances signal separation, reduces crosstalk, and improves signal integrity. Unlike traditional Non-Return to Zero (NRZ) systems, the ternary scheme increases bandwidth efficiency and reduces power consumption through fewer signal transitions. A modified H-Bridge transmitter generates ternary symbols by controlling current flow based on binary-to-ternary mapping. Preliminary simulations validate the efficiency of the scheme, showing reduced power consumption and higher data rates compared to NRZ. This approach shows promise for high-performance computing and IoT devices in 3D-IC environments, offering enhanced noise resilience, lower power usage, and improved communication efficiency.

<div> framework, EEG, representation, transformer, pretraining
Summary:
The article introduces the Adaptive Large Foundation model for EEG signal representation (ALFEE) framework, which aims to enhance the representation learning for EEG signals. The framework consists of a hybrid transformer architecture with two learning stages. It utilizes a hybrid attention mechanism to separate channel-wise feature aggregation and temporal dynamics modeling, allowing for robust representation of EEG signals with variable channel configurations. ALFEE includes a channel encoder, temporal encoder, and hybrid decoder to optimize task prediction, channel and temporal mask reconstruction, and temporal forecasting during pretraining. The framework also incorporates full-model adaptation during fine-tuning to improve performance across multiple tasks. Experimental results on six downstream EEG tasks demonstrate the superior performance of ALFEE over existing models. The ALFEE framework provides a scalable foundation for biological signal analysis and is available for implementation on GitHub. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: While foundation models excel in text, image, and video domains, the critical biological signals, particularly electroencephalography(EEG), remain underexplored. EEG benefits neurological research with its high temporal resolution, operational practicality, and safety profile. However, low signal-to-noise ratio, inter-subject variability, and cross-paradigm differences hinder the generalization of current models. Existing methods often employ simplified strategies, such as a single loss function or a channel-temporal joint representation module, and suffer from a domain gap between pretraining and evaluation tasks that compromises efficiency and adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose the Adaptive Large Foundation model for EEG signal representation(ALFEE) framework, a novel hybrid transformer architecture with two learning stages for robust EEG representation learning. ALFEE employs a hybrid attention that separates channel-wise feature aggregation from temporal dynamics modeling, enabling robust EEG representation with variable channel configurations. A channel encoder adaptively compresses variable channel information, a temporal encoder captures task-guided evolution, and a hybrid decoder reconstructs signals in both temporal and frequency domains. During pretraining, ALFEE optimizes task prediction, channel and temporal mask reconstruction, and temporal forecasting to enhance multi-scale and multi-channel representation. During fine-tuning, a full-model adaptation with a task-specific token dictionary and a cross-attention layer boosts performance across multiple tasks. After 25,000 hours of pretraining, extensive experimental results on six downstream EEG tasks demonstrate the superior performance of ALFEE over existing models. Our ALFEE framework establishes a scalable foundation for biological signal analysis with implementation at https://github.com/xw1216/ALFEE.

<div> Keywords: Machine Learning, Generative Adversarial Networks, Super Resolution, Physical Consistency, Scientific Applications

<br /><br />Summary: 
Machine Learning, specifically Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has significantly transformed Super Resolution (SR) image techniques. However, existing generated images often lack physical meaningfulness, crucial for scientific applications. The proposed PC-SRGAN addresses this limitation by enhancing image resolution while ensuring physical consistency, leading to interpretable simulations. This approach demonstrates notable improvements in the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and the Structural Similarity Index Measure when compared to traditional methods, even achieving effective results with limited training data (utilizing just 13% of the data required for SRGAN). In addition to SR, PC-SRGAN incorporates physically meaningful machine learning by integrating numerically justified time integrators and advanced quality metrics, aiming for reliable and causal models in scientific fields. A key benefit of PC-SRGAN over conventional SR methods is its physical consistency, positioning it as a viable surrogate model for time-dependent problems. Ultimately, this advancement supports scientific machine learning by enhancing accuracy and efficiency in image processing, improving process understanding, and offering a broader range of applications in scientific research. The source codes and data will be publicly accessible at the provided GitHub link upon paper acceptance. <div>

<div> Keywords: Commodity price volatility, multi-horizon forecasting, Regularized Sparse Autoencoder, interpretable latent drivers, deep learning framework

<br /><br />Summary: This paper addresses the challenges posed by commodity price volatility, emphasizing the need for accurate multi-horizon forecasting. Predicting prices of commodities such as copper and crude oil is complicated by various factors, including macroeconomic indicators, supply and demand dynamics, and geopolitical events. Existing forecasting models often lack transparency, which limits their strategic applications. To tackle this issue, the authors introduce the Regularized Sparse Autoencoder (RSAE), a deep learning framework that facilitates simultaneous forecasting across multiple horizons (e.g., 1-day, 1-week, 1-month) using multivariate time series data. Notably, L1 regularization is applied to the latent vector of the model to enforce sparsity, leading to more parsimonious explanations of underlying market dynamics, including demand and supply shocks. Drawing insights from energy-based models and sparse coding, the RSAE achieves a balance between predictive accuracy and the ability to learn interpretable representations. Furthermore, evaluations on historical data for Copper and Crude Oil indicate that the RSAE not only provides competitive forecasting accuracy but also offers data-driven insights into price dynamics, distinguishing it from traditional black-box forecasting approaches. <div>

Abstract: Commodity price volatility creates economic challenges, necessitating accurate multi-horizon forecasting. Predicting prices for commodities like copper and crude oil is complicated by diverse interacting factors (macroeconomic, supply/demand, geopolitical, etc.). Current models often lack transparency, limiting strategic use. This paper presents a Regularized Sparse Autoencoder (RSAE), a deep learning framework for simultaneous multi-horizon commodity price prediction and discovery of interpretable latent market drivers. The RSAE forecasts prices at multiple horizons (e.g., 1-day, 1-week, 1-month) using multivariate time series. Crucially, L1 regularization ($\|\mathbf{z}\|_1$) on its latent vector $\mathbf{z}$ enforces sparsity, promoting parsimonious explanations of market dynamics through learned factors representing underlying drivers (e.g., demand, supply shocks). Drawing from energy-based models and sparse coding, the RSAE optimizes predictive accuracy while learning sparse representations. Evaluated on historical Copper and Crude Oil data with numerous indicators, our findings indicate the RSAE offers competitive multi-horizon forecasting accuracy and data-driven insights into price dynamics via its interpretable latent space, a key advantage over traditional black-box approaches.

<div> Keywords: Large Language Models, asset pricing, stock trading, backtesting framework, market regime analysis

Summary: 
The study evaluates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in timing-based investment strategies across a broader range of symbols and over a longer timeframe using the FINSABER backtesting framework. Results show that previously reported advantages of LLM strategies diminish significantly when evaluated over two decades and on over 100 symbols. The analysis reveals that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, leading to underperformance against passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, resulting in heavy losses. The study highlights the importance of developing LLM strategies that prioritize trend detection and incorporate regime-aware risk controls rather than solely focusing on complex frameworks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.07078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been leveraged for asset pricing tasks and stock trading applications, enabling AI agents to generate investment decisions from unstructured financial data. However, most evaluations of LLM timing-based investing strategies are conducted on narrow timeframes and limited stock universes, overstating effectiveness due to survivorship and data-snooping biases. We critically assess their generalizability and robustness by proposing FINSABER, a backtesting framework evaluating timing-based strategies across longer periods and a larger universe of symbols. Systematic backtests over two decades and 100+ symbols reveal that previously reported LLM advantages deteriorate significantly under broader cross-section and over a longer-term evaluation. Our market regime analysis further demonstrates that LLM strategies are overly conservative in bull markets, underperforming passive benchmarks, and overly aggressive in bear markets, incurring heavy losses. These findings highlight the need to develop LLM strategies that are able to prioritise trend detection and regime-aware risk controls over mere scaling of framework complexity.

Abstract: This work proposes a method and optimized implementation for exascale simulations of high-speed compressible fluid flows, enabling the simulation of multi-engine rocket craft at an unprecedented scale. We significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art in terms of computational cost and memory footprint through a carefully crafted implementation of the recently proposed information geometric regularization, which eliminates the need for numerical shock capturing. Unified addressing on tightly coupled CPU--GPU platforms increases the total problem size with negligible performance hit. Despite linear stencil algorithms being memory-bound, we achieve wall clock times that are four times faster than optimized baseline numerics. This enables the execution of CFD simulations at more than 100 trillion grid points, surpassing the largest state-of-the-art publicly available simulations by an order of magnitude. Ideal weak scaling is demonstrated on OLCF Frontier and CSCS Alps using the full system, entailing 37.8K AMD MI250X GPUs (Frontier) or 9.2K NVIDIA GH200 superchips (Alps).

The article discusses the development of the Vermouth python library for preparing, running, and analyzing Martini simulations of complex systems. The Martinize2 program, a part of Vermouth, is highlighted for its ability to handle protonation states, post-translation modifications, and structural biases such as the elastic network. It can also convert non-protein molecules like ligands. The Vermouth library addresses the need for automation tools in high-throughput simulations and studies of complex cellular systems.

Abstract: Ongoing advances in force field and computer hardware development enable the use of molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate increasingly complex systems with the ultimate goal of reaching cellular complexity. At the same time, rational design by high-throughput (HT) simulations is another forefront of MD. In these areas, the Martini coarse-grained force field, especially the latest version (i.e. v3), is being actively explored because it offers an enhanced spatial-temporal resolution. However, the automation tools for preparing simulations with the Martini force field, accompanying the previous version, were not designed for HT simulations or studies of complex cellular systems. Therefore, they become a major limiting factor. To address these shortcomings, we present the open-source Vermouth python library. Vermouth is designed to become the unified framework for developing programs, which prepare, run, and analyze Martini simulations of complex systems. To demonstrate the power of the Vermouth library, the Martinize2 program is showcased as a generalization of the martinize script, originally aimed to set up simulations of proteins. In contrast to the previous version, Martinize2 automatically handles protonation states in proteins and post-translation modifications, offers more options to fine-tune structural biases such as the elastic network (EN), and can convert non-protein molecules such as ligands. Finally, Martinize2 is used in two high-complexity benchmarks. The entire I-TASSER protein template database as well as a subset of 200,000 structures from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database are converted to CG resolution and we illustrate how the checks on input structure quality can safeguard high-throughput applications.

<div> Keywords: stock price prediction, deep learning, GRU, long short-term relationships, algorithmic trading  

<br /><br />Summary:  
Stock price prediction is a complex challenge attracting significant attention within finance. Recent advances in deep learning and graph neural networks have emphasized exploring inter-stock relationships. However, most existing models primarily focus on short-term dynamics and tend to neglect the intricate nonlinear characteristics and higher-order interactions in the market. To address this, the paper introduces the LSR-IGRU model, aimed at improving stock price trend predictions. This model constructs a long short-term relationship matrix utilizing secondary industry information for long-term connections and overnight price data for short-term dynamics. The GRU inputs are enhanced at each step to better combine temporal and relationship data, boosting prediction accuracy. Extensive experimentation across various stock market datasets from China and the United States confirms the LSR-IGRU model's superiority over leading baseline models. Additionally, the model has been successfully implemented in a financial company's algorithmic trading system, significantly outperforming other methods in generating cumulative portfolio returns. The research's codebase is publicly available at the provided GitHub link. <div>

Abstract: Stock price prediction is a challenging problem in the field of finance and receives widespread attention. In recent years, with the rapid development of technologies such as deep learning and graph neural networks, more research methods have begun to focus on exploring the interrelationships between stocks. However, existing methods mostly focus on the short-term dynamic relationships of stocks and directly integrating relationship information with temporal information. They often overlook the complex nonlinear dynamic characteristics and potential higher-order interaction relationships among stocks in the stock market. Therefore, we propose a stock price trend prediction model named LSR-IGRU in this paper, which is based on long short-term stock relationships and an improved GRU input. Firstly, we construct a long short-term relationship matrix between stocks, where secondary industry information is employed for the first time to capture long-term relationships of stocks, and overnight price information is utilized to establish short-term relationships. Next, we improve the inputs of the GRU model at each step, enabling the model to more effectively integrate temporal information and long short-term relationship information, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of predicting stock trend changes. Finally, through extensive experiments on multiple datasets from stock markets in China and the United States, we validate the superiority of the proposed LSR-IGRU model over the current state-of-the-art baseline models. We also apply the proposed model to the algorithmic trading system of a financial company, achieving significantly higher cumulative portfolio returns compared to other baseline methods.

This work introduces a novel unfitted finite element framework for simulating surface-bulk problems in time-dependent domains, specifically focusing on fluid-fluid interactions in animal cells. The framework addresses the challenges of modelling cortical contractions that induce surface flows and intracellular flow within large animal cells. By combining the trace finite element method for surface flows with the aggregated finite element method for bulk flows, the framework enables accurate and stable simulations on fixed Cartesian grids without remeshing. Additionally, it incorporates mechanochemical feedback through the surface transport of a molecular regulator of active tension. The method's accuracy and stability are validated through numerical experiments, showcasing its ability to capture phenomena such as self-organized pattern formation, curvature-driven relaxation, and cell cleavage. This innovative framework provides a versatile tool for studying complex morphogenetic processes in animal cells.

Abstract: This work presents a novel unfitted finite element framework to simulate coupled surface-bulk problems in time-dependent domains, focusing on fluid-fluid interactions in animal cells between the actomyosin cortex and the cytoplasm. The cortex, a thin layer beneath the plasma membrane, provides structural integrity and drives shape changes by generating surface contractile forces akin to tension. Cortical contractions generate Marangoni-like surface flows and induce intracellular cytoplasmic flows that are essential for processes such as cell division, migration, and polarization, particularly in large animal cells. Despite its importance, the spatiotemporal regulation of cortex-cytoplasm interactions remains poorly understood and computational modelling can be very challenging because surface-bulk dynamics often lead to large cell deformations. To address these challenges, we propose a sharp-interface framework that uniquely combines the trace finite element method for surface flows with the aggregated finite element method for bulk flows. This approach enables accurate and stable simulations on fixed Cartesian grids without remeshing. The model also incorporates mechanochemical feedback through the surface transport of a molecular regulator of active tension. We solve the resulting mixed-dimensional system on a fixed Cartesian grid using a level-set-based method to track the evolving surface. Numerical experiments validate the accuracy and stability of the method, capturing phenomena such as self-organised pattern formation, curvature-driven relaxation, and cell cleavage. This novel framework offers a powerful and extendable tool for investigating increasingly complex morphogenetic processes in animal cells.

Summary: 
Deep learning models for conversion prediction in online advertising often require complex training to predict multiple objectives. The use of embedding tables encoding high cardinality categorical features can enhance model performance but poses challenges due to gradient sparsity and label sparsity. Pinterest Ads Conversion models utilize Sparse Optimizer to improve convergence speed and address multi-epoch overfitting. The severity of overfitting varies across objectives in a multi-task model based on label sparsity. A new approach using frequency-adaptive learning rates on embedding tables is proposed to mitigate multi-epoch overfitting, compared to re-initialization. Evaluation on a large-scale production dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of these techniques in enhancing model performance without sacrificing accuracy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deep learning for conversion prediction has found widespread applications in online advertising. These models have become more complex as they are trained to jointly predict multiple objectives such as click, add-to-cart, checkout and other conversion types. Additionally, the capacity and performance of these models can often be increased with the use of embedding tables that encode high cardinality categorical features such as advertiser, user, campaign, and product identifiers (IDs). These embedding tables can be pre-trained, but also learned end-to-end jointly with the model to directly optimize the model objectives. Training these large tables is challenging due to: gradient sparsity, the high cardinality of the categorical features, the non-uniform distribution of IDs and the very high label sparsity. These issues make training prone to both slow convergence and overfitting after the first epoch. Previous works addressed the multi-epoch overfitting issue by using: stronger feature hashing to reduce cardinality, filtering of low frequency IDs, regularization of the embedding tables, re-initialization of the embedding tables after each epoch, etc. Some of these techniques reduce overfitting at the expense of reduced model performance if used too aggressively. In this paper, we share key learnings from the development of embedding table optimization and multi-epoch training in Pinterest Ads Conversion models. We showcase how our Sparse Optimizer speeds up convergence, and how multi-epoch overfitting varies in severity between different objectives in a multi-task model depending on label sparsity. We propose a new approach to deal with multi-epoch overfitting: the use of a frequency-adaptive learning rate on the embedding tables and compare it to embedding re-initialization. We evaluate both methods offline using an industrial large-scale production dataset.

Abstract: We characterize the GPU energy usage of two widely adopted exascale-ready applications representing two classes of particle and mesh solvers: (i) QMCPACK, a quantum Monte Carlo package, and (ii) AMReX-Castro, an adaptive mesh astrophysical code. We analyze power, temperature, utilization, and energy traces from double-/single (mixed)-precision benchmarks on NVIDIA's A100 and H100 and AMD's MI250X GPUs using queries in NVML and rocm smi lib, respectively. We explore application-specific metrics to provide insights on energy vs. performance trade-offs. Our results suggest that mixed-precision energy savings range between 6-25% on QMCPACK and 45% on AMReX-Castro. Also there are still gaps in the AMD tooling on Frontier GPUs that need to be understood, while query resolutions on NVML have little variability between 1 ms and 1 s. Overall, application level knowledge is crucial to define energy-cost/science-benefit opportunities for the codesign of future supercomputer architectures in the post-Moore era.

Abstract: High-frequency trading (HFT) is an investing strategy that continuously monitors market states and places bid and ask orders at millisecond speeds. Traditional HFT approaches fit models with historical data and assume that future market states follow similar patterns. This limits the effectiveness of any single model to the specific conditions it was trained for. Additionally, these models achieve optimal solutions only under specific market conditions, such as assumptions about stock price's stochastic process, stable order flow, and the absence of sudden volatility. Real-world markets, however, are dynamic, diverse, and frequently volatile. To address these challenges, we propose the FlowHFT, a novel imitation learning framework based on flow matching policy. FlowHFT simultaneously learns strategies from numerous expert models, each proficient in particular market scenarios. As a result, our framework can adaptively adjust investment decisions according to the prevailing market state. Furthermore, FlowHFT incorporates a grid-search fine-tuning mechanism. This allows it to refine strategies and achieve superior performance even in complex or extreme market scenarios where expert strategies may be suboptimal. We test FlowHFT in multiple market environments. We first show that flow matching policy is applicable in stochastic market environments, thus enabling FlowHFT to learn trading strategies under different market conditions. Notably, our single framework consistently achieves performance superior to the best expert for each market condition.

<div> Keywords: vehicle trajectories, traffic flow maps, measurement noise, local alignment algorithms, spatial resolution

Summary: 
Vehicle trajectories are valuable data for generating traffic flow maps at various scales. However, the presence of measurement noise can make small-scale aggregation challenging. To address this issue, new local alignment algorithms are introduced to align road segments for accurate flow mapping. These algorithms use inferred road segments as reference points and iterate through the process to compute locally aligned flow maps. Testing on synthetic and real-world data shows that the locally aligned maps provide precise flow aggregation at multiple scales, enhancing the accuracy and spatial resolution of static and interactive maps. The innovative approach offers a solution to the noise-related challenges in small-scale flow aggregation, making it possible to generate detailed and reliable traffic flow maps for effective traffic management and planning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2406.17500v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vehicle trajectories, with their detailed geolocations, are a promising data source to compute traffic flow maps at scales ranging from the city/regional level to the road level. The main obstacle is that trajectory data are prone to measurement noise. While this is negligible for city level large-scale flow aggregation, it poses substantial difficulties for road level small-scale aggregation. To overcome these difficulties, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. We deploy these algorithms in an iterative workflow to compute locally aligned flow maps. By applying this workflow to synthetic and empirical trajectories, we verify that our locally aligned flow maps provide high levels of accuracy and spatial resolution of flow aggregation at multiple scales for static and interactive maps.

<title>Physics-informed solution reconstruction in elasticity and heat transfer using the explicit constraint force method</title>

<div> Keywords: physics-informed neural networks, solution reconstruction, interpretability, robustness, explicit constraint force method

<br /><br />Summary: This article addresses the challenges faced by physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in solution reconstruction, which estimates the complete state of a physical system from sparse measurements. A key issue identified is that the governing equations used may not align with the actual physical phenomena, leading to potential failures in fulfilling the criteria of interpretability, robustness, and data consistency. These criteria are essential for assessing reconstruction quality, ensuring that results aren’t overly dependent on the choice of physics loss, and enabling the unique recovery of physics parameters. The study demonstrates that conventional physics loss formulations create varying "constraint forces," which are additional source terms that influence the reconstructed solution. To mitigate these issues, the authors propose an "explicit constraint force method" (ECFM) that provides better control over the introduced source terms. By adhering to the outlined criteria, the ECFM allows for more reliable and customizable reconstructions from noisy data, even when the physics parameterization does not match the measured system accurately. This approach enhances the performance and interpretability of PINNs in practical applications. <div>
arXiv:2505.04875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One use case of ``physics-informed neural networks'' (PINNs) is solution reconstruction, which aims to estimate the full-field state of a physical system from sparse measurements. Parameterized governing equations of the system are used in tandem with the measurements to regularize the regression problem. However, in real-world solution reconstruction problems, the parameterized governing equation may be inconsistent with the physical phenomena that give rise to the measurement data. We show that due to assuming consistency between the true and parameterized physics, PINNs-based approaches may fail to satisfy three basic criteria of interpretability, robustness, and data consistency. As we argue, these criteria ensure that (i) the quality of the reconstruction can be assessed, (ii) the reconstruction does not depend strongly on the choice of physics loss, and (iii) that in certain situations, the physics parameters can be uniquely recovered. In the context of elasticity and heat transfer, we demonstrate how standard formulations of the physics loss and techniques for constraining the solution to respect the measurement data lead to different ``constraint forces" -- which we define as additional source terms arising from the constraints -- and that these constraint forces can significantly influence the reconstructed solution. To avoid the potentially substantial influence of the choice of physics loss and method of constraint enforcement on the reconstructed solution, we propose the ``explicit constraint force method'' (ECFM) to gain control of the source term introduced by the constraint. We then show that by satisfying the criteria of interpretability, robustness, and data consistency, this approach leads to more predictable and customizable reconstructions from noisy measurement data, even when the parameterization of the missing physics is inconsistent with the measured system.

<div> Keywords: shot peen forming, torque, bending equations, Kirchhoff plate, Monte Carlo methods  

<br /><br />Summary: The study explores shot peen forming, a technique where high-velocity steel pellets impact aluminum panels, causing localized plastic deformation. This process enhances the fatigue properties of the material and introduces a residual stress distribution that results in bending, which can be interpreted as the application of spatially varying torques. The authors develop bending equations for a thermally loaded homogeneous Kirchhoff plate to predict the effects of shot peen forming. A novel test method is introduced to extract an equivalent applied torque from the bending response of uniformly shot peened plates, simplifying the accounting for surface plasticity. This extracted torque serves as an input for a model predicting the formation of rectangular plates under varied shot peen conditions. An experimental design is created and executed to assess the model’s validity against actual shot peen operations. Additionally, uncertainty within the experimental results is quantified using Monte Carlo methods, providing insights into the reliability of the findings and the effectiveness of the proposed modeling approach in capturing the influence of shot peening on panel deformation. <div>
arXiv:2505.05236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common technique used in factories to shape metal panels is shot peen forming, where the panel is sprayed with a high-velocity stream of small steel pellets called shot. The impacts between the hard steel shot and softer aluminum panel cause localized plastic deformation, both improving the fatigue properties of the material's surface and imparting a residual stress distribution that results in bending. Thus, a torque is associated with the through-thickness shot peen stress distribution. We conceptualize shot peen forming as the application of spatially varying torques, which are modeled with the input of applied temperatures. In this paper, we derive the bending equations for a thermally loaded homogeneous Kirchhoff plate in order to predict the effects of shot peen forming. A simple test is devised to extract the value of an equivalent applied torque from the bending response of uniformly shot peened plates, which circumvents the difficulty of accounting for surface plasticity. This torque can be used as an input to a model which predicts the shape of rectangular plates under more complicated shot peen conditions. An experiment is designed and carried out which investigates the agreement between the model and real shot peen operations. The effect of uncertainty in the experiment is estimated with Monte Carlo methods.

<div> Keywords: graph-based encoding, multi-modal fusion, Crystal Graph Convolution Network, SciBERT, zero-shot performance

<br /><br />Summary: The paper presents Material Multi-Modal Fusion (MatMMFuse), a novel model that combines graph-based and text-based representations for enhanced material property prediction. By integrating local feature learning from the Crystal Graph Convolution Network (CGCNN) and global information from the SciBERT model, MatMMFuse utilizes a multi-head attention mechanism for effective fusion. The model is trained end-to-end using data from the Materials Project Dataset and demonstrates significant improvements over the individual CGCNN and SciBERT models across key properties: formation energy, band gap, energy above hull, and Fermi energy. Notably, the model shows a 40% enhancement compared to the CGCNN and a 68% improvement over the SciBERT model for predicting formation energy per atom. Furthermore, MatMMFuse exhibits impressive zero-shot performance on specialized datasets, including Perovskites, Chalcogenides, and the Jarvis Dataset, outperforming the standalone CGCNN and SciBERT models. This capability allows researchers to apply the model in industrial settings where obtaining training data can be costly. <div>
arXiv:2505.04634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent progress of using graph based encoding of crystal structures for high throughput material property prediction has been quite successful. However, using a single modality model prevents us from exploiting the advantages of an enhanced features space by combining different representations. Specifically, pre-trained Large language models(LLMs) can encode a large amount of knowledge which is beneficial for training of models. Moreover, the graph encoder is able to learn the local features while the text encoder is able to learn global information such as space group and crystal symmetry. In this work, we propose Material Multi-Modal Fusion(MatMMFuse), a fusion based model which uses a multi-head attention mechanism for the combination of structure aware embedding from the Crystal Graph Convolution Network (CGCNN) and text embeddings from the SciBERT model. We train our model in an end-to-end framework using data from the Materials Project Dataset. We show that our proposed model shows an improvement compared to the vanilla CGCNN and SciBERT model for all four key properties: formation energy, band gap, energy above hull and fermi energy. Specifically, we observe an improvement of 40% compared to the vanilla CGCNN model and 68% compared to the SciBERT model for predicting the formation energy per atom. Importantly, we demonstrate the zero shot performance of the trained model on small curated datasets of Perovskites, Chalcogenides and the Jarvis Dataset. The results show that the proposed model exhibits better zero shot performance than the individual plain vanilla CGCNN and SciBERT model. This enables researchers to deploy the model for specialized industrial applications where collection of training data is prohibitively expensive.

<div> Keywords: elastoplastic, calibration, optimization, Hessian, automatic differentiation  

<br /><br />Summary: This paper introduces a novel method for calibrating material parameters in local elastoplastic constitutive models by framing the calibration as a constrained optimization problem. The evolution equations of the constitutive model at a single material point serve as constraints for this optimization. The aim is to minimize the objective function that measures the discrepancy between predicted stress outcomes from the model and actual experimental data. To enhance the calibration process's efficiency, a new direct-adjoint approach is employed to compute the Hessian of the objective function, which is crucial for implementing second-order optimization techniques. Additionally, automatic differentiation is utilized for calculating both gradient and Hessian values accurately. The paper includes two numerical examples to validate the accuracy of the Hessian matrices. The results demonstrate that the Newton-Raphson algorithm significantly outperforms first-order gradient-based methods such as L-BFGS-B in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, confirming the advantages of the proposed calibration approach for elastoplastic models. <div>

<div> Keywords: data assimilation, generative AI, Conjugate Transform Filter, nonlinear estimation, Earth system models  

<br /><br />Summary: The article discusses the limitations of traditional data assimilation (DA) methods in geosciences, which often rely on Gaussian assumptions that can lead to analysis biases and poor forecasts. To address these challenges, the authors introduce a novel nonlinear estimation theory inspired by advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI). They present the Conjugate Transform Filter (CTF), which generalizes the Kalman filter to accommodate non-Gaussian distributions. This new filter is designed to maintain statistical relationships in prior states and effectively converge to accurate observations. Additionally, the article introduces an ensemble approximation of the CTF, termed the Ensemble Conjugate Transform Filter (ECTF), which is validated through idealized statistical experiments involving bounded quantities with non-Gaussian distributions—common in Earth system models. The findings indicate that ECTF performs optimally when observation errors are minor compared to forecast uncertainties and when there are strong nonlinear dependencies among state variables. Ultimately, this new filtering theory presents promising pathways for enhancing conventional DA methods by integrating them with principles from AI, paving the way for improved accuracy in data assimilation tasks in geosciences. <div>

Abstract: The majority of data assimilation (DA) methods in the geosciences are based on Gaussian assumptions. While these assumptions facilitate efficient algorithms, they cause analysis biases and subsequent forecast degradations. Non-parametric, particle-based DA algorithms have superior accuracy, but their application to high-dimensional models still poses operational challenges. Drawing inspiration from recent advances in the field of generative artificial intelligence (AI), this article introduces a new nonlinear estimation theory which attempts to bridge the existing gap in DA methodology. Specifically, a Conjugate Transform Filter (CTF) is derived and shown to generalize the celebrated Kalman filter to arbitrarily non-Gaussian distributions. The new filter has several desirable properties, such as its ability to preserve statistical relationships in the prior state and convergence to highly accurate observations. An ensemble approximation of the new theory (ECTF) is also presented and validated using idealized statistical experiments that feature bounded quantities with non-Gaussian distributions, a prevalent challenge in Earth system models. Results from these experiments indicate that the greatest benefits from ECTF occur when observation errors are small relative to the forecast uncertainty and when state variables exhibit strong nonlinear dependencies. Ultimately, the new filtering theory offers exciting avenues for improving conventional DA algorithms through their principled integration with AI techniques.

<div> Keywords: conveyor belts, anomaly detection, pattern recognition, machine learning, mining operations  

<br /><br />Summary: Conveyor belts play a vital role in mining operations by facilitating the efficient movement of bulk materials, thereby enhancing productivity. While previous studies have focused on detecting anomalies in specific conveyor components, understanding root causes such as production changes and operator errors is essential. Continuous monitoring of conveyor belt work cycles remains nascent, requiring robust solutions. This study introduces two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles, based on a recently proposed anomaly detection technique. The methods utilize threshold-based detection, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models, including decision tree and random forest, among others. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that both proposed methods outperform the existing technique on two datasets. The heuristic rule-based method excels on training dataset with performance metrics of 97.3% for normal and 80.2% for abnormal cycles, while the ML-based approach scores 91.3% and 67.9% respectively on a dataset influenced by machine aging. Implemented on low-power microcontrollers, the methods achieve real-time operation with energy consumption of just 13.3 and 20.6 μJ during inference, presenting a significant advancement in conveyor belt monitoring solutions. <div>

Abstract: Conveyor belts are crucial in mining operations by enabling the continuous and efficient movement of bulk materials over long distances, which directly impacts productivity. While detecting anomalies in specific conveyor belt components has been widely studied, identifying the root causes of these failures, such as changing production conditions and operator errors, remains critical. Continuous monitoring of mining conveyor belt work cycles is still at an early stage and requires robust solutions. Recently, an anomaly detection method for duty cycle operations of a mining conveyor belt has been proposed. Based on its limited performance and unevaluated long-term proper operation, this study proposes two novel methods for classifying normal and abnormal duty cycles. The proposed approaches are pattern recognition systems that make use of threshold-based duty-cycle detection mechanisms, manually extracted features, pattern-matching, and supervised tiny machine learning models. The explored low-computational models include decision tree, random forest, extra trees, extreme gradient boosting, Gaussian naive Bayes, and multi-layer perceptron. A comprehensive evaluation of the former and proposed approaches is carried out on two datasets. Both proposed methods outperform the former method, with the best-performing approach being dataset-dependent. The heuristic rule-based approach achieves the highest performance in the same dataset used for algorithm training, with 97.3% for normal cycles and 80.2% for abnormal cycles. The ML-based approach performs better on a dataset including the effects of machine aging, scoring 91.3% for normal cycles and 67.9% for abnormal cycles. Implemented on two low-power microcontrollers, the methods demonstrate efficient, real-time operation with energy consumption of 13.3 and 20.6 ${\mu}$J during inference.

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel deep learning framework that combines graph neural networks, transformers, and a physics-informed loss function for modal identification in a population of structures. The transformer module breaks down multiple degrees-of-freedom measurements into single-degree-of-freedom modal responses, aiding in the identification of natural frequencies and damping ratios. Concurrently, the graph neural network captures structural configurations and identifies mode shapes corresponding to the decomposed modal responses. The model is trained in an unsupervised manner, utilizing modal decomposition theory and the independence of structural modes for guidance without labeled data. Validation through simulations and experiments shows its ability to accurately decompose dynamic responses and identify modal properties from sparse measurements, even with external load and structural variations. Comparative analyses against existing techniques highlight its superior performance, making it an attractive option for population-based structural health monitoring.

Abstract: Modal identification is crucial for structural health monitoring and structural control, providing critical insights into structural dynamics and performance. This study presents a novel deep learning framework that integrates graph neural networks (GNNs), transformers, and a physics-informed loss function to achieve modal decomposition and identification across a population of structures. The transformer module decomposes multi-degrees-of-freedom (MDOF) structural dynamic measurements into single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) modal responses, facilitating the identification of natural frequencies and damping ratios. Concurrently, the GNN captures the structural configurations and identifies mode shapes corresponding to the decomposed SDOF modal responses. The proposed model is trained in a purely physics-informed and unsupervised manner, leveraging modal decomposition theory and the independence of structural modes to guide learning without the need for labeled data. Validation through numerical simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrates its effectiveness in accurately decomposing dynamic responses and identifying modal properties from sparse structural dynamic measurements, regardless of variations in external loads or structural configurations. Comparative analyses against established modal identification techniques and model variations further underscore its superior performance, positioning it as a favorable approach for population-based structural health monitoring.

<div> Topology optimization, yield stress, local buckling, global buckling, multiscale analysis
<br />
Summary: 
This study introduces an extension of multiscale topology optimization by incorporating yield stress and local/global buckling considerations into the design process. The new framework integrates yield stress limits as constraints or objectives alongside existing buckling constraints, refining the optimization process to meet mechanical performance criteria and material yield constraints. Local density-dependent yield surfaces are established based on local yield estimates, then combined with buckling criteria to obtain topology optimized designs considering yield and buckling failure. This integration is crucial for ensuring structural integrity and durability in real-world scenarios. Numerical examples show that optimized designs are influenced by the stiffness to yield ratio of the building material. Despite the assumption of scale separation, de-homogenized structures closely match homogenized predictions even at coarse length scales.

Abstract: This study presents an extension of multiscale topology optimization by integrating both yield stress and local/global buckling considerations into the design process. Building upon established multiscale methodologies, we develop a new framework incorporating yield stress limits either as constraints or objectives alongside previously established local and global buckling constraints. This approach significantly refines the optimization process, ensuring that the resulting designs meet mechanical performance criteria and adhere to critical material yield constraints. First, we establish local density-dependent von Mises yield surfaces based on local yield estimates from homogenization-based analysis to predict the local yield limits of the homogenized materials. Then, these local Yield-based Load Factors (YLFs) are combined with local and global buckling criteria to obtain topology optimized designs that consider yield and buckling failure on all levels. This integration is crucial for the practical application of optimized structures in real-world scenarios, where material yield and stability behavior critically influence structural integrity and durability. Numerical examples demonstrate how optimized designs depend on the stiffness to yield ratio of the considered building material. Despite the foundational assumption of separation of scales, the de-homogenized structures, even at relatively coarse length scales, exhibit a high degree of agreement with the corresponding homogenized predictions.

<div> Privacy-Preserving Truth Discovery Mobile Crowdsensing Reputation Data Quality<br />
<br />
Summary: The article introduces a Reputation and Data Privacy-Preserving-based Truth Discovery (RDPP-TD) scheme to enhance data quality in mobile crowdsensing (MCS). Existing truth discovery methods often result in low data quality as they only consider current-round data. The proposed RDPP-TD scheme integrates Reputation-based Truth Discovery (RTD) with a Reputation and Data Privacy-Preserving (RDPP) approach to estimate truth more accurately and ensure privacy protection for worker data and reputation values. By combining RTD with RDPP, the scheme evaluates worker reliability in a privacy-preserving manner and supports reputation-based worker recruitment and rewards. The comprehensive theoretical analysis and experiments show that RDPP-TD improves data quality by up to 33.3% while providing strong privacy protection in MCS. <div>

Abstract: Truth discovery (TD) plays an important role in Mobile Crowdsensing (MCS). However, existing TD methods, including privacy-preserving TD approaches, estimate the truth by weighting only the data submitted in the current round, which often results in low data quality. Moreover, there is a lack of effective TD methods that preserve both reputation and data privacy. To address these issues, a Reputation and Data Privacy-Preserving based Truth Discovery (RDPP-TD) scheme is proposed to obtain high-quality data for MCS. The RDPP-TD scheme consists of two key approaches: a Reputation-based Truth Discovery (RTD) approach, which integrates the weight of current-round data with workers' reputation values to estimate the truth, thereby achieving more accurate results, and a Reputation and Data Privacy-Preserving (RDPP) approach, which ensures privacy preservation for sensing data and reputation values. First, the RDPP approach, when seamlessly integrated with RTD, can effectively evaluate the reliability of workers and their sensing data in a privacy-preserving manner. Second, the RDPP scheme supports reputation-based worker recruitment and rewards, ensuring high-quality data collection while incentivizing workers to provide accurate information. Comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed RDPP-TD scheme provides strong privacy protection and improves data quality by up to 33.3%.

<div> auctions, decentralized exchanges, solver-based protocols, execution welfare, liquidity profile

Summary:
Solver-based protocols in decentralized exchanges have shown to improve execution welfare for end users compared to traditional routing methods like Uniswap V2 or V3. The study analyzed data for different asset pairs (USDC-WETH and PEPE-WETH) and found that solver-based platforms such as CoWSwap, 1inchFusion, and UniswapX, offer varying levels of execution welfare. While USDC-WETH, a short-tail asset, benefited significantly from solver-based trading, the impact was less pronounced for PEPE-WETH, a long-tail asset. The study also highlighted potential inefficiencies in solver market structure, liquidity profiles, and competition dynamics among solvers. These insights underscore the advantages of solver-based protocols in improving execution outcomes but also raise concerns about market concentration and competition dynamics in decentralized exchanges. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2503.00738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized exchanges (DEXes) have evolved dramatically since the introduction of Automated Market Makers (AMMs). In recent years, solver-based protocols have emerged as an alternative venue aiming to introduce competition for routing, access to offchain liquidity, and thereby improve end-user execution. Currently, these solver auctions are hosted on opaque backends, and the extent of price improvement they provide to end users remains unclear.
  We conduct an empirical study of the execution welfare that these protocols bring to users by analyzing data across different asset profiles (USDC-WETH and PEPE-WETH). Our results indicate that, compared to vanilla routing through Uniswap V2 or V3, solver-based protocols effectively enhance execution welfare for end users on DEXes within certain trade size ranges. This effect is most pronounced with USDC-WETH, a short-tail asset, and somewhat less significant with PEPE-WETH, a long-tail asset.
  Additionally, we identify execution welfare discrepancies across solver-based platforms (e.g., CoWSwap, 1inchFusion, UniswapX), revealing potential inefficiencies due to solver market structure, variations in liquidity profile and inventory depth among solvers. These insights highlight both the advantages and challenges of solver-based trading, underscoring its role in improving execution outcomes while raising concerns about market concentration and competition dynamics.

<br />
Summary: 
Auto$.$gov is a novel governance framework for decentralized finance (DeFi) that utilizes deep Q-network reinforcement learning to automate parameter adjustments. Traditional DeFi governance methods are manual and prone to human bias and financial risks. Auto$.$gov addresses these issues by using RL to make data-driven decisions and adapt to market conditions. In simulated tests based on the Aave lending protocol, Auto$.$gov successfully prevented funds loss from price oracle attacks. Real-world tests showed that Auto$.$gov outperformed benchmark approaches by 14% and the static baseline model by tenfold in terms of protocol profitability. This innovative governance model enhances the security, profitability, and sustainability of DeFi protocols, offering a more efficient and effective alternative to traditional governance methods.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2302.09551v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an integral component of the blockchain ecosystem, enabling a range of financial activities through smart-contract-based protocols. Traditional DeFi governance typically involves manual parameter adjustments by protocol teams or token holder votes, and is thus prone to human bias and financial risks, undermining the system's integrity and security. While existing efforts aim to establish more adaptive parameter adjustment schemes, there remains a need for a governance model that is both more efficient and resilient to significant market manipulations. In this paper, we introduce "Auto$.$gov", a learning-based governance framework that employs a deep Qnetwork (DQN) reinforcement learning (RL) strategy to perform semi-automated, data-driven parameter adjustments. We create a DeFi environment with an encoded action-state space akin to the Aave lending protocol for simulation and testing purposes, where Auto$.$gov has demonstrated the capability to retain funds that would have otherwise been lost to price oracle attacks. In tests with real-world data, Auto$.$gov outperforms the benchmark approaches by at least 14% and the static baseline model by tenfold, in terms of the preset performance metric--protocol profitability. Overall, the comprehensive evaluations confirm that Auto$.$gov is more efficient and effective than traditional governance methods, thereby enhancing the security, profitability, and ultimately, the sustainability of DeFi protocols.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel framework for simulating the growth of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) tumors using a Cellular Potts Model (CPM) coupled with partial differential equations (PDEs). A dynamic bounding box is applied to the simulation domain, based on CT scan data, to reduce memory and CPU overhead. This adaptive partitioning allows for efficient use of computational resources by reducing the 3D domain over which the PDEs are solved. The PDEs, representing oxygen, nutrients, and cytokines, are solved using the finite-volume method with a first-order implicit Euler scheme. Parallelization is achieved using mpi4py library, LinearGMRESSolver, and PETSc for efficient convergence. Parallel computation results in reduced solving time compared to serial computation, with optimizations enhancing memory usage and load balancing among cores. <div>

Abstract: A novel parallel efficiency analysis on a framework for simulating the growth of Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma (MPM) tumours is presented. Proliferation of MPM tumours in the pleural space is simulated using a Cellular Potts Model (CPM) coupled with partial differential equations (PDEs). Using segmented lung data from CT scans, an environment is set up with artificial tumour data in the pleural space, representing the simulation domain, onto which a dynamic bounding box is applied to restrict computations to the region of interest, dramatically reducing memory and CPU overhead. This adaptive partitioning of the domain enables efficient use of computational resources by reducing the three-dimensional (3D) domain over which the PDEs are to be solved. The PDEs, representing oxygen, nutrients, and cytokines, are solved using the finite-volume method with a first-order implicit Euler scheme. Parallelization is realized using the public Python library mpi4py in combination with LinearGMRESSolver and PETSc for efficient convergence. Performance analyses have shown that parallelization achieves a reduced solving time compared to serial computation. Also, optimizations enable efficient use of available memory and improved load balancing amongst the cores.

Summary:
The study focuses on predicting and forecasting solar PV power output using a transformer architecture and fully-connected layer. The research addresses the challenge of uncertainty in solar PV output due to weather conditions like cloud cover, which can vary over short and long timescales. By utilizing one year of image data and experimenting with different learning rates and batch sizes, the transformer architecture shows promising results in predicting PV output. However, it performs less effectively on days with clear skies compared to the baseline model. Reliable forecasts of renewable energy generation are vital for electricity market balance and supply reliability. This research contributes to improving the accuracy of solar PV power output predictions, particularly in the context of fluctuating weather conditions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable forecasts of the power output from variable renewable energy generators like solar photovoltaic systems are important to balancing load on real-time electricity markets and ensuring electricity supply reliability. However, solar PV power output is highly uncertain, with significant variations occurring over both longer (daily or seasonally) and shorter (within minutes) timescales due to weather conditions, especially cloud cover. This paper builds on existing work that uses convolutional neural networks in the computer vision task of predicting (in a Nowcast model) and forecasting (in a Forecast model) solar PV power output (Stanford EAO SUNSET Model). A pure transformer architecture followed by a fully-connected layer is applied to one year of image data with experiments run on various combinations of learning rate and batch size. We find that the transformer architecture performs almost as well as the baseline model in the PV output prediction task. However, it performs worse on sunny days.

<br />
Summary:
This study introduces a data-efficient and accurate surrogate model for spinodoid metamaterials' structure-property linkages, using only 75 data points, a substantial reduction compared to previous works. By employing a neural network-based surrogate model that satisfies specific requirements such as equivariance with respect to permutations of structure parameters, the research team successfully creates a differentiable surrogate of the forward model. This model enables gradient-based optimization for inverse design problems, demonstrating reliable results in various complex tasks. The data efficiency achieved in this study opens up possibilities for inverse design applications involving nonlinear mechanical behavior, where the limitation of data availability has been a challenge. <div>
arXiv:2505.03415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We create an data-efficient and accurate surrogate model for structure-property linkages of spinodoid metamaterials with only 75 data points -- far fewer than the several thousands used in prior works -- and demonstrate its use in multi-objective inverse design. The inverse problem of finding a material microstructure that leads to given bulk properties is of great interest in mechanics and materials science. These inverse design tasks often require a large dataset, which can become unaffordable when considering material behavior that requires more expensive simulations or experiments. We generate a data-efficient surrogate for the mapping between the characteristics of the local material structure and the effective elasticity tensor and use it to inversely design structures with multiple objectives simultaneously. The presented neural network-based surrogate model achieves its data efficiency by inherently satisfying certain requirements, such as equivariance with respect to permutations of structure parameters, which avoids having to learn them from data. The resulting surrogate of the forward model is differentiable, allowing its direct use in gradient-based optimization for the inverse design problem. We demonstrate in three inverse design tasks of varying complexity that this approach yields reliable results while requiring significantly less training data than previous approaches based on neural-network surrogates. This paves the way for inverse design involving nonlinear mechanical behavior, where data efficiency is currently the limiting factor.

Summary:
Three algorithm selection strategies for Molecular Dynamics simulations were investigated in this work: performance prediction using past data, fuzzy logic-based expert knowledge approach, and data-driven random forest approach. These strategies achieved speedups of up to 4.05 compared to previous methods and 1.25 compared to a static algorithm configuration selection. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of dynamic algorithm selection in improving simulation performance. The practicality of the strategies was also discussed in relation to their performance, emphasizing the feasibility of implementing such solutions in real-world scenarios. Overall, the research showcased the benefits of dynamic algorithm selection in enhancing the efficiency of particle simulations, offering significant speed improvements while maintaining practicality and ease of implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.03438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous algorithms and parallelisations have been developed for short-range particle simulations; however, none are optimally performant for all scenarios. Such a concept led to the prior development of the particle simulation library AutoPas, which implemented many of these algorithms and parallelisations and could select and tune these over the course of the simulation as the scenario changed. Prior works have, however, used only naive approaches to the algorithm selection problem, which can lead to significant overhead from trialling poorly performing algorithmic configurations.
  In this work, we investigate this problem in the case of Molecular Dynamics simulations. We present three algorithm selection strategies: an approach which makes performance predictions from past data, an expert-knowledge fuzzy logic-based approach, and a data-driven random forest-based approach. We demonstrate that these approaches can achieve speedups of up to 4.05 compared to prior approaches and 1.25 compared to a perfect configuration selection without dynamic algorithm selection. In addition, we discuss the practicality of the strategies in comparison to their performance, to highlight the tractability of such solutions.

Summary: The article presents simulation-based equations for calculating propagation constants in uniform or periodic structures using a Field Propagation Parameter Splitter (FPPS) model. The FPPS model is based on field distributions obtained from a driven-mode solver, allowing for the separation of forward and backward waves within structures. The FPPS is tested on various structures including waveguides, closed structures, and open radiation structures, showing its ease of use and adaptability compared to other methods. The model's effectiveness is verified through comparisons with eigenmode solvers, equivalent network methods, and spectral domain integral equation methods. The FPPS can also be applied to open radiating structures and multi-dimensional periodic/uniform structures. <div>

Abstract: In this work, simulation-based equations to calculate propagation constant in uniform or periodic structures (SES) are deduced and verified through simulations in various types of structures. The modeling of those structures are essentially based on field distributions from a driven-mode solver, and the field distributions are used as the input parameters of the FPPS. It allows the separation of forward and backward waves from a total wave inside such a uniform or periodic structure, and thus it can be used to calculate the propagation constants inside both uniform and periodic structures even with a strong reflection. In order to test the performance and function of the FPPS, it has been applied to a variety of typical structures, including uniform waveguides, lossfree closed structures, lossy closed structures, and open radiation structures, and compared with the results of eigenmode solvers, equivalent network methods, and spectral domain integral equation methods. The comparison shows the easy-to-use and adaptable nature of the FPPS. the FPPS. This FPPS could be also applied to open radiating structures, and even multi-dimensional periodic/uniform structures.

Summary: 
This study presents a surrogate model based on a dimensionless back-propagation neural network (BPNN) to predict form errors in glass thermoforming processes. Traditional trial-and-error methods can be time-consuming and costly, leading to inefficiencies in precision glass product development. The surrogate model uses geometric features and process parameters as inputs to accurately predict forming errors, allowing for adjustments in mold design. The model was tested using simulation and industrial data, showing promising results in predicting form errors with reasonable accuracy. Despite potential discrepancies in industrial training data due to perception errors and mold fabrication errors, the surrogate model demonstrated practicality for implementation in the glass-manufacturing industry. <div>
arXiv:2411.06762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many glass products require thermoformed geometry with high precision. However, the traditional approach of developing a thermoforming process through trials and errors can cause large waste of time and resources and often end up with unsuccessfulness. Hence, there is a need to develop an efficient predictive model, replacing the costly simulations or experiments, to assist the design of precision glass thermoforming. In this work, we report a surrogate model, based on a dimensionless back-propagation neural network (BPNN), that can adequately predict the form errors and thus compensate for these errors in mold design using geometric features and process parameters as inputs. Our trials with simulation and industrial data indicate that the surrogate model can predict forming errors with adequate accuracy. Although perception errors (mold designers' decisions) and mold fabrication errors make the industrial training data less reliable than simulation data, our preliminary training and testing results still achieved a reasonable consistency with industrial data, suggesting that the surrogate models are directly implementable in the glass-manufacturing industry.

Summary:This paper investigates the impact of text-derived, time-varying sentiment factors on stock returns using FinBERT. Through a comprehensive study covering 2020-2022, a dynamic sentiment index and its volatility are constructed from financial news and social media data. Results show that sentiment positively influences returns in normal market conditions but its effect varies under extreme volatility. The study reveals the time-varying nature of sentiment sensitivity and demonstrates improved abnormal returns prediction during the Federal Reserve rate hike event in June 15, 2022, using a sentiment-augmented five-factor model. These findings advocate for the integration of high-frequency sentiment analysis in traditional asset pricing models, offering valuable insights for investors and regulators.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study on the integration of text-derived, time-varying sentiment factors into traditional multi-factor asset pricing models. Leveraging FinBERT, a domain-specific deep learning language model, we construct a dynamic sentiment index and its volatility from large-scale financial news and social media data covering 2020 to 2022. By embedding these sentiment measures into the Fama French five-factor regression, we rigorously examine whether sentiment significantly explains variations in daily stock returns and how its impact evolves across different market volatility regimes. Empirical results demonstrate that sentiment has a consistently positive impact on returns during normal periods, while its effect is amplified or even reversed under extreme market conditions. Rolling regressions reveal the time-varying nature of sentiment sensitivity, and an event study around the June 15, 2022 Federal Reserve 75 basis point rate hike shows that a sentiment-augmented five-factor model better explains abnormal returns relative to the baseline model. Our findings support the incorporation of high-frequency, NLP-derived sentiment into classical asset pricing frameworks and suggest implications for investors and regulators.

Abstract: Multivariate Statistical Process Control (MSPC) is a framework for monitoring and diagnosing complex processes by analysing the relationships between multiple process variables simultaneously. Kernel MSPC extends the methodology by leveraging kernel functions to capture non-linear relationships between the data, enhancing the process monitoring capabilities. However, optimising the kernel MSPC parameters, such as the kernel type and kernel parameters, is often done in literature in time-consuming and non-procedural manners such as cross-validation or grid search. In the present paper, we propose optimising the kernel MSPC parameters with Kernel Flows (KF), a recent kernel learning methodology introduced for Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). Apart from the optimisation technique, the novelty of the study resides also in the utilisation of kernel combinations for learning the optimal kernel type, and introduces individual kernel parameters for each variable. The proposed methodology is evaluated with multiple cases from the benchmark Tennessee Eastman Process. The faults are detected for all evaluated cases, including the ones not detected in the original study.

Summary:
The traditional Mean-Variance model is limited by sensitivity to input parameters and lack of flexibility. In contrast, the Black-Litterman model combines market equilibrium returns with investors' subjective views, showing promise in asset price prediction. A novel hybrid deep learning model incorporating Singular Spectrum analysis, Multivariate Aligned Empirical Mode Decomposition, and Temporal Convolutional Networks is proposed to enhance prediction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate noise reduction preprocessing improves model performance significantly. The hybrid model outperforms three benchmark models in multivariate decomposition. An investment portfolio constructed using 20 NASDAQ 100 index stocks shows that when combined with the Black-Litterman model, the hybrid forecasting model produces better returns and risk control capabilities than Mean-Variance, Equal-Weighted, and Market-Weighted models over a short holding period.

Abstract: The sensitivity to input parameters and lack of flexibility limits the traditional Mean-Variance model. In contrast, the Black-Litterman model has attracted widespread attention by integrating market equilibrium returns with investors' subjective views. This paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning model combining Singular Spectrum analysis (SSA), Multivariate Aligned Empirical Mode Decomposition (MA-EMD), and Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), aiming to improve the prediction accuracy of asset prices and thus enhance the ability of the Black-Litterman model to generate subjective views. Experimental results show that noise reduction pre-processing can improve the model's accuracy, and the prediction performance of the proposed model is significantly better than that of three multivariate decomposition benchmark models. We construct an investment portfolio by using 20 representative stocks from the NASDAQ 100 index. By combining the hybrid forecasting model with the Black-Litterman model, the generated investment portfolio exhibits better returns and risk control capabilities than the Mean-Variance, Equal-Weighted, and Market-Weighted models in the short holding period.

<div> Keywords: surface roughness, fatigue life, phase field model, stochastic nature, failure strength <br />
Summary: Surface roughness significantly affects the fatigue life of structural components and can be quantified using the surface factor. A numerical framework based on the phase field method has been developed to estimate the surface factor considering the stochastic nature of roughness. The model's validity is confirmed through experimental data validation. The study explores the impact of key parameters on the fatigue life of rough surfaces, including surface topology and failure strength. Notably, an increase in average surface roughness coupled with a decrease in the correlation length of the surface profile results in a pronounced effect on fatigue life. This effect is more prominent at higher failure strengths. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Surface roughness is a critical factor influencing the fatigue life of structural components. Its effect is commonly quantified using a correction coefficient known as the surface factor. In this paper, a phase field based numerical framework is proposed to estimate the surface factor while accounting for the stochastic nature of surface roughness. The model is validated against existing experimental data. Furthermore, we investigate the influence of key parameters on the fatigue life of rough surfaces, such as surface topology and failure strength. An important effect of surface roughness is observed when the average surface roughness increases and the correlation length of the surface profile decreases. This effect becomes more pronounced with higher failure strengths.

<div> deep learning, electromagnetic scattering, incomplete profile, limited scattering data, forward and inverse problems

Summary:
A new deep learning scheme is proposed to solve electromagnetic scattering problems where the profile of the dielectric scatterer is incomplete. The scheme utilizes a limited amount of scattering data to compensate for the missing profile information. Existing solvers struggle to handle this situation effectively. The proposed scheme addresses this challenge by simultaneously solving the forward and inverse scattering problems. By using deep learning, the EM forward scattering from an incompletely known dielectric scatterer is derived, and numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the scheme's performance for both 2-D and 3-D EM scattering problems. The results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed deep learning-based approach in recovering the unknown parts of the scatterer profile accurately. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.02086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep learning scheme is proposed to solve the electromagnetic (EM) scattering problems where the profile of the dielectric scatterer of interest is incomplete. As a compensation, a limited amount of scattering data is provided, which is in principle containing sufficient information associated with the missing part of the profile. The existing solvers can hardly realize the compensation if the known part of the profile and the scattering data are combined straightforwardly. On one hand, the well-developed forward solvers have no mechanism to accept the scattering data, which can recover the unknown part of the profile if properly used. On the other hand, the existing solvers for inverse problems cannot retrieve the complete profile with an acceptable accuracy from the limited amount of scattering data, even when the available part of the profile can be fed into the solvers. This work aims to handle the difficulty. To this end, the EM forward scattering from an incompletely known dielectric scatterer is derived. A scheme based on DL is then proposed where the forward and inverse scattering problems are solved simultaneously. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the proposed DL-based scheme for both two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) EM scattering problems.

Summary: 
Obtaining reliable permeability maps for oil reservoirs is essential for accurate reservoir simulation models and recovery strategies. Existing methods face challenges due to the integration of various data sources and lack of direct inter-well space information. This study proposes a novel data-fusion approach to predict two-dimensional permeability maps across the entire reservoir area. Utilizing non-parametric regression with a customized kernel shape, incorporating well logs, tests, and seismic data. A convolutional neural network processes seismic data and integrates it with other sources using a multi-stage fusion procedure to enhance the training dataset and construct the permeability map. Testing on a real oil reservoir in Western Siberia shows the developed map aligns with well permeability estimations and significantly improves inter-well space permeability predictions through seismic data integration. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Obtaining reliable permeability maps of oil reservoirs is crucial for building a robust and accurate reservoir simulation model and, therefore, designing effective recovery strategies. This problem, however, remains challenging, as it requires the integration of various data sources by experts from different disciplines. Moreover, there are no sources to provide direct information about the inter-well space. In this work, a new method based on the data-fusion approach is proposed for predicting two-dimensional permeability maps on the whole reservoir area. This method utilizes non-parametric regression with a custom kernel shape accounting for different data sources: well logs, well tests, and seismics. A convolutional neural network is developed to process seismic data and then incorporate it with other sources. A multi-stage data fusion procedure helps to artificially increase the training dataset for the seismic interpretation model and finally to construct the adequate permeability map. The proposed methodology of permeability map construction from different sources was tested on a real oil reservoir located in Western Siberia. The results demonstrate that the developed map perfectly corresponds to the permeability estimations in the wells, and the inter-well space permeability predictions are considerably improved through the incorporation of the seismic data.

Abstract: Predicting the dynamics of complex systems is crucial for various scientific and engineering applications. The accuracy of predictions depends on the model's ability to capture the intrinsic dynamics. While existing methods capture key dynamics by encoding a low-dimensional latent space, they overlook the inherent multiscale structure of complex systems, making it difficult to accurately predict complex spatiotemporal evolution. Therefore, we propose a Multiscale Diffusion Prediction Network (MDPNet) that leverages the multiscale structure of complex systems to discover the latent space of intrinsic dynamics. First, we encode multiscale features through a multiscale diffusion autoencoder to guide the diffusion model for reliable reconstruction. Then, we introduce an attention-based graph neural ordinary differential equation to model the co-evolution across different scales. Extensive evaluations on representative systems demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average prediction error reduction of 53.23% compared to baselines, while also exhibiting superior robustness and generalization.

Summary: <br />
Efficient time series forecasting is crucial for smart energy systems, but the increasing amount of high-frequency data poses storage and transmission challenges. This study investigates the use of Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)-based data compression to address these challenges while maintaining forecasting accuracy. By applying biorthogonal wavelets at different compression rates, the study evaluates the impact on three forecasting models: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), XGBoost, and Time Series Dense Encoder (TiDE). Results show that XGBoost is robust to compression artifacts, while OLS is sensitive to smooth wavelets and high compression rates. TiDE demonstrates some variability but remains competitive. The study suggests that wavelet-based compression can efficiently manage data in smart energy systems without compromising forecasting accuracy, with potential applications in climate modeling, water supply systems, and industrial operations. <div>

Abstract: Efficient time series forecasting is essential for smart energy systems, enabling accurate predictions of energy demand, renewable resource availability, and grid stability. However, the growing volume of high-frequency data from sensors and IoT devices poses challenges for storage and transmission. This study explores Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)-based data compression as a solution to these challenges while ensuring forecasting accuracy. A case study of a seawater supply system in Hirtshals, Denmark, operating under dynamic weather, operational schedules, and seasonal trends, is used for evaluation.
  Biorthogonal wavelets of varying orders were applied to compress data at different rates. Three forecasting models - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), XGBoost, and the Time Series Dense Encoder (TiDE) - were tested to assess the impact of compression on forecasting performance. Lossy compression rates up to $r_{\mathrm{lossy}} = 0.999$ were analyzed, with the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) metric quantifying the relationship between compression and information retention. Results indicate that wavelet-based compression can retain essential features for accurate forecasting when applied carefully.
  XGBoost proved highly robust to compression artifacts, maintaining stable performance across diverse compression rates. In contrast, OLS demonstrated sensitivity to smooth wavelets and high compression rates, while TiDE showed some variability but remained competitive. This study highlights the potential of wavelet-based compression for scalable, efficient data management in smart energy systems without sacrificing forecasting accuracy. The findings are relevant to other fields requiring high-frequency time series forecasting, including climate modeling, water supply systems, and industrial operations.

Summary: <br />
The study introduces a novel framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated classification of mechanical assembly parts' functions in the conceptual design phase of product development. Functional modeling, a critical aspect of early-phase engineering, is often hindered by the lack of structured functional data. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in addressing this gap by automating function annotation through domain adaptation (DA) using fine-tuning. The study showcases the effectiveness of fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo on data from the Oregon State Design Repository (OSDR) to enhance the semantic representation of mechanical parts. Evaluation on the A Big CAD (ABC) dataset demonstrates that domain-adapted LLMs can generate high-quality functional data, improving early design decision-making and supporting more effective design exploration. <br /> <div>

Abstract: The conceptual design phase represents a critical early stage in the product development process, where designers generate potential solutions that meet predefined design specifications based on functional requirements. Functional modeling, a foundational aspect of this phase, enables designers to reason about product functions before specific structural details are determined. A widely adopted approach to functional modeling is the Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) framework, which supports the transformation of functional intent into behavioral and structural descriptions. However, the effectiveness of function-based design is often hindered by the lack of well-structured and comprehensive functional data. This scarcity can negatively impact early design decision-making and hinder the development of accurate behavioral models. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as those based on GPT architectures, offer a promising avenue to address this gap. LLMs have demonstrated significant capabilities in language understanding and natural language processing (NLP), making them suitable for automated classification tasks. This study proposes a novel LLM-based domain adaptation (DA) framework using fine-tuning for the automated classification of mechanical assembly parts' functions. By fine-tuning LLMs on domain-specific datasets, the traditionally manual and subjective process of function annotation can be improved in both accuracy and consistency. A case study demonstrates fine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo on data from the Oregon State Design Repository (OSDR), and evaluation on the A Big CAD (ABC) dataset shows that the domain-adapted LLM can generate high-quality functional data, enhancing the semantic representation of mechanical parts and supporting more effective design exploration in early-phase engineering.

Summary:
The study introduces an agent-based model (ABM) to analyze community resilience to hurricane-induced infrastructure disruptions, specifically focusing on the interconnections between electric power and transportation networks. Agents in the ABM represent different system components, such as electric power network, transportation network, hazards, and households. By considering interactions within and among systems, the model simulates household resilience during a hurricane in Miami-Dade County, Florida. The model incorporates two key interdependencies: the role of transportation in fuel delivery to power plants and restoration teams' access, as well as the impact of power outages on transportation network components. Validated against Hurricane Irma data, the ABM demonstrates the effectiveness of a traffic lights-based restoration strategy, prioritizing signal recovery to minimize traffic disruptions and accelerate household power restoration. The study emphasizes the importance of timely traffic signal restoration, road accessibility for restoration teams, and uninterrupted fuel transportation for efficient power restoration in hurricane scenarios.

Abstract: This study presents an agent-based model (ABM) developed to simulate the resilience of a community to hurricane-induced infrastructure disruptions, focusing on the interdependencies between electric power and transportation networks. In this ABM approach, agents represent the components of a system, where interactions within a system shape intra-dependency of a system and interactions among systems shape interdependencies. To study household resilience subject to a hurricane, a library of agents has been created including electric power network, transportation network, wind/flooding hazards, and household agents. The ABM is applied over the household and infrastructure data from a community (Zip code 33147) in Miami-Dade County, Florida. Interdependencies between the two networks are modeled in two ways, (i) representing the role of transportation in fuel delivery to power plants and restoration teams' access, (ii) impact of power outage on transportation network components. Restoring traffic signals quickly is crucial as their outage can slow down traffic and increase the chance of crashes. We simulate three restoration strategies: component based, distance based, and traffic lights based restoration. The model is validated against Hurricane Irma data, showing consistent behavior with varying hazard intensities. Scenario analyses explore the impact of restoration strategies, road accessibility, and wind speed intensities on power restoration. Results demonstrate that a traffic lights based restoration strategy efficiently prioritizes signal recovery without delaying household power restoration time. Restoration of power services will be faster if restoration teams do not need to wait due to inaccessible roads and fuel transportation to power plants is not delayed.

This work introduces a shear elastoplasticity model for textile fabrics based on anisotropic Kirchhoff-Love shells with embedded fiber bending. The model accounts for rotational inter-ply frictional sliding between fiber families in textile composites experiencing large deformation, emphasizing dry fabrics like woven and non-crimp fabrics. Utilizing relative angles between fiber families as strain measures, the model is formulated using surface invariants without thickness integration. A yield function with isotropic hardening and simple evolution equation is proposed, calibrated using the picture frame test, and validated with experimental data like the bias extension test. The elastoplastic model's accuracy is confirmed through good agreement with experimental results, and its application to 3D shell problems is demonstrated. <div>

Abstract: This work presents a shear elastoplasticity model for textile fabrics within the theoretical framework of anisotropic Kirchhoff-Love shells with bending of embedded fibers proposed by Duong et al. (2023). The plasticity model aims at capturing the rotational inter-ply frictional sliding between fiber families in textile composites undergoing large deformation. Such effects are usually dominant in dry textile fabrics such as woven and non-crimp fabrics. The model explicitly uses relative angles between fiber families as strain measures for the kinematics. The plasticity model is formulated directly with surface invariants without resorting to thickness integration. Motivated by experimental observations from the picture frame test, a yield function is proposed with isotropic hardening and a simple evolution equation. A classical return mapping algorithm is employed to solve the elastoplastic problem within the isogeometric finite shell element formulation of Duong et al. (2022). The verification of the implementation is facilitated by the analytical solution for the picture frame test. The proposed plasticity model is calibrated from the picture frame test and is then validated by the bias extension test, considering available experimental data for different samples from the literature. Good agreement between model prediction and experimental data is obtained. Finally, the applicability of the elastoplasticity model to 3D shell problems is demonstrated.

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques, particularly large language models (LLMs), in finance has garnered increasing academic attention. Despite progress, existing studies predominantly focus on tasks like financial text summarization, question-answering, and stock movement prediction (binary classification), the application of LLMs to financial risk prediction remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, in this paper, we introduce RiskLabs, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to analyze and predict financial risks. RiskLabs uniquely integrates multimodal financial data, including textual and vocal information from Earnings Conference Calls (ECCs), market-related time series data, and contextual news data to improve financial risk prediction. Empirical results demonstrate RiskLabs' effectiveness in forecasting both market volatility and variance. Through comparative experiments, we examine the contributions of different data sources to financial risk assessment and highlight the crucial role of LLMs in this process. We also discuss the challenges associated with using LLMs for financial risk prediction and explore the potential of combining them with multimodal data for this purpose.

Summary: A novel physics-informed operator learning technique based on spectral methods introduces the Lippmann-Schwinger operator in Fourier space to model heterogeneous materials. The method accelerates training by enabling gradient construction on a fixed discretization in Fourier space and maps microstructure shapes to mechanical responses without labeled data. Training minimizes equilibrium in Fourier space under loading conditions, ensuring periodicity. Physically constrained and diverse training data enhance accuracy, although performance may degrade for out-of-distribution microstructures. Integration of a Fourier Neural Operator improves accuracy in predicting stress fields and offers zero-shot super-resolution capabilities in heterogeneous domains. Extension to handle 3D problems and adaptation to finite elasticity demonstrate robustness in handling nonlinear mechanical behavior. This framework shows promise for efficient and scalable prediction of mechanical responses in complex material systems while reducing training time for physics-informed neural operators. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: A novel physics-informed operator learning technique based on spectral methods is introduced to model the complex behavior of heterogeneous materials. The Lippmann-Schwinger operator in Fourier space is employed to construct physical constraints with minimal computational overhead, effectively eliminating the need for automatic differentiation. The introduced methodology accelerates the training process by enabling gradient construction on a fixed, finite discretization in Fourier space. Later, the spectral physics-informed finite operator learning (SPiFOL) framework is built based on this discretization and trained to map the arbitrary shape of microstructures to their mechanical responses (strain fields) without relying on labeled data. The training is done by minimizing equilibrium in Fourier space concerning the macroscopic loading condition, which also guarantees the periodicity. SPiFOL, as a physics-informed operator learning method, enables rapid predictions through forward inference after training. To ensure accuracy, we incorporate physical constraints and diversify the training data. However, performance may still degrade for out-of-distribution microstructures. SPiFOL is further enhanced by integrating a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO). Compared to the standard data-driven FNO, SPiFOL shows higher accuracy in predicting stress fields and provides nearly resolution-independent results. Additionally, its zero-shot super-resolution capabilities are explored in heterogeneous domains. Finally, SPiFOL is extended to handle 3D problems and further adapted to finite elasticity, demonstrating the robustness of the framework in handling nonlinear mechanical behavior. The framework shows great potential for efficient and scalable prediction of mechanical responses in complex material systems while also reducing the training time required for training physics-informed neural operators.

Abstract: Predicting Bitcoin price remains a challenging problem due to the high volatility and complex non-linear dynamics of cryptocurrency markets. Traditional time-series models, such as ARIMA and GARCH, and recurrent neural networks, like LSTMs, have been widely applied to this task but struggle to capture the regime shifts and long-range dependencies inherent in the data. In this work, we propose CryptoMamba, a novel Mamba-based State Space Model (SSM) architecture designed to effectively capture long-range dependencies in financial time-series data. Our experiments show that CryptoMamba not only provides more accurate predictions but also offers enhanced generalizability across different market conditions, surpassing the limitations of previous models. Coupled with trading algorithms for real-world scenarios, CryptoMamba demonstrates its practical utility by translating accurate forecasts into financial outcomes. Our findings signal a huge advantage for SSMs in stock and cryptocurrency price forecasting tasks.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) offers a powerful paradigm of integrating data with physical laws to address important scientific problems, such as parameter estimation, inferring hidden physics, equation discovery, and state prediction, etc. However, PIML still faces many serious optimization challenges that significantly restrict its applications. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework that transforms PIML to convex optimization to overcome all these limitations, referred to as Convex-PIML. The linear combination of B-splines is utilized to approximate the data, promoting the convexity of the loss function. By replacing the non-convex components of the loss function with convex approximations, the problem is further converted into a sequence of successively refined approximated convex optimization problems. This conversion allows the use of well-established convex optimization algorithms, obtaining solutions effectively and efficiently. Furthermore, an adaptive knot optimization method based on error estimate is introduced to mitigate the spectral bias issue of PIML, further improving the performance. The proposed theoretically guaranteed framework is tested in scenarios with distinct types of physical prior. The results indicate that optimization problems are effectively solved in these scenarios, highlighting the potential of the framework for broad applications.

Summary:<br />
The article discusses the efficient design and evaluation of mechanical metamaterials using additive manufacturing. It emphasizes the need to establish connections between unit cell designs and their mechanical properties, which can be computationally intensive. The study employs principal component analysis to identify key features from a large dataset of 2D metamaterials. Fast Fourier transform-based simulations are utilized to calculate the effective elastic stiffness of different unit cell designs. Gaussian process regression is then applied to create reduced-order models mapping designs to their elastic constants. The research demonstrates the creation of robust structure-property maps through a low-dimensional representation of the dataset. Additionally, an active learning approach is used to train a surrogate model with minimal data points, showcasing the ability to generate accurate maps with a small fraction of the original dataset. <div>

Abstract: The capabilities of additive manufacturing have facilitated the design and production of mechanical metamaterials with diverse unit cell geometries. Establishing linkages between the vast design space of unit cells and their effective mechanical properties is critical for the efficient design and performance evaluation of such metamaterials. However, physics-based simulations of metamaterial unit cells across the entire design space are computationally expensive, necessitating a materials informatics framework to efficiently capture complex structure-property relationships. In this work, principal component analysis of 2-point correlation functions is performed to extract the salient features from a large dataset of randomly generated 2D metamaterials. Physics-based simulations are performed using a fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based homogenization approach to efficiently compute the homogenized effective elastic stiffness across the extensive unit cell designs. Subsequently, Gaussian process regression is used to generate reduced-order surrogates, mapping unit cell designs to their homogenized effective elastic constant. It is demonstrated that the adopted workflow enables a high-value low-dimensional representation of the voluminous stochastic metamaterial dataset, facilitating the construction of robust structure-property maps. Finally, an uncertainty-based active learning framework is utilized to train a surrogate model with a significantly smaller number of data points compared to the original full dataset. It is shown that a dataset as small as $0.61\%$ of the entire dataset is sufficient to generate accurate and robust structure-property maps.

This study presents a novel approach using a graph neural network (GNN) for mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. The GNN operates on localized meshes of elements to improve accuracy. The architecture includes coarse-scale and fine-scale processors separated by a graph unpooling layer for multiscale modeling. Results from simulations of Taylor-Green Vortex and backward-facing step flow demonstrate the GNN's ability to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to coarse-scale and multiscale models. Reconstruction errors increase with higher Reynolds numbers. Additionally, the GNN shows promising capabilities for geometry extrapolation in cross-mesh scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2409.07769v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph neural network (GNN) approach is introduced in this work which enables mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor-Green Vortex and backward-facing step flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations. Reconstruction errors for fixed architectures were found to increase in proportion to the Reynolds number. Geometry extrapolation studies on a separate cavity flow configuration show promising cross-mesh capabilities of the super-resolution strategy.

Abstract: The rising demand for high-value electronics necessitates advanced manufacturing techniques capable of meeting stringent specifications for precise, complex, and compact devices, driving the shift toward innovative additive manufacturing (AM) solutions. Aerosol Jet Printing (AJP) is a versatile AM technique that utilizes aerosolized functional materials to accurately print intricate patterns onto diverse substrates. Machine learning (ML)- based Process-Structure-Property (PSP) modeling is essential for enhancing AJP manufacturing, as it quantitatively connects process parameters, structural features, and resulting material properties. However, current ML approaches for modeling PSP relationships in AJP face significant limitations in handling multimodal and multiscale data, underscoring a critical need for generative methods capable of comprehensive analysis through multimodal and multiscale fusion. To address this challenge, this study introduces a novel generative modeling methodology leveraging diffusion models for PSP data fusion in AJP. The proposed method integrates multimodal, multiscale PSP features in two phases: (1) registering the features, and (2) fusing them to generate causal relationships between PSP attributes. A case study demonstrates the registration and fusion of optical microscopy (OM) images and confocal profilometry (CP) data from AJP, along with the fine-tuning of the fusion step. The results effectively capture complex PSP relationships, offering deeper insights into digital twins of dynamic manufacturing systems.

Summary:
The study introduces a novel method for estimating thermal comfort by incorporating spatial environmental data reconstructed using the Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (Gappy POD) algorithm. This addresses limitations of fixed-location sensors by enabling accurate reconstruction of indoor temperature fields. A group PMV-based control framework is developed to consider the thermal comfort of multiple occupants, allowing for individual and group-level thermal condition calculations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Gappy POD algorithm in temperature reconstruction with a low average relative error. The spatial variability in PMV values based on occupant location highlights the importance of adaptive thermal control strategies. The study underscores the significance of adaptive thermal control strategies that consider both spatial and individual variability for enhanced occupant-centric building operations. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving thermal comfort while maintaining energy efficiency is a critical objective in building system control. Conventional thermal comfort models, such as the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV), rely on both environmental and personal variables. However, the use of fixed-location sensors limits the ability to capture spatial variability, which reduces the accuracy of occupant-specific comfort estimation. To address this limitation, this study proposes a new PMV estimation method that incorporates spatial environmental data reconstructed using the Gappy Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (Gappy POD) algorithm. In addition, a group PMV-based control framework is developed to account for the thermal comfort of multiple occupants. The Gappy POD method enables fast and accurate reconstruction of indoor temperature fields from sparse sensor measurements. Using these reconstructed fields and occupant location data, spatially resolved PMV values are calculated. Group-level thermal conditions are then derived through statistical aggregation methods and used to control indoor temperature in a multi-occupant living lab environment. Experimental results show that the Gappy POD algorithm achieves an average relative error below 3\% in temperature reconstruction. PMV distributions varied by up to 1.26 scale units depending on occupant location. Moreover, thermal satisfaction outcomes varied depending on the group PMV method employed. These findings underscore the importance for adaptive thermal control strategies that incorporate both spatial and individual variability, offering valuable insights for future occupant-centric building operations.

Abstract: Dynamic manufacturing processes exhibit complex characteristics defined by time-varying parameters, nonlinear behaviors, and uncertainties. These characteristics require sophisticated in-situ monitoring techniques utilizing multimodal sensor data and adaptive control systems that can respond to real-time feedback while maintaining product quality. Recently, generative machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex distributions and generating synthetic data while handling these manufacturing uncertainties. However, adopting these generative technologies in dynamic manufacturing systems lacks a functional control-oriented perspective to translate their probabilistic understanding into actionable process controls while respecting constraints. This review presents a functional classification of Prediction-Based, Direct Policy, Quality Inference, and Knowledge-Integrated approaches, offering a perspective for understanding existing ML-enhanced control systems and incorporating generative ML. The analysis of generative ML architectures within this framework demonstrates control-relevant properties and potential to extend current ML-enhanced approaches where conventional methods prove insufficient. We show generative ML's potential for manufacturing control through decision-making applications, process guidance, simulation, and digital twins, while identifying critical research gaps: separation between generation and control functions, insufficient physical understanding of manufacturing phenomena, and challenges adapting models from other domains. To address these challenges, we propose future research directions aimed at developing integrated frameworks that combine generative ML and control technologies to address the dynamic complexities of modern manufacturing systems.

Summary:<br />
In scenarios where high-fidelity dynamical systems require repetitive evaluation across a wide range of parameter configurations without access to governing equations, data-driven model reduction techniques are preferred. This study introduces an active learning method for constructing a parametric data-driven reduced-order model by selecting crucial parameter samples from the parameter domain. The approach involves representing high-fidelity solution snapshots in parameter-specific linear subspaces using proper orthogonal decomposition, with the relative distance between these subspaces guiding the active learning process. A distance metric is provided for comparing similarity between linear subspaces of different dimensions. The proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is successfully applied to enhance existing reduced-order modeling methods through active-learning-driven extensions. Positive results are demonstrated for two parametric physical models, showcasing the effectiveness of the SDE-AL approach.  <div>

Abstract: In situations where the solution of a high-fidelity dynamical system needs to be evaluated repeatedly, over a vast pool of parametric configurations and in absence of access to the underlying governing equations, data-driven model reduction techniques are preferable. We propose a novel active learning approach to build a parametric data-driven reduced-order model (ROM) by greedily picking the most important parameter samples from the parameter domain. As a result, during the ROM construction phase, the number of high-fidelity solutions dynamically grow in a principled fashion. The high-fidelity solution snapshots are expressed in several parameter-specific linear subspaces, with the help of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), and the relative distance between these subspaces is used as a guiding mechanism to perform active learning. For successfully achieving this, we provide a distance measure to evaluate the similarity between pairs of linear subspaces with different dimensions, and also show that this distance measure is a metric. The usability of the proposed subspace-distance-enabled active learning (SDE-AL) framework is demonstrated by augmenting two existing non-intrusive reduced-order modeling approaches, and providing their active-learning-driven (ActLearn) extensions, namely, SDE-ActLearn-POD-KSNN, and SDE-ActLearn-POD-NN. Furthermore, we report positive results for two parametric physical models, highlighting the efficiency of the proposed SDE-AL approach.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel RL algorithm, Partial SMILES Validation-PPO (PSV-PPO), designed to address catastrophic forgetting during molecule generation in drug discovery. By incorporating real-time partial SMILES validation at each step of the sequence generation process, PSV-PPO prevents the deterioration of molecule validity while promoting exploration. Unlike traditional approaches that validate molecules only after completion, PSV-PPO evaluates potential branches at each step, ensuring high validity rates even during aggressive exploration. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that PSV-PPO reduces invalid structures while maintaining competitive performance. The framework of PSV-PPO can be extended to incorporate additional domain knowledge, enhancing RL applications in drug discovery. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2505.00530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SMILES-based molecule generation has emerged as a powerful approach in drug discovery. Deep reinforcement learning (RL) using large language model (LLM) has been incorporated into the molecule generation process to achieve high matching score in term of likelihood of desired molecule candidates. However, a critical challenge in this approach is catastrophic forgetting during the RL phase, where knowledge such as molecule validity, which often exceeds 99\% during pretraining, significantly deteriorates. Current RL algorithms applied in drug discovery, such as REINVENT, use prior models as anchors to retian pretraining knowledge, but these methods lack robust exploration mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose Partial SMILES Validation-PPO (PSV-PPO), a novel RL algorithm that incorporates real-time partial SMILES validation to prevent catastrophic forgetting while encouraging exploration. Unlike traditional RL approaches that validate molecule structures only after generating entire sequences, PSV-PPO performs stepwise validation at each auto-regressive step, evaluating not only the selected token candidate but also all potential branches stemming from the prior partial sequence. This enables early detection of invalid partial SMILES across all potential paths. As a result, PSV-PPO maintains high validity rates even during aggressive exploration of the vast chemical space. Our experiments on the PMO and GuacaMol benchmark datasets demonstrate that PSV-PPO significantly reduces the number of invalid generated structures while maintaining competitive exploration and optimization performance. While our work primarily focuses on maintaining validity, the framework of PSV-PPO can be extended in future research to incorporate additional forms of valuable domain knowledge, further enhancing reinforcement learning applications in drug discovery.

Abstract: Automated Market Maker (AMM)-based Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) are crucial in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), but Ethereum implementations suffer from high transaction costs and price synchronization challenges. To address these limitations, we compare the XRP Ledger (XRPL)-AMM-Decentralized Exchange (DEX), a protocol-level implementation, against a Generic AMM-based DEX (G-AMM-DEX) on Ethereum, akin to Uniswap's V2 AMM implementation, through agent-based simulations using real market data and multiple volatility scenarios generated via Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). Results demonstrate that the XRPL-AMM-DEX achieves superior price synchronization, reduced slippage, and improved returns due to XRPL's lower fees and shorter block times, with benefits amplifying during market volatility. The integrated Continuous Auction Mechanism (CAM) further mitigates impermanent loss by redistributing arbitrage value to Liquidity Providers (LPs). To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first comparative analysis between protocol-level and smart contract AMM-based DEX implementations and the first agent-based simulation validating theoretical auction mechanisms for AMM-based DEXs.

Abstract: The deployment of machine learning (ML)-based process monitoring systems has significantly advanced additive manufacturing (AM) by enabling real-time defect detection, quality assessment, and process optimization. However, redundancy is a critical yet often overlooked challenge in the deployment and operation of ML-based AM process monitoring systems. Excessive redundancy leads to increased equipment costs, compromised model performance, and high computational requirements, posing barriers to industrial adoption. However, existing research lacks a unified definition of redundancy and a systematic framework for its evaluation and mitigation. This paper defines redundancy in ML-based AM process monitoring and categorizes it into sample-level, feature-level, and model-level redundancy. A comprehensive multi-level redundancy mitigation (MLRM) framework is proposed, incorporating advanced methods such as data registration, downscaling, cross-modality knowledge transfer, and model pruning to systematically reduce redundancy while improving model performance. The framework is validated through an ML-based in-situ defect detection case study for directed energy deposition (DED), demonstrating a 91% reduction in latency, a 47% decrease in error rate, and a 99.4% reduction in storage requirements. Additionally, the proposed approach lowers sensor costs and energy consumption, enabling a lightweight, cost-effective, and scalable monitoring system. By defining redundancy and introducing a structured mitigation framework, this study establishes redundancy analysis and mitigation as a key enabler of efficient ML-based process monitoring in production environments.

<div> Neural Networks, Physics-Informed, PDEs, Multi-grid method, High-frequency components <br />
Summary: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving PDEs but struggle with stiff and high-frequency problems, leading to accuracy issues. An alternative approach inspired by the multi-grid method is proposed to address these challenges. By training with different levels of samples, errors of varying frequencies can be efficiently removed, improving accuracy without complex tuning. The method is tested on 1D and 2D equations with high-frequency components and Lid-driven cavity flows at different Reynolds numbers. Results show a 30% to 60% accuracy improvement and success in solving complex high-frequency PDEs up to Re=5000. Synergies with transfer learning are also explored for more challenging problems. <div>

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks have emerged as a promising methodology for solving PDEs, gaining significant attention in computer science and various physics-related fields. Despite being demonstrated the ability to incorporate the physics of laws for versatile applications, PINNs still struggle with the challenging problems which are stiff to be solved and/or have high-frequency components in the solutions, resulting in accuracy and convergence issues. It may not only increase computational costs, but also lead to accuracy loss or solution divergence. In this study, an alternative approach is proposed to mitigate the above-mentioned problems. Inspired by the multi-grid method in CFD community, the underlying idea of the current approach is to efficiently remove different frequency errors via training with different levels of training samples, resulting in a simpler way to improve the training accuracy without spending time in fine-tuning of neural network structures, loss weights as well as hyperparameters. To demonstrate the efficacy of current approach, we first investigate canonical 1D ODE with high-frequency component and 2D convection-diffusion equation with V-cycle training strategy. Finally, the current method is employed for the classical benchmark problem of steady Lid-driven cavity flows at different Reynolds numbers, to investigate the applicability and efficacy for the problem involved multiple modes of high and low frequency. By virtue of various training sequence modes, improvement through predictions lead to 30% to 60% accuracy improvement. We also investigate the synergies between current method and transfer learning techniques for more challenging problems (i.e., higher Re). From the present results, it also revealed that the current framework can produce good predictions even for the case of Re=5000, demonstrating the ability to solve complex high-frequency PDEs.

Summary:<br />
DiffLiB is introduced as a high-fidelity LIB simulation framework that utilizes advanced differentiable programming techniques for efficient gradient-based inverse parameter identification in the complex DFN model. Customized automatic differentiation rules are defined to enable efficient gradient-based optimization, improving computational performance significantly compared to gradient-free methods. The framework shows excellent agreement in forward predictions, maintaining low terminal voltage discrepancies. In parameter identification tasks using measured voltage data, DiffLiB demonstrates superior computational performance with significantly fewer forward predictions and less computational time required. These results highlight DiffLiB as a versatile and powerful computational tool for advanced LIB development. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.20674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics-based Doyle-Fuller-Newman (DFN) model, widely adopted for its precise electrochemical modeling, stands out among various simulation models of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Although the DFN model is powerful in forward predictive analysis, the inverse identification of its model parameters has remained a long-standing challenge. The numerous unknown parameters associated with the nonlinear, time-dependent, and multi-scale DFN model are extremely difficult to be determined accurately and efficiently, hindering the practical use of such battery simulation models in industrial applications. To tackle this challenge, we introduce DiffLiB, a high-fidelity finite-element-based LIB simulation framework, equipped with advanced differentiable programming techniques so that efficient gradient-based inverse parameter identification is enabled. Customized automatic differentiation rules are defined by identifying the VJP (vector-Jacobian product) structure in the chain rule and implemented using adjoint-based implicit differentiation methods. Four numerical examples, including both 2D and 3D forward predictions and inverse parameter identification, are presented to validate the accuracy and computational efficiency of DiffLiB. Benchmarking against COMSOL demonstrates excellent agreement in forward predictions, with terminal voltage discrepancies maintaining a root-mean-square error (RMSE) below 2 mV across all test conditions. In parameter identification tasks using experimentally measured voltage data, the proposed gradient-based optimization scheme achieves superior computational performance, with 96% fewer forward predictions and 72% less computational time compared with gradient-free approaches. These results demonstrate that DiffLiB is a versatile and powerful computational framework for the development of advanced LIBs.

<div> Keywords: heterogeneous media, elastic behavior, fracture behavior, homogenization, randomization <br />
Summary: 
The study examines the elastic and fracture behaviors of discrete models of heterogeneous media with different forms of randomization. These models achieve homogeneity through volumetric-deviatoric decomposition or stress homogenization methods. It is observed that stress oscillations in heterogeneous geometric structures cannot be accurately replicated by randomizing elastic parameters in homogeneous models. Additionally, the macroscopic response to uniaxial tension shows differences between homogenized and standard materials, with the homogenized material exhibiting higher peak stress and steeper softening. However, randomizing elastic parameters and adjusting inelastic parameters can bring the macroscopic response closer to the standard material, despite differing damage distributions. This research sheds light on the potential for controlled random assignment of heterogeneity in homogeneous models and provides valuable insights into the behavior of these materials. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.20861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study investigates the elastic and fracture behaviors of discrete, elastically homogeneous models of heterogeneous media. The homogeneity is accomplished either by volumetric-deviatoric decomposition of constitutive function or by an auxiliary stress homogenization method. The elastic parameters of the homogenized material models are randomly varied in space to introduce heterogeneity independently of the geometric properties of the discrete model. Several forms of randomization are investigated using statistical properties of nodal stress oscillations in periodic representative volume elements (RVEs). It is found that the stress oscillations present in discrete models built on heterogeneous geometric structures with standard constitutive models cannot be replicated by randomization of the elastically homogeneous discrete system. The marginal distributions as well as dependencies between stress tensor components cannot be adequately matched.
  With respect to quasi-brittle fracture behavior, the macroscopic response of the different models is studied for the load case of uniaxial tension. The elastically homogenized material provides higher peak stress occurring at lower strain levels and a steeper softening phase, compared to the standard material. Randomization of the elastic material parameters, as well as adjustment of inelastic material parameters, brings the macroscopic response of the homogenized material close to that of the standard material, although the damage distribution prior to the strain localization differs. These findings provide insight into the potential for controlled, random assignment of heterogeneity in homogeneous models, using physically-based discretizations of material structure with standard constitutive models for comparison.

Summary: 
Thermo-mechanical processes at the atomistic scale in superelastic polyimide are studied using a sequential multiscale approach. The continuum-scale smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model is coupled with atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) to investigate thermal expansion and stress relaxation. Constitutive modelling integrates thermo-mechanical properties derived from MD simulations. Benchmark tests on heat transfer validate the results. Simulation of the insulation capabilities of superelastic polyimide on an aluminium plate shows significant reduction in thermal stress, strain, and temperature development. The multiscale method effectively captures thermo-mechanical interactions in superelastic polyimide, demonstrating its potential for exploring material behavior under thermal stress. <div>

Abstract: Many thermo-mechanical processes, such as thermal expansion and stress relaxation, originate at the atomistic scale. We develop a sequential multiscale approach to study thermally stressed superelastic polyimide to explore these effects. The continuum-scale smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model is coupled with atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) through constitutive modelling, where thermo-mechanical properties and equations of state are derived from MD simulations. The results are verified through benchmark problems of heat transfer. Finally, we analyse the insulating capabilities of superelastic polyimide by simulating the thermal response of an aluminium plate. The result shows a considerable reduction in the thermal stress, strain and temperature field development in the aluminium plate when superelastic polyimide is used as an insulator. The present work demonstrates the effectiveness of the multi-scale method in capturing thermo-mechanical interactions in superelastic polyimide.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new variance reduction method for floating random walk-based capacitance extraction, a method commonly used in integrated circuit analysis. This new method, designed to address challenges in ever-denser process technologies and layout-dependent effects, offers a significant improvement in extraction efficiency. It complements existing mathematical formulations for variance reduction and has been shown to reduce variance in all extractions, particularly those affected by layout-dependent effects. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the new method can decrease the number of walks required by up to 30% and reduce overall extraction times even further compared to previously proposed variance reduction techniques for floating random walks. This advancement in capacitance extraction techniques could have a significant impact on the efficiency and accuracy of integrated circuit analysis for complex designs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Floating random walk-based capacitance extraction has emerged in recent years as a tried and true approach for extracting parasitic capacitance in very large scale integrated circuits. Being a Monte Carlo method, its performance is dependent on the variance of sampled quantities and variance reduction methods are crucial for the challenges posed by ever denser process technologies and layout-dependent effects. In this work, we present a novel, universal variance reduction method for floating random walk-based capacitance extraction, which is conceptually simple, highly efficient and provably reduces variance in all extractions, especially when layout-dependent effects are present. It is complementary to existing mathematical formulations for variance reduction and its performance gains are experienced on top of theirs. Numerical experiments demonstrate substantial such gains of up to 30% in number of walks necessary and even more in actual extraction times compared to the best previously proposed variance reduction approaches for the floating random-walk.

Summary:<br />
This study introduces 4DGS-CC, a contextual coding framework for compressing 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) data to address storage challenges. The framework decomposes the 4DGS data into 4D neural voxels and 3DGS components for efficient compression. It leverages Neural Voxel Contextual Coding (NVCC) and Vector Quantization Contextual Coding (VQCC) to compress the data, achieving a storage reduction of approximately 12 times while maintaining rendering fidelity. The approach separates temporal and spatial dimensions in the data decomposition process and utilizes prior information for contextual coding using NVCC. Additionally, a codebook is employed to store spherical harmonics information from canonical 3DGS, which is compressed using VQCC with auxiliary hyperpriors. The integrated NVCC and VQCC enable tailored multi-rate compression of 4DGS data, making it suitable for specific storage requirements. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving significant storage savings without compromising data quality. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Storage is a significant challenge in reconstructing dynamic scenes with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) data. In this work, we introduce 4DGS-CC, a contextual coding framework that compresses 4DGS data to meet specific storage constraints.Building upon the established deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method, our approach decomposes 4DGS data into 4D neural voxels and a canonical 3DGS component, which are then compressed using Neural Voxel Contextual Coding (NVCC) and Vector Quantization Contextual Coding (VQCC), respectively.Specifically, we first decompose the 4D neural voxels into distinct quantized features by separating the temporal and spatial dimensions. To losslessly compress each quantized feature, we leverage the previously compressed features from the temporal and spatial dimensions as priors and apply NVCC to generate the spatiotemporal context for contextual coding.Next, we employ a codebook to store spherical harmonics information from canonical 3DGS as quantized vectors, which are then losslessly compressed by using VQCC with the auxiliary learned hyperpriors for contextual coding, thereby reducing redundancy within the codebook.By integrating NVCC and VQCC, our contextual coding framework, 4DGS-CC, enables multi-rate 4DGS data compression tailored to specific storage requirements. Extensive experiments on three 4DGS data compression benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves an average storage reduction of approximately 12 times while maintaining rendering fidelity compared to our baseline 4DGS approach.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a probabilistic model of subspaces based on probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA). The method uses quantities derived from probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix and the principal subspaces in an embedding space. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition. The constructed stochastic subspace can help characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The method is justified by probabilistic PCA, satisfying linear constraints like boundary conditions, and has only one hyperparameter, simplifying training. The algorithm is easy to implement. Comparisons with existing approaches show promising results in low-dimensional visualization, parametric static problems, and dynamics modeling of space structures. <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes a probabilistic model of subspaces based on the probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA). Given a sample of vectors in the embedding space -- commonly known as a snapshot matrix -- this method uses quantities derived from the probabilistic PCA to construct distributions of the sample matrix, as well as the principal subspaces. It is applicable to projection-based reduced-order modeling methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and related model reduction methods. The stochastic subspace thus constructed can be used, for example, to characterize model-form uncertainty in computational mechanics. The proposed method has multiple desirable properties: (1) it is naturally justified by the probabilistic PCA and has analytic forms for the induced random matrix models; (2) it satisfies linear constraints, such as boundary conditions of all kinds, by default; (3) it has only one hyperparameter, which significantly simplifies training; and (4) its algorithm is very easy to implement. We compare the proposed method with existing approaches in a low-dimensional visualization example and a parametric static problem, and demonstrate its performance in a dynamics model of a space structure.

<div> classification, scientific software, longevity, survival models, open-source

Summary:
Using large language models, the study classifies over 18,000 scientific software projects, analyzing their attributes to understand factors affecting longevity. Infrastructural layers, downstream dependencies, publication mentions, and government participants are linked to longer lifespans, while newer projects with academic participants have shorter lifespans. Despite common perceptions, scientific projects have a longer lifespan than non-scientific open-source projects. The curated dataset provides a valuable resource for future research on scientific software, offering insights that could help prolong the lifespan of both scientific and non-scientific software projects. <div>

Abstract: Scientific software is essential to scientific innovation and in many ways it is distinct from other types of software. Abandoned (or unmaintained), buggy, and hard to use software, a perception often associated with scientific software can hinder scientific progress, yet, in contrast to other types of software, its longevity is poorly understood. Existing data curation efforts are fragmented by science domain and/or are small in scale and lack key attributes. We use large language models to classify public software repositories in World of Code into distinct scientific domains and layers of the software stack, curating a large and diverse collection of over 18,000 scientific software projects. Using this data, we estimate survival models to understand how the domain, infrastructural layer, and other attributes of scientific software affect its longevity. We further obtain a matched sample of non-scientific software repositories and investigate the differences. We find that infrastructural layers, downstream dependencies, mentions of publications, and participants from government are associated with a longer lifespan, while newer projects with participants from academia had shorter lifespan. Against common expectations, scientific projects have a longer lifetime than matched non-scientific open-source software projects. We expect our curated attribute-rich collection to support future research on scientific software and provide insights that may help extend longevity of both scientific and other projects.

<br />
Summary: 
The study examines the challenges of spreading fine powders in powder bed additive manufacturing processes and proposes a transverse oscillation kinematic for powder spreading. Computational simulations using a DEM-FEM framework show that transverse oscillation of a non-rotating roller can facilitate the spreading of dense powder layers with high packing fractions. Experimental validation confirms the computational results, with high packing fractions achieved for transverse oscillation frequencies above 200 Hz. Statistical analysis demonstrates that increasing transverse surface velocity improves layer uniformity and reduces cracking defects. The proposed transverse oscillation kinematic has the potential to produce thin and consistently uniform powder layers in additive manufacturing processes, offering a promising solution for handling highly cohesive powders. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.18981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Powder bed additive manufacturing processes such as laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) or binder jetting (BJ) benefit from using fine (D50 $\leq20~\mu m$) powders. However, the increasing level of cohesion with decreasing particle size makes spreading a uniform and continuous layer challenging. As a result, LPBF typically employs a coarser size distribution, and rotating roller mechanisms are used in BJ machines, that can create wave-like surface profiles due to roller run-out.
  In this work, a transverse oscillation kinematic for powder spreading is proposed, explored computationally, and validated experimentally. Simulations are performed using an integrated discrete element-finite element (DEM-FEM) framework and predict that transverse oscillation of a non-rotating roller facilitates the spreading of dense powder layers (beyond 50% packing fraction) with a high level of robustness to kinematic parameters. The experimental study utilizes a custom-built mechanized powder spreading testbed and X-ray transmission imaging for the analysis of spread powder layers. Experimental results generally validate the computational results, however, also exhibit parasitic layer cracking. For transverse oscillation frequencies above 200 Hz, powder layers of high packing fraction (between 50-60%) were formed, and for increased layer thicknesses, highly uniform and continuous layers were deposited. Statistical analysis of the experimental powder layer morphology as a function of kinematic spreading parameters revealed that an increasing transverse surface velocity improves layer uniformity and reduces cracking defects. This suggests that with minor improvements to the machine design, the proposed transverse oscillation kinematic has the potential to result in thin and consistently uniform powder layers of highly cohesive powder.

<br />
Summary: The study introduces a novel approach, vOED-NFs, which utilizes normalizing flows (NFs) to enhance variational optimal experimental design (vOED) by approximating posterior distributions. The method employs NFs with a conditional invertible neural network architecture and includes a summary network for data dimension reduction. Monte Carlo estimators and gradient expressions enable simultaneous optimization of variational parameters and design variables. The algorithm is validated on benchmark problems and applied to scenarios involving cathodic electrophoretic deposition and stochastic modeling of aphid population. Results demonstrate that a composition of 4-5 coupling layers reduces EIG estimation bias, while NFs provide accurate approximations of posterior distributions, effectively capturing non-Gaussian and multi-modal features. The vOED-NFs approach offers a computationally efficient and accurate method for Bayesian optimal experimental design without the need for explicit likelihood evaluations. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) seeks experiments that maximize the expected information gain (EIG) in model parameters. Directly estimating the EIG using nested Monte Carlo is computationally expensive and requires an explicit likelihood. Variational OED (vOED), in contrast, estimates a lower bound of the EIG without likelihood evaluations by approximating the posterior distributions with variational forms, and then tightens the bound by optimizing its variational parameters. We introduce the use of normalizing flows (NFs) for representing variational distributions in vOED; we call this approach vOED-NFs. Specifically, we adopt NFs with a conditional invertible neural network architecture built from compositions of coupling layers, and enhanced with a summary network for data dimension reduction. We present Monte Carlo estimators to the lower bound along with gradient expressions to enable a gradient-based simultaneous optimization of the variational parameters and the design variables. The vOED-NFs algorithm is then validated in two benchmark problems, and demonstrated on a partial differential equation-governed application of cathodic electrophoretic deposition and an implicit likelihood case with stochastic modeling of aphid population. The findings suggest that a composition of 4--5 coupling layers is able to achieve lower EIG estimation bias, under a fixed budget of forward model runs, compared to previous approaches. The resulting NFs produce approximate posteriors that agree well with the true posteriors, able to capture non-Gaussian and multi-modal features effectively.

Abstract: Nucleic acids such as mRNA have emerged as a promising therapeutic modality with the capability of addressing a wide range of diseases. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery platform for nucleic acids were used in the COVID-19 vaccines and have received much attention. While modern manufacturing processes which involve rapidly mixing an organic stream containing the lipids with an aqueous stream containing the nucleic acids are conceptually straightforward, detailed understanding of LNP formation and structure is still limited and scale-up can be challenging. Mathematical and computational methods are a promising avenue for deepening scientific understanding of the LNP formation process and facilitating improved process development and control. This article describes strategies for the mechanistic modeling of LNP formation, starting with strategies to estimate and predict important physicochemical properties of the various species such as diffusivities and solubilities. Subsequently, a framework is outlined for constructing mechanistic models of reactor- and particle-scale processes. Insights gained from the various models are mapped back to product quality attributes and process insights. Lastly, the use of the models to guide development of advanced process control and optimization strategies is discussed.

Summary:
PatternPaint is a diffusion-based framework designed for generating diverse VLSI layout patterns essential for design for manufacturing. It addresses the challenge of limited design-rule-compliant training samples and simplifies complex layout pattern generation through inpainting processes. The framework incorporates a template-based denoising scheme and utilizes few-shot finetuning on a pretrained image foundation model with only 20 design-rule-compliant samples. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PatternPaint in generating legal patterns in complex 2D metal interconnect design rule settings for sub-3nm technology nodes. It achieves high diversity scores and improves legality rates significantly through few-shot finetuning. This approach offers a production-ready solution for layout pattern generation in the development of new technology nodes. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2409.01348v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating diverse VLSI layout patterns is essential for various downstream tasks in design for manufacturing, as design rules continually evolve during the development of new technology nodes. However, existing training-based methods for layout pattern generation rely on large datasets. In practical scenarios, especially when developing a new technology node, obtaining such extensive layout data is challenging. Consequently, training models with large datasets becomes impractical, limiting the scalability and adaptability of prior approaches. To this end, we propose PatternPaint, a diffusion-based framework capable of generating legal patterns with limited design-rule-compliant training samples. PatternPaint simplifies complex layout pattern generation into a series of inpainting processes with a template-based denoising scheme. Furthermore, we perform few-shot finetuning on a pretrained image foundation model with only 20 design-rule-compliant samples. Experimental results show that using a sub-3nm technology node (Intel 18A), our model is the only one that can generate legal patterns in complex 2D metal interconnect design rule settings among all previous works and achieves a high diversity score. Additionally, our few-shot finetuning can boost the legality rate with 1.87X improvement compared to the original pretrained model. As a result, we demonstrate a production-ready approach for layout pattern generation in developing new technology nodes.

Summary: 
This work proposes a dynamic model for the DeFi lending market, incorporating evolving demand and supply curves and an adaptive interest rate controller to respond to market changes in real-time. The Recursive Least Squares algorithm is used to track external market conditions, ensuring stable utilization and managing default and liquidation risks. The algorithm provides theoretical guarantees on interest rate convergence and utilization stability while also addressing vulnerability to adversarial manipulation. Two approaches are proposed to mitigate manipulation: detecting extreme fluctuations and enhancing elasticity through interest rate derivative markets. The dynamic model shows low error rates on real data and the interest rate controller outperforms static curve protocols in optimizing utilization and reducing liquidations. <div>
arXiv:2410.13105v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has revolutionized lending by replacing intermediaries with algorithm-driven liquidity pools. However, existing platforms like Aave and Compound rely on static interest rate curves and collateral requirements that struggle to adapt to rapid market changes, leading to inefficiencies in utilization and increased risks of liquidations. In this work, we propose a dynamic model of the lending market based on evolving demand and supply curves, alongside an adaptive interest rate controller that responds in real-time to shifting market conditions. Using a Recursive Least Squares algorithm, our controller tracks the external market and achieves stable utilization, while also controlling default and liquidation risk. We provide theoretical guarantees on the interest rate convergence and utilization stability of our algorithm. We establish bounds on the system's vulnerability to adversarial manipulation compared to static curves, while quantifying the trade-off between adaptivity and adversarial robustness. We propose two complementary approaches to mitigating adversarial manipulation: an algorithmic method that detects extreme demand and supply fluctuations and a market-based strategy that enhances elasticity, potentially via interest rate derivative markets. Our dynamic curve demand/supply model demonstrates a low best-fit error on Aave data, while our interest rate controller significantly outperforms static curve protocols in maintaining optimal utilization and minimizing liquidations.

The study investigates the performance of quantum algorithms in solving a linear one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation. It compares Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) with Trotterization, Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (VarQTE), and Adaptive Variational Quantum Dynamics Simulation (AVQDS) on small quantum hardware. While VQE on a noiseless simulator achieves high accuracy with low infidelities, the dynamics algorithms suffer from errors due to noise and limited shot statistics on hardware. VQE outperforms the dynamics methods in terms of accuracy as it reaches low infidelities with moderate circuit depths. The comparison provides insights into the accuracy and resource demands of different algorithms for solving partial differential equations. The study concludes with a discussion on potential extensions to higher-dimensional and nonlinear PDEs relevant to engineering and finance. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: We investigate the potential of near-term quantum algorithms for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), focusing on a linear one-dimensional advection-diffusion equation as a test case. This study benchmarks a ground-state algorithm, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), against three leading quantum dynamics algorithms, Trotterization, Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (VarQTE), and Adaptive Variational Quantum Dynamics Simulation (AVQDS), applied to the same PDE on small quantum hardware. While Trotterization is fully quantum, VarQTE and AVQDS are variational algorithms that reduce circuit depth for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, hardware results from these dynamics methods show sizable errors due to noise and limited shot statistics. To establish a noise-free performance baseline, we implement the VQE-based solver on a noiseless statevector simulator. Our results show VQE can reach final-time infidelities as low as ${O}(10^{-9})$ with $N=4$ qubits and moderate circuit depths, outperforming hardware-deployed dynamics methods that show infidelities $\gtrsim 10^{-1}$. By comparing noiseless VQE to shot-based and hardware-run algorithms, we assess their accuracy and resource demands, providing a baseline for future quantum PDE solvers. We conclude with a discussion of limitations and potential extensions to higher-dimensional, nonlinear PDEs relevant to engineering and finance.

Summary:
The study focuses on using symbolic regression to create data-driven equations that describe the behavior of the Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) index during geomagnetic storms. By analyzing historical data from the NASA OMNIweb database, including various solar wind parameters, the study aims to develop models that accurately predict the evolution of the Dst index. The models generated by the PySR framework showcase a hierarchy of complexity levels and outperform traditional empirical models in terms of accuracy and interpretability. The evaluation of the models on historical storm events, such as the 2003 Halloween Storm and the 2015 St. Patrick's Day Storm, demonstrates their effectiveness in capturing nonlinear dependencies and thresholding effects in Dst evolution. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms driving geomagnetic storms and offers interpretable mathematical expressions for predicting their intensity.

Abstract: Geomagnetic storms are large-scale disturbances of the Earth's magnetosphere driven by solar wind interactions, posing significant risks to space-based and ground-based infrastructure. The Disturbance Storm Time (Dst) index quantifies geomagnetic storm intensity by measuring global magnetic field variations. This study applies symbolic regression to derive data-driven equations describing the temporal evolution of the Dst index. We use historical data from the NASA OMNIweb database, including solar wind density, bulk velocity, convective electric field, dynamic pressure, and magnetic pressure. The PySR framework, an evolutionary algorithm-based symbolic regression library, is used to identify mathematical expressions linking dDst/dt to key solar wind. The resulting models include a hierarchy of complexity levels and enable a comparison with well-established empirical models such as the Burton-McPherron-Russell and O'Brien-McPherron models. The best-performing symbolic regression models demonstrate superior accuracy in most cases, particularly during moderate geomagnetic storms, while maintaining physical interpretability. Performance evaluation on historical storm events includes the 2003 Halloween Storm, the 2015 St. Patrick's Day Storm, and a 2017 moderate storm. The results provide interpretable, closed-form expressions that capture nonlinear dependencies and thresholding effects in Dst evolution.

Abstract: Genetic algorithms are highly effective optimization techniques for many computationally challenging problems, including combinatorial optimization tasks like portfolio optimization. Quantum computing has also shown potential in addressing these complex challenges. Combining these approaches, quantum genetic algorithms leverage the principles of superposition and entanglement to enhance the performance of classical genetic algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel quantum genetic algorithm introducing an innovative crossover strategy to generate quantum circuits from a binary solution. We incorporate a heuristic method to encode entanglement patterns from parent solutions into circuits for the next generation. Our algorithm advances quantum genetic algorithms by utilizing a limited number of entanglements, enabling efficient exploration of optimal solutions without significantly increasing circuit depth, making it suitable for near-term applications. We test this approach on a portfolio optimization problem using an IBM 127 qubits Eagle processor (ibm_quebec) and simulators. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, our results show that the proposed method improves fitness values by 33.6% over classical genetic algorithm and 37.2% over quantum-inspired genetic algorithm, using the same iteration counts and population sizes with real quantum hardware employing 100 qubits. These findings highlight the potential of current quantum computers to address real-world utility-scale combinatorial optimization problems.

The Low price, in particular, plays a crucial role in enhancing the forecast accuracy when used in combination with a Gated Recurrent Unit network and a baseline forecast. The study also finds that other Bitcoin-related features, apart from price data, have minimal impact on prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Bitcoin is one of the cryptocurrencies that is gaining more popularity in recent years. Previous studies have shown that closing price alone is not enough to forecast stock market series. We introduce a new set of time series and demonstrate that a subset is necessary to improve directional accuracy based on a machine learning ensemble. In our experiments, we study which time series and machine learning algorithms deliver the best results. We found that the most relevant time series that contribute to improving directional accuracy are Open, High and Low, with the largest contribution of Low in combination with an ensemble of Gated Recurrent Unit network and a baseline forecast. The relevance of other Bitcoin-related features that are not price-related is negligible. The proposed method delivers similar performance to the state-of-the-art when observing directional accuracy.

Summary:
Machine learning models are explored as replacements for a geochemical module in simulating reactive transport in porous media. Testing on a cation exchange problem reveals that while the surrogate models perform well in isolated predictions, they struggle with rollout predictions over successive time steps. By incorporating physics-based constraints and tailored dataset generation strategies, accurate rollout predictions are achieved. The study highlights the limitation of machine learning surrogates in predicting over multiple time steps, even for a simple sorption equilibrium reaction like the cation exchange problem. However, with the addition of physics-based modifications, these limitations can be overcome. The research provides a detailed analysis of these limitations and potential mitigation strategies.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Reactive transport in porous media plays a pivotal role in subsurface reservoir processes, influencing fluid properties and geochemical characteristics. However, coupling fluid flow and transport with geochemical reactions is computationally intensive, requiring geochemical calculations at each grid cell and each time step within a discretized simulation domain. Although recent advancements have integrated machine learning techniques as surrogates for geochemical simulations, ensuring computational efficiency and accuracy remains a challenge. This work investigates machine learning models as replacements for a geochemical module in a simulation of reactive transport in porous media. As a proof of concept, we test this approach on a well-documented cation exchange problem. While the surrogate models excel in isolated predictions, they fall short in rollout predictions over successive time steps. By introducing modifications, including physics-based constraints and tailored dataset generation strategies, we show that machine learning surrogates can achieve accurate rollout predictions. Our findings emphasize that even for a simple sorption equilibrium reaction (cation exchange problem), machine learning surrogates alone fail in predicting over successive time-steps. Incorporating simple physics-based modifications enables us to overcome this limitation. A detailed analysis of the limitations and potential mitigation strategies is presented in this work.

Summary:
The paper introduces function-coherent gambles, a generalization of the desirable gambles framework that allows for non-linear utility functions. Core axioms for function-coherence are established, and a representation theorem is proven, linking acceptable gambles to continuous linear functionals. The framework is then applied to analyze various forms of discounting in intertemporal choice, such as hyperbolic, quasi-hyperbolic, scale-dependent, and state-dependent discounting. The integration of these alternative discounting models within the function-coherent framework provides a unified treatment for modeling complex patterns of time preference. This approach bridges the gap between normative theory and real-world behavior in intertemporal decision-making under uncertainty, offering theoretical foundations for understanding sophisticated time preferences within the desirability paradigm. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The desirable gambles framework provides a foundational approach to imprecise probability theory but relies heavily on linear utility assumptions. This paper introduces function-coherent gambles, a generalization that accommodates non-linear utility while preserving essential rationality properties. We establish core axioms for function-coherence and prove a representation theorem that characterizes acceptable gambles through continuous linear functionals. The framework is then applied to analyze various forms of discounting in intertemporal choice, including hyperbolic, quasi-hyperbolic, scale-dependent, and state-dependent discounting. We demonstrate how these alternatives to constant-rate exponential discounting can be integrated within the function-coherent framework. This unified treatment provides theoretical foundations for modeling sophisticated patterns of time preference within the desirability paradigm, bridging a gap between normative theory and observed behavior in intertemporal decision-making under genuine uncertainty.

<div> Keywords: numerical algorithms, partial differential equations, entropy production inequality, turbulence models, k-epsilon model

Summary:
This article discusses the importance of incorporating nonlinear physical stability principles, such as the entropy production inequality, in the design of numerical algorithms for partial differential equations. By introducing space-time averaging and defining entropy variables, a symmetric system of advective-diffusive equations can be derived for turbulence models, including the k-epsilon model. Positivity and symmetry constraints are necessary for the turbulence diffusivity coefficients and source terms to ensure the design of entropy producing two-equation turbulence models. This approach emphasizes the use of physical principles over artificial viscosity for designing robust algorithms. <div>

Abstract: Consistency and stability are two essential ingredients in the design of numerical algorithms for partial differential equations. Robust algorithms can be developed by incorporating nonlinear physical stability principles in their design, such as the entropy production inequality (i.e., the Clausius-Duhem inequality or second law of thermodynamics), rather than by simply adding artificial viscosity (a common approach). This idea is applied to the k-epsilon and two-equation turbulence models by introducing space-time averaging. Then, a set of entropy variables can be defined which leads to a symmetric system of advective-diffusive equations. Positivity and symmetry of the equations require certain constraints on the turbulence diffusivity coefficients and the turbulence source terms. With these, we are able to design entropy producing two-equation turbulence models and, in particular, the k-epsilon model.

<div> Keywords: stock price forecasting, stock price prediction, PCIE model, tokenization method, multi-step prediction<br />
Summary: <br />
Effective stock price forecasting and prediction are essential for investors and policymakers but are challenging due to the dynamic nature of stock price data. Forecasting and prediction targets have distinct statistical characteristics and multi-step approaches provide richer information but are more difficult. The Patched Channel Integration Encoder (PCIE) model is introduced to address these challenges by utilizing multiple stock channels and a novel tokenization method. The tokenization process involves univariate patching and temporal learning to reduce cumulative errors. Experimental results demonstrate that PCIE outperforms current state-of-the-art models in both forecast and prediction tasks. <div>

Abstract: Effective stock price forecasting (estimating future prices) and prediction (estimating future price changes) are pivotal for investors, regulatory agencies, and policymakers. These tasks enable informed decision-making, risk management, strategic planning, and superior portfolio returns. Despite their importance, forecasting and prediction are challenging due to the dynamic nature of stock price data, which exhibit significant temporal variations in distribution and statistical properties. Additionally, while both forecasting and prediction targets are derived from the same dataset, their statistical characteristics differ significantly. Forecasting targets typically follow a log-normal distribution, characterized by significant shifts in mean and variance over time, whereas prediction targets adhere to a normal distribution. Furthermore, although multi-step forecasting and prediction offer a broader perspective and richer information compared to single-step approaches, it is much more challenging due to factors such as cumulative errors and long-term temporal variance. As a result, many previous works have tackled either single-step stock price forecasting or prediction instead. To address these issues, we introduce a novel model, termed Patched Channel Integration Encoder (PCIE), to tackle both stock price forecasting and prediction. In this model, we utilize multiple stock channels that cover both historical prices and price changes, and design a novel tokenization method to effectively embed these channels in a cross-channel and temporally efficient manner. Specifically, the tokenization process involves univariate patching and temporal learning with a channel-mixing encoder to reduce cumulative errors. Comprehensive experiments validate that PCIE outperforms current state-of-the-art models in forecast and prediction tasks.

Summary: 
This study presents a surrogate modeling framework for predicting the effective contact area in rough surface contact using fast-to-evaluate machine learning algorithms. The models are trained on a precomputed dataset of imposed load and roughness parameters to predict the effective contact area efficiently.

Abstract: The effective contact area in rough surface contact plays a critical role in multi-physics phenomena such as wear, sealing, and thermal or electrical conduction. Although accurate numerical methods, like the Boundary Element Method (BEM), are available to compute this quantity, their high computational cost limits their applicability in multi-query contexts, such as uncertainty quantification, parameter identification, and multi-scale algorithms, where many repeated evaluations are required. This study proposes a surrogate modeling framework for predicting the effective contact area using fast-to-evaluate data-driven techniques. Various machine learning algorithms are trained on a precomputed dataset, where the inputs are the imposed load and statistical roughness parameters, and the output is the corresponding effective contact area. All models undergo hyperparameter optimization to enable fair comparisons in terms of predictive accuracy and computational efficiency, evaluated using established quantitative metrics. Among the models, the Kernel Ridge Regressor demonstrates the best trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, achieving high predictive accuracy, low prediction time, and minimal training overhead-making it a strong candidate for general-purpose surrogate modeling. The Gaussian Process Regressor provides an attractive alternative when uncertainty quantification is required, although it incurs additional computational cost due to variance estimation. The generalization capability of the Kernel Ridge model is validated on an unseen simulation scenario, confirming its ability to transfer to new configurations. Database generation constitutes the dominant cost in the surrogate modeling process. Nevertheless, the approach proves practical and efficient for multi-query tasks, even when accounting for this initial expense.

Summary: 

polyGen is introduced as a novel approach to generating realistic polymer structures using a latent diffusion model. Leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer connectivity, polyGen can generate diverse conformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures. The model shows improvement in joint learning between similar chemical structures through training augmentation with DFT-optimized molecular structures. However, its performance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level structure generation for polymer science, providing the first proof-of-concept for predicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while considering their intrinsic structural flexibility. <div>

Abstract: Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges: on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect the conformational diversity of polymer structures. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first latent diffusion model designed specifically to generate realistic polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone, leveraging a molecular encoding that captures polymer connectivity throughout the architecture. Due to a scarce dataset of only 3855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we augment our training with DFT-optimized molecular structures, showing improvement in joint learning between similar chemical structures. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen effectively generates diverse conformations of both linear chains and complex branched structures, though its performance decreases when handling repeat units with a high atom count. Given these initial results, polyGen represents a paradigm shift in atomic-level structure generation for polymer science-the first proof-of-concept for predicting realistic atomic-level polymer conformations while accounting for their intrinsic structural flexibility.

<br />Summary: <br />
X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy is a valuable technique for analyzing chemical states in materials, but traditional data collection methods can be time-consuming. This study introduces a knowledge-injected Bayesian optimization approach for adaptive XANES data collection, taking into account spectral features like absorption edges and pre-edge peaks. The method efficiently reconstructs absorption edges with high accuracy using only 15-20% of the measurement points needed in conventional sampling. It can determine the x-ray energy of sharp peaks with minimal errors, achieving overall root-mean-square errors below 0.005 compared to traditional methods. The experiments on battery materials and catalysts demonstrate its effectiveness for both static and dynamic XANES measurements, enhancing data collection efficiency and enabling better time resolution for tracking chemical changes. This automated approach reduces common errors in XANES experiments and facilitates dynamic studies requiring high temporal resolution. <div>

Abstract: X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for characterizing the chemical state and symmetry of individual elements within materials, but requires collecting data at many energy points which can be time-consuming. While adaptive sampling methods exist for efficiently collecting spectroscopic data, they often lack domain-specific knowledge about XANES spectra structure. Here we demonstrate a knowledge-injected Bayesian optimization approach for adaptive XANES data collection that incorporates understanding of spectral features like absorption edges and pre-edge peaks. We show this method accurately reconstructs the absorption edge of XANES spectra using only 15-20% of the measurement points typically needed for conventional sampling, while maintaining the ability to determine the x-ray energy of the sharp peak after absorption edge with errors less than 0.03 eV, the absorption edge with errors less than 0.1 eV; and overall root-mean-square errors less than 0.005 compared to compared to traditionally sampled spectra. Our experiments on battery materials and catalysts demonstrate the method's effectiveness for both static and dynamic XANES measurements, improving data collection efficiency and enabling better time resolution for tracking chemical changes. This approach advances the degree of automation in XANES experiments reducing the common errors of under- or over-sampling points in near the absorption edge and enabling dynamic experiments that require high temporal resolution or limited measurement time.

Summary:
This study focuses on using reinforcement learning techniques for designing microelectronic components under multiphysics constraints. Traditional global optimization approaches are limited when dealing with intricate solution spaces and constraints. The complexity of microelectronic component design, such as ASICs and HI interposers, poses challenges for conventional methods. The study explores optimizing interconnect geometry for ASIC chips and component placement on a HI interposer while meeting thermoelastic and design constraints. The placement problem involves a high-dimensional solution space, highlighting the need for advanced techniques like reinforcement learning. By developing and testing an RL-based framework, the study aims to enhance the design and optimization processes for microelectronic components with multiphysics constraints. <div>

Abstract: This study focuses on the development of reinforcement learning based techniques for the design of microelectronic components under multiphysics constraints. While traditional design approaches based on global optimization approaches are effective when dealing with a small number of design parameters, as the complexity of the solution space and of the constraints increases different techniques are needed. This is an important reason that makes the design and optimization of microelectronic components (characterized by large solution space and multiphysics constraints) very challenging for traditional methods. By taking as prototypical elements an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and a heterogeneously integrated (HI) interposer, we develop and numerically test an optimization framework based on reinforcement learning (RL). More specifically, we consider the optimization of the bonded interconnect geometry for an ASIC chip as well as the placement of components on a HI interposer while satisfying thermoelastic and design constraints. This placement problem is particularly interesting because it features a high-dimensional solution space.

The study introduces Aging Debt (AD) as a concept to represent increased maintenance efforts in software. It focuses on Self-Admitted Aging Debt (SAAD) observed in source code comments to detect and measure AD in software. A taxonomy is developed to categorize temporal software aging into Active and Dormant types. Analysis of over 9,000+ OSS repositories shows that more than 21% exhibit SAAD, with Dormant AD being prevalent. The study highlights the critical aspect of software maintenance and the importance of addressing evolutionary indicators like source code comments in software aging research. The proposed taxonomy can assist researchers in detailed software aging studies and help practitioners in developing proactive maintenance strategies. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Context: Previous research on software aging is limited with focus on dynamic runtime indicators like memory and performance, often neglecting evolutionary indicators like source code comments and narrowly examining legacy issues within the TD context. Objective: We introduce the concept of Aging Debt (AD), representing the increased maintenance efforts and costs needed to keep software updated. We study AD through Self-Admitted Aging Debt (SAAD) observed in source code comments left by software developers. Method: We employ a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analyses to detect and measure AD in software. This includes framing SAAD patterns from the source code comments after analysing the source code context, then utilizing the SAAD patterns to detect SAAD comments. In the process, we develop a taxonomy for SAAD that reflects the temporal aging of software and its associated debt. Then we utilize the taxonomy to quantify the different types of AD prevalent in OSS repositories. Results: Our proposed taxonomy categorizes temporal software aging into Active and Dormant types. Our extensive analysis of over 9,000+ Open Source Software (OSS) repositories reveals that more than 21% repositories exhibit signs of SAAD as observed from our gold standard SAAD dataset. Notably, Dormant AD emerges as the predominant category, highlighting a critical but often overlooked aspect of software maintenance. Conclusion: As software volume grows annually, so do evolutionary aging and maintenance challenges; our proposed taxonomy can aid researchers in detailed software aging studies and help practitioners develop improved and proactive maintenance strategies.

Abstract: The train timetabling problem in liberalized railway markets represents a challenge to the coordination between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings. Efficient scheduling is critical in maximizing infrastructure capacity and utilization while adhering as closely as possible to the requests of railway undertakings. These objectives ultimately contribute to maximizing the infrastructure manager's revenues. This paper sets out a modular simulation framework to reproduce the dynamics of deregulated railway systems. Ten metaheuristic algorithms using the MEALPY Python library are then evaluated in order to optimize train schedules in the liberalized Spanish railway market. The results show that the Genetic Algorithm outperforms others in revenue optimization, convergence speed, and schedule adherence. Alternatives, such as Particle Swarm Optimization and Ant Colony Optimization Continuous, show slower convergence and higher variability. The results emphasize the trade-off between scheduling more trains and adhering to requested times, providing insights into solving complex scheduling problems in deregulated railway systems.

Summary: 
In the changing landscape of European rail transport due to liberalization, railway undertakings now compete for limited infrastructure capacity to offer their services. The equitable allocation of infrastructure by the infrastructure manager is crucial for the efficiency and sustainability of this competitive environment. A methodology utilizing Jain, Gini, and Atkinson equity metrics is proposed to address the rail service allocation problem in a liberalized railway market. The results from computational tests demonstrate that this methodology promotes equitable planning across various competitiveness scenarios. This stands in contrast to approaches solely focused on maximizing the infrastructure manager's profit without considering fair allocation. The study supports the use of the proposed methodology and equity metrics as effective tools for planning and decision-making within a liberalized railway market.

Abstract: Over the last few decades, European rail transport has undergone major changes as part of the process of liberalization set out in European regulations. In this context of liberalization, railway undertakings compete with each other for the limited infrastructure capacity available to offer their rail services. The infrastructure manager is responsible for the equitable allocation of infrastructure between all companies in the market, which is essential to ensure the efficiency and sustainability of this competitive ecosystem. In this paper, a methodology based on Jain, Gini and Atkinson equity metrics is used to solve the rail service allocation problem in a liberalized railway market, analyzing the solutions obtained. The results show that the proposed methodology and the equity metrics used allow for equitable planning in different competitiveness scenarios. These results contrast with solutions where the objective of the infrastructure manager is to maximize its own profit, without regard for the equitable allocation of infrastructure. Therefore, the computational tests support the methodology and metrics used as a planning and decision support tool in a liberalized railway market.

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding complexes are ubiquitous and essential to life. Protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (PLA) quantifies the binding strength between ligands and proteins, providing crucial insights for discovering and designing potential candidate ligands. While recent advances have been made in predicting protein-ligand complex structures, existing algorithms for interaction and affinity prediction suffer from a sharp decline in performance when handling ligands bound with novel unseen proteins. We propose IPBind, a geometric deep learning-based computational method, enabling robust predictions by leveraging interatomic potential between complex's bound and unbound status. Experimental results on widely used binding affinity prediction benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of IPBind. Meanwhile, it provides atom-level insights into prediction. This work highlights the advantage of leveraging machine learning interatomic potential for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity.

Abstract: This paper compares different Transformer model architectures for stock index prediction. While many studies have shown that Transformers perform well in stock price forecasting, few have explored how different structural designs impact performance. Most existing works treat the Transformer as a black box, overlooking how specific architectural choices may affect predictive accuracy. However, understanding these differences is critical for developing more effective forecasting models. This study aims to identify which Transformer variant is most suitable for stock forecasting. This study evaluates five Transformer structures: (1) encoder-only Transformer, (2) decoder-only Transformer, (3) Vanilla Transformer (encoder + decoder), (4) Vanilla Transformer without embedding layers, and (5) Vanilla Transformer with ProbSparse attention. Results show that Transformer-based models generally outperform traditional approaches. Transformer with decoder only structure outperforms all other models in all scenarios. Transformer with ProbSparse attention has the worst performance in almost all cases.

Summary: <br />
The optimization of parametric quantum circuits faces challenges due to the non-convex nature of the objective function, noisy gradient evaluations, and barren plateaus. Selecting the right classical optimizer is crucial in quantum-classical applications. Incorporating curvature information in the parameter update can aid in faster convergence. Quasi-Newton and quantum natural gradient methods show promise in this regard but have drawbacks. A study evaluates the performance of optimizers on MaxCut problems using a shallow QAOA algorithm. To address noise sensitivity and iteration cost, a novel approach called secant-penalization in the BFGS update rule (SP-BFGS) is introduced, leading to improved outcomes for QAOA optimization problems. This method stabilizes BFGS updates against gradient noise, showcasing potential for optimizing parametric quantum circuits in noisy environments. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2504.16518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization of parametric quantum circuits is technically hindered by three major obstacles: the non-convex nature of the objective function, noisy gradient evaluations, and the presence of barren plateaus. As a result, the selection of classical optimizer becomes a critical factor in assessing and exploiting quantum-classical applications. One promising approach to tackle these challenges involves incorporating curvature information into the parameter update. The most prominent methods in this field are quasi-Newton and quantum natural gradient methods, which can facilitate faster convergence compared to first-order approaches. Second order methods however exhibit a significant trade-off between computational cost and accuracy, as well as heightened sensitivity to noise. This study evaluates the performance of three families of optimizers on synthetically generated MaxCut problems on a shallow QAOA algorithm. To address noise sensitivity and iteration cost, we demonstrate that incorporating secant-penalization in the BFGS update rule (SP-BFGS) yields improved outcomes for QAOA optimization problems, introducing a novel approach to stabilizing BFGS updates against gradient noise.

Abstract: Safety assessment of patients with one-dimensionally structured passive implants, like cranial plates or stents, exposed to low or medium frequency magnetic fields, like those generated in magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic hyperthermia, can be challenging, because of the different length scales of the implant and the human body. Most of the methods used to estimate the heating induced near such implants neglect the presence of the metallic materials within the body, modeling the metal as thermal seeds. To overcome this limitation, a novel numerical approach that solves three-dimensional and one-dimensional coupled problems is proposed. This method leads to improved results by modelling the thermal diffusion through the highly conductive metallic implants. A comparison of the proposed method predictions with measurements performed on a cranial plate exposed to the magnetic field generated by a gradient coil system for magnetic resonance imaging is presented, showing an improved accuracy up to 25 % with respect to the method based on thermal seeds. The proposed method is finally applied to a magnetic hyperthermia case study in which a patient with a cranial plate is exposed to the magnetic field generated by a collar-type magnetic hyperthermia applicator for neck tumour treatment, predicting a temperature increase in proximity of the implant that is 10 % lower than the one overestimated by relying on thermal seeds.

We explored publication trends, categorized them based on software engineering topics, and reported findings based on those topics.
  Results: The most popular venues for publishing software engineering research on Jupyter notebooks are related to human-computer interaction instead of traditional software engineering venues. Researchers have addressed a wide range of software engineering topics on notebooks, such as code reuse, readability, and execution environment. Although reusability is one of the research topics for Jupyter notebooks, only 64 of the 146 studies can be reused based on their provided URLs. Additionally, most replication packages are not hosted on permanent repositories for long-term availability and adherence to open science principles.
  Conclusion: Solutions specific to notebooks for software engineering issues, including testing, refactoring, and documentation, are underexplored. Future research opportunities exist in automatic testing frameworks, refactoring clones between notebooks, and generating group documentation for coherent code cells.

<div> Keywords: Transformer, Softmax, Sinkhorn algorithm, doubly stochastic matrix, variational quantum circuit <br />
Summary: 
The study introduces a hybrid classical-quantum Doubly Stochastic Transformer (QDSFormer) that incorporates a variational quantum circuit in place of the Softmax in the attention layer of the Transformer model. The parametric quantum circuit used in the QDSFormer enhances the expressive power of the model, resulting in more diverse Doubly Stochastic Matrices (DSMs) that preserve information better than classical operators. Through experiments on small-scale object recognition tasks, the QDSFormer outperforms standard Vision Transformers and other doubly stochastic Transformers. Additionally, a quantum-inspired doubly stochastic Transformer based on QR decomposition is also compared. The QDSFormer demonstrates improved training stability and lower performance variation, suggesting that it could mitigate instability during training on small-scale data. These findings highlight the potential of quantum-inspired approaches in enhancing the performance and stability of Transformer models.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2504.16275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At the core of the Transformer, the Softmax normalizes the attention matrix to be right stochastic. Previous research has shown that this often destabilizes training and that enforcing the attention matrix to be doubly stochastic (through Sinkhorn's algorithm) consistently improves performance across different tasks, domains and Transformer flavors. However, Sinkhorn's algorithm is iterative, approximative, non-parametric and thus inflexible w.r.t. the obtained doubly stochastic matrix (DSM). Recently, it has been proven that DSMs can be obtained with a parametric quantum circuit, yielding a novel quantum inductive bias for DSMs with no known classical analogue. Motivated by this, we demonstrate the feasibility of a hybrid classical-quantum doubly stochastic Transformer (QDSFormer) that replaces the Softmax in the self-attention layer with a variational quantum circuit. We study the expressive power of the circuit and find that it yields more diverse DSMs that better preserve information than classical operators. Across multiple small-scale object recognition tasks, we find that our QDSFormer consistently surpasses both a standard Vision Transformer and other doubly stochastic Transformers. Beyond the established Sinkformer, this comparison includes a novel quantum-inspired doubly stochastic Transformer (based on QR decomposition) that can be of independent interest. The QDSFormer also shows improved training stability and lower performance variation suggesting that it may mitigate the notoriously unstable training of ViTs on small-scale data.

Summary:
This article presents an adaptive mixture approach for accelerating multiscale models using data-driven surrogate modeling techniques. The approach involves using a fast probabilistic surrogate model for most of the computational domain, switching to the true high-fidelity model only when necessary. By incorporating phases in the computational domain and utilizing a phase-field model driven by surrogate uncertainty, the transition between models is smooth and accurate. The method reduces the time required to collect a large training dataset, while still maintaining high accuracy in simulations. The study compares this approach to a purely local model and demonstrates its effectiveness using a Gaussian Process surrogate for an elasto-plastic material. The adaptive mixture of models shows great potential for speeding up multiscale simulations without compromising accuracy or stability. <br /> <div>

Abstract: There is a high interest in accelerating multiscale models using data-driven surrogate modeling techniques. Creating a large training dataset encompassing all relevant load scenarios is essential for a good surrogate, yet the computational cost of producing this data quickly becomes a limiting factor. Commonly, a pre-trained surrogate is used throughout the computational domain. Here, we introduce an alternative adaptive mixture approach that uses a fast probabilistic surrogate model as constitutive model when possible, but resorts back to the true high-fidelity model when necessary. The surrogate is thus not required to be accurate for every possible load condition, enabling a significant reduction in the data collection time. We achieve this by creating phases in the computational domain corresponding to the different models. These phases evolve using a phase-field model driven by the surrogate uncertainty. When the surrogate uncertainty becomes large, the phase-field model causes a local transition from the surrogate to the high-fidelity model, maintaining a highly accurate simulation. We discuss the requirements of this approach to achieve accurate and numerically stable results and compare the phase-field model to a purely local approach that does not enforce spatial smoothness for the phase mixing. Using a Gaussian Process surrogate for an elasto-plastic material, we demonstrate the potential of this mixture of models to accelerate multiscale simulations.

Summary:
Interlaced Characterization and Calibration (ICC) presents an improved workflow for material model calibration, addressing current limitations. It efficiently uses full-field data for calibration, aligns collected data with optimal experimental design, quantifies parameter uncertainty through Bayesian inference, and incorporates a real-time feedback loop. Demonstrated on an aluminum cruciform specimen, ICC utilizes Bayesian optimal experimental design for selecting load steps, principal component analysis for reducing data dimensions, and fast surrogate models for computational efficiency. This framework allows for reliable calibration of high-fidelity constitutive models with quantified uncertainty. By advancing the state-of-the-art in material characterization and model calibration, ICC supports credible decision-making in solid mechanics modeling, potentially increasing modeling agility.

Abstract: Accurate material characterization and model calibration are essential for computationally-supported engineering decisions. Current characterization and calibration methods (1) use simplified test specimen geometries and global data, (2) cannot guarantee that sufficient characterization data is collected for a specific model of interest, (3) use deterministic methods that provide best-fit parameter values with no uncertainty quantification, and (4) are sequential, inflexible, and time-consuming. This work brings together several recent advancements into an improved workflow called Interlaced Characterization and Calibration that advances the state-of-the-art in constitutive model calibration. The ICC paradigm (1) efficiently uses full-field data to calibrate a high-fidelity material model, (2) aligns the data needed with the data collected with an optimal experimental design protocol, (3) quantifies parameter uncertainty through Bayesian inference, and (4) incorporates these advances into a quasi real-time feedback loop. The ICC framework is demonstrated on the calibration of a material model using simulated full-field data for an aluminum cruciform specimen being deformed bi-axially. The cruciform is actively driven through the myopically optimal load path using Bayesian optimal experimental design, which selects load steps that yield the maximum expected information gain. To aid in numerical stability and preserve computational resources, the full-field data is dimensionally reduced via principal component analysis, and fast surrogate models which approximate the input-output relationships of the expensive finite element model are used. The tools demonstrated here show that high-fidelity constitutive models can be efficiently and reliably calibrated with quantified uncertainty, thus supporting credible decision-making and potentially increasing the agility of solid mechanics modeling.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach to enhance the generalizability of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by incorporating principles of Baldwinian evolution. The proposed Baldwinian-PINNs are pre-wired with connection strengths to enable efficient learning of physics tasks. By utilizing a two-stage stochastic programming formulation that combines evolutionary selection pressure and lifetime learning, these evolved PINNs exhibit fast and accurate predictions across various physics problems. The Baldwinian-PINNs outperform state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning methods by achieving over a 70x improvement in accuracy while requiring 700x less computational time when solving the diffusion-reaction equation. This research marks a significant advancement in meta-learning for PINNs, providing a more generalizable and efficient approach to solving complex physics simulations. Sample codes for implementation are available on GitHub for further exploration.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are at the forefront of scientific machine learning, making possible the creation of machine intelligence that is cognizant of physical laws and able to accurately simulate them. However, today's PINNs are often trained for a single physics task and require computationally expensive re-training for each new task, even for tasks from similar physics domains. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a pioneering approach to advance the generalizability of PINNs through the framework of Baldwinian evolution. Drawing inspiration from the neurodevelopment of precocial species that have evolved to learn, predict and react quickly to their environment, we envision PINNs that are pre-wired with connection strengths inducing strong biases towards efficient learning of physics. A novel two-stage stochastic programming formulation coupling evolutionary selection pressure (based on proficiency over a distribution of physics tasks) with lifetime learning (to specialize on a sampled subset of those tasks) is proposed to instantiate the Baldwin effect. The evolved Baldwinian-PINNs demonstrate fast and physics-compliant prediction capabilities across a range of empirically challenging problem instances with more than an order of magnitude improvement in prediction accuracy at a fraction of the computation cost compared to state-of-the-art gradient-based meta-learning methods. For example, when solving the diffusion-reaction equation, a 70x improvement in accuracy was obtained while taking 700x less computational time. This paper thus marks a leap forward in the meta-learning of PINNs as generalizable physics solvers. Sample codes are available at https://github.com/chiuph/Baldwinian-PINN.

Abstract: In this contribution, we present a novel consistent dual-stage approach for the automated generation of hyperelastic constitutive models which only requires experimentally measurable data. To generate input data for our approach, an experiment with full-field measurement has to be conducted to gather testing force and corresponding displacement field of the sample. Then, in the first step of the dual-stage framework, a new finite strain Data-Driven Identification (DDI) formulation is applied. This method enables to identify tuples consisting of stresses and strains by only prescribing the applied boundary conditions and the measured displacement field. In the second step, the data set is used to calibrate a Physics-Augmented Neural Network (PANN), which fulfills all common conditions of hyperelasticity by construction and is very flexible at the same time. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach by several descriptive examples. Two-dimensional synthetic data are exemplarily generated in virtual experiments by using a reference constitutive model. The calibrated PANN is then applied in 3D Finite Element simulations. In addition, a real experiment including noisy data is mimicked.

<div> Wave equations, adaptive mesh refinement, ExaHyPE, ExaGRyPE, interpolation schemes<br />
Summary:<br />
Wave equations play an essential role in understanding various phenomena, but tracking them over regular meshes is computationally challenging given their large scales. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) helps by creating higher-resolution meshes near regions of interest. ExaHyPE and ExaGRyPE are software engines developed to solve wave problems using AMR. To advance the mesh in time, a set of higher-order interpolation schemes was introduced to address errors near AMR boundaries and improve computational efficiency. By calculating derivatives at each coarse grid cell to approximate fine cells, these new methods outperform the traditional tensor-product approach in terms of speed and accuracy. This improvement was demonstrated in a benchmark simulation of a stationary black hole, where the errors near AMR boundaries were eliminated. <div>
arXiv:2504.15814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave equations help us to understand phenomena ranging from earthquakes to tsunamis. These phenomena materialise over very large scales. It would be computationally infeasible to track them over a regular mesh. Yet, since the phenomena are localised, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) can be used to construct meshes with a higher resolution close to the regions of interest. ExaHyPE is a software engine created to solve wave problems using AMR, and we use it as baseline to construct our numerical relativity application called ExaGRyPE. To advance the mesh in time, we have to interpolate and restrict along resolution transitions in each and every time step. ExaHyPE's vanilla code version uses a d-linear tensor-product approach. In benchmarks of a stationary black hole this performs slowly and leads to errors in conserved quantities near AMR boundaries. We therefore introduce a set of higher-order interpolation schemes where the derivatives are calculated at each coarse grid cell to approximate the enclosed fine cells. The resulting methods run faster than the tensor-product approach. Most importantly, when running the stationary black hole simulation using the higher order methods the errors near the AMR boundaries are removed.

Summary:
Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are a serious health concern, particularly among older individuals, due to their potential for life-threatening rupture. The geometric characteristics of AAAs, such as maximum diameter and wall thickness, are vital for assessing rupture risk. However, there is a lack of open-source software for generating simulation-ready AAA geometries. AneuPy, a Python-based tool, addresses this gap by automating the generation of idealized and patient-specific AAA geometrical models with minimal input data. By facilitating the creation of simulation-ready geometries for biomechanical and hemodynamic analyses, AneuPy aims to enhance research in AAA and improve patient-specific risk assessment. Its efficiency and flexibility make it a valuable tool for modeling AAA using finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), or fluid-structure interaction (FSI) methods. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are localized dilations of the abdominal aorta that can lead to life-threatening rupture if left untreated. AAAs predominantly affect older individuals, with a high mortality rate upon rupture, making early diagnosis and risk assessment critical. The geometric characteristics of an AAA, such as its maximum diameter, asymmetry, and wall thickness, play a crucial role in biomechanical models used to assess rupture risk. Despite the growing use of computational modeling to study AAAs, there is a lack of open source software that facilitates the generation of simulation-ready geometries tailored for biomechanical and hemodynamic analyses. To address this need, we introduce AneuPy, an open-source Python-based tool designed to generate idealized and patient-specific AAA geometrical models. AneuPy provides an efficient and automated approach to aneurysm geometry generation, requiring minimal input data while allowing for flexible parameterization. By streamlining the creation of simulation-ready geometries for finite element analysis (FEA), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), or fluid-structure interaction (FSI) models, AneuPy aims to facilitate research in AAAs and enhance patient-specific risk assessment.

Summary: 
This article introduces a physics-aware in-situ compression method using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for large-scale plasma simulations. By approximating electron and ion velocity distribution functions with GMMs, the method captures plasma features like mean velocity and temperature, enabling identification of heating processes and beam generation. The approach involves constructing a histogram to reduce computational overhead and implementing GPU-accelerated, in-situ GMM fitting within the iPIC3D simulator for real-time compression. The compressed representation is stored using the ADIOS 2 library to optimize the I/O process. Compared to other algorithms like SZ, MGARD, and BLOSC2, the GMM-based method retains a physics-based approach, preserving the physical interpretation of plasma phenomena while achieving compression ratios of up to $10^4 and processing times comparable to standard compression engines. <div>

Abstract: Data compression is a critical technology for large-scale plasma simulations. Storing complete particle information requires Terabyte-scale data storage, and analysis requires ad-hoc scalable post-processing tools. We propose a physics-aware in-situ compression method using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to approximate electron and ion velocity distribution functions with a number of Gaussian components. This GMM-based method allows us to capture plasma features such as mean velocity and temperature, and it enables us to identify heating processes and generate beams. We first construct a histogram to reduce computational overhead and apply GPU-accelerated, in-situ GMM fitting within \texttt{iPIC3D}, a large-scale implicit Particle-in-Cell simulator, ensuring real-time compression. The compressed representation is stored using the \texttt{ADIOS 2} library, thus optimizing the I/O process. The GPU and histogramming implementation provides a significant speed-up with respect to GMM on particles (both in time and required memory at run-time), enabling real-time compression. Compared to algorithms like SZ, MGARD, and BLOSC2, our GMM-based method has a physics-based approach, retaining the physical interpretation of plasma phenomena such as beam formation, acceleration, and heating mechanisms. Our GMM algorithm achieves a compression ratio of up to $10^4$, requiring a processing time comparable to, or even lower than, standard compression engines.

Abstract: Motivated by the large-scale nature of modern aerospace engineering simulations, this paper presents a detailed description of distributed Operator Inference (dOpInf), a recently developed parallel algorithm designed to efficiently construct physics-based reduced-order models (ROMs) for problems with large state dimensions. One such example is the simulation of rotating detonation rocket engines, where snapshot data generated by high-fidelity large-eddy simulations have many millions of degrees of freedom. dOpInf enables, via distributed computing, the efficient processing of datasets with state dimensions that are too large to process on a single computer, and the learning of structured physics-based ROMs that approximate the dynamical systems underlying those datasets. All elements of dOpInf are scalable, leading to a fully parallelized reduced modeling approach that can scale to the thousands of processors available on leadership high-performance computing platforms. The resulting ROMs are computationally cheap, making them ideal for key engineering tasks such as design space exploration, risk assessment, and uncertainty quantification. To illustrate the practical application of dOpInf, we provide a step-by-step tutorial using a 2D Navier-Stokes flow over a step scenario as a case study. This tutorial guides users through the implementation process, making dOpInf accessible for integration into complex aerospace engineering simulations.

EducationQ is a multi-agent dialogue framework designed to assess the teaching capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Evaluating 14 LLMs from major AI organizations, the study found that teaching effectiveness does not solely rely on model scale or general reasoning abilities. Smaller open-source models sometimes outperformed larger commercial ones in educational contexts. The research highlighted a gap in current evaluations that prioritize knowledge recall over interactive pedagogy. Through a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative metrics, qualitative analysis, and expert case studies, distinct pedagogical strengths of top-performing models were identified. Human expert evaluations supported the automated qualitative analysis of effective teaching behaviors. The study suggests that LLMs-as-teachers require specialized optimization beyond simple scaling, indicating a need for targeted enhancement of specific pedagogical effectiveness in future educational AI development.<br />

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as educational tools, yet evaluating their teaching capabilities remains challenging due to the resource-intensive, context-dependent, and methodologically complex nature of teacher-student interactions. We introduce EducationQ, a multi-agent dialogue framework that efficiently assesses teaching capabilities through simulated dynamic educational scenarios, featuring specialized agents for teaching, learning, and evaluation. Testing 14 LLMs across major AI Organizations (OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic, and others) on 1,498 questions spanning 13 disciplines and 10 difficulty levels reveals that teaching effectiveness does not correlate linearly with model scale or general reasoning capabilities - with some smaller open-source models outperforming larger commercial counterparts in teaching contexts. This finding highlights a critical gap in current evaluations that prioritize knowledge recall over interactive pedagogy. Our mixed-methods evaluation, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis and expert case studies, identifies distinct pedagogical strengths employed by top-performing models (e.g., sophisticated questioning strategies, adaptive feedback mechanisms). Human expert evaluations show 78% agreement with our automated qualitative analysis of effective teaching behaviors, validating our methodology. EducationQ demonstrates that LLMs-as-teachers require specialized optimization beyond simple scaling, suggesting next-generation educational AI prioritize targeted enhancement of specific pedagogical effectiveness.

Abstract: Speaker identification using voice recordings leverages unique acoustic features, but this approach fails when only textual data is available. Few approaches have attempted to tackle the problem of identifying speakers solely from text, and the existing ones have primarily relied on traditional methods. In this work, we explore the use of fuzzy fingerprints from large pre-trained models to improve text-based speaker identification. We integrate speaker-specific tokens and context-aware modeling, demonstrating that conversational context significantly boosts accuracy, reaching 70.6% on the Friends dataset and 67.7% on the Big Bang Theory dataset. Additionally, we show that fuzzy fingerprints can approximate full fine-tuning performance with fewer hidden units, offering improved interpretability. Finally, we analyze ambiguous utterances and propose a mechanism to detect speaker-agnostic lines. Our findings highlight key challenges and provide insights for future improvements in text-based speaker identification.

This deployment, called the Industrial Metaverse, is used for product design, production operations, industrial quality inspection, and product testing. However, there lacks of in-depth understanding of the enabling technologies associated with the Industrial Metaverse. This encompasses both the precise industrial scenarios targeted by each technology and the potential migration of technologies developed in other domains to the industrial sector. Driven by this issue, in this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art literature on the Industrial Metaverse. Specifically, we first analyze the advantages of the Metaverse for industrial production. Then, we review a collection of key enabling technologies of the Industrial Metaverse, including blockchain (BC), digital twin (DT), 6G, XR, and artificial intelligence (AI), and analyze how these technologies can support different aspects of industrial production. Subsequently, we present numerous formidable challenges encountered within the Industrial Metaverse, including confidentiality and security concerns, resource limitations, and interoperability constraints. Furthermore, we investigate the extant solutions devised to address them. Finally, we briefly outline several open issues and future research directions of the Industrial Metaverse.

<div> Optimization-based coupling, Lagrange multiplier, multiple modeling, simulation, reduced order models<br />
<br />
Summary: Optimization-based coupling (OBC) offers a promising approach in various modeling and simulation scenarios but faces challenges in time-dependent problems due to computational costs. This paper introduces an optimization-based ROM-ROM coupling for a transient advection-diffusion transmission issue, utilizing reduced order models to alleviate computational burdens. The "optimize-then-reduce" strategy is employed to solve the minimization problem at each time step efficiently. A key innovation is the development of a technique for effective adjoint snapshot collection for gradient-based optimizers in the context of optimization-based ROM-ROM couplings. Numerical experiments validate the accuracy of the proposed approach while comparing different methods for selecting reduced order bases for adjoint systems. Criteria such as decay of snapshot energy, average iteration counts, and timings are assessed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the optimization-based ROM-ROM coupling. <div>

Abstract: Optimization-based coupling (OBC) is an attractive alternative to traditional Lagrange multiplier approaches in multiple modeling and simulation contexts. However, application of OBC to time-dependent problems has been hindered by the computational cost of finding the stationary points of the associated Lagrangian, which requires primal and adjoint solves. This issue can be mitigated by using OBC in conjunction with computationally efficient reduced order models (ROM). To demonstrate the potential of this combination, in this paper we develop an optimization-based ROM-ROM coupling for a transient advection-diffusion transmission problem. We pursue the ``optimize-then-reduce'' path towards solving the minimization problem at each timestep and solve reduced-space adjoint system of equations, where the main challenge in this formulation is the generation of adjoint snapshots and reduced bases for the adjoint systems required by the optimizer. One of the main contributions of the paper is a new technique for efficient adjoint snapshot collection for gradient-based optimizers in the context of optimization-based ROM-ROM couplings. We present numerical studies demonstrating the accuracy of the approach along with comparison between various approaches for selecting a reduced order basis for the adjoint systems, including decay of snapshot energy, average iteration counts, and timings.

Abstract: Cardiac action potential models allow examination of a variety of cardiac dynamics, including how behavior may change under specific interventions. To study a specific scenario, including patient-specific cases, model parameter sets must be found that accurately reproduce the dynamics of interest. To facilitate this complex and time-consuming process, we present an interactive browser-based tool that uses the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm implemented in JavaScript and taking advantage of the WebGL API for hardware acceleration. Our tool allows rapid customization and can find low-error fittings to user-provided voltage time series or action potential duration data from multiple cycle lengths in a few iterations (10-32), corresponding to a runtime of a few seconds on most machines. Additionally, our tool focuses on ease of use and flexibility, providing a webpage interface that allows users to select a subset of parameters to fit, set the range of values each parameter is allowed to assume, and control the PSO algorithm hyperparameters. We demonstrate our tool's utility by fitting a variety of models to different datasets, showing how convergence is affected by model choice, dataset properties, and PSO algorithmic settings, and explaining new insights gained about the physiological and dynamical roles of the model parameters.

<div> Keywords: Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis, Financial Predictions

Summary:
Blockchain technology is not only used for financial transactions but also for storing and sharing non-financial content. This hidden content can impact cryptocurrency price movements by conveying private information and shaping public sentiment. Current methods of analyzing blockchain data are limited, prompting the use of Natural Language Processing techniques to extract sentiment from transactional data. The study demonstrates the predictive power of blockchain-embedded sentiment in forecasting cryptocurrency prices on Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. It uncovers an informational advantage for Bitcoin over Ethereum, showing that sentiment analysis can effectively predict price movements. This research highlights the value of blockchain sentiment analysis in enhancing financial predictions within cryptocurrency markets, providing a novel framework for leveraging freely available, transparent, and immutable data for informed decision-making in the digital asset space.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency blockchains, beyond their primary role as distributed payment systems, are increasingly used to store and share arbitrary content, such as text messages and files. Although often non-financial, this hidden content can impact price movements by conveying private information, shaping sentiment, and influencing public opinion. However, current analyses of such data are limited in scope and scalability, primarily relying on manual classification or hand-crafted heuristics. In this work, we address these limitations by employing Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze, detect patterns, and extract public sentiment encoded within blockchain transactional data. Using a variety of Machine Learning techniques, we showcase for the first time the predictive power of blockchain-embedded sentiment in forecasting cryptocurrency price movements on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains. Our findings shed light on a previously underexplored source of freely available, transparent, and immutable data and introduce blockchain sentiment analysis as a novel and robust framework for enhancing financial predictions in cryptocurrency markets. Incidentally, we discover an asymmetry between cryptocurrencies; Bitcoin has an informational advantage over Ethereum in that the sentiment embedded into transactional data is sufficient to predict its price movement.

Abstract: Accurate real-time modeling of multi-body dynamical systems is essential for enabling digital twin applications across industries. While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.

Abstract: Financial prediction is a complex and challenging task of time series analysis and signal processing, expected to model both short-term fluctuations and long-term temporal dependencies. Transformers have remarkable success mostly in natural language processing using attention mechanism, which also influenced the time series community. The ability to capture both short and long-range dependencies helps to understand the financial market and to recognize price patterns, leading to successful applications of Transformers in stock prediction. Although, the previous research predominantly focuses on individual features and singular predictions, that limits the model's ability to understand broader market trends. In reality, within sectors such as finance and technology, companies belonging to the same industry often exhibit correlated stock price movements.
  In this paper, we develop a novel neural network architecture by integrating Time2Vec with the Encoder of the Transformer model. Based on the study of different markets, we propose a novel correlation feature selection method. Through a comprehensive fine-tuning of multiple hyperparameters, we conduct a comparative analysis of our results against benchmark models. We conclude that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art encoding methods such as positional encoding, and we also conclude that selecting correlation features enhance the accuracy of predicting multiple stock prices.

Summary: 
The article presents a new numerical algorithm for evaluating the reflection coefficient of an antenna in the presence of a planar layered medium. This algorithm utilizes the antenna's generalized scattering matrix (GSM) to model the interaction between the antenna and the medium through spherical-to-planar vector wave transformations. By avoiding approximations that could compromise accuracy, the algorithm reduces algebraic complexity and significantly speeds up antenna performance evaluation. While a one-time preprocessing cost is required to obtain the antenna's GSM in free space, the numerical evaluation speed of this method surpasses that of commercial software FEKO by several orders of magnitude, maintaining high accuracy. This advancement in computational efficiency offers a promising approach for accurately evaluating antenna performance in complex scenarios involving layered media.

Abstract: Engineering problems that apply machine learning often involve computationally intensive methods but rely on limited datasets. As engineering data evolves with new designs and constraints, models must incorporate new knowledge over time. However, high computational costs make retraining models from scratch infeasible. Continual learning (CL) offers a promising solution by enabling models to learn from sequential data while mitigating catastrophic forgetting, where a model forgets previously learned mappings. This work introduces CL to engineering design by benchmarking several CL methods on representative regression tasks. We apply these strategies to five engineering datasets and construct nine new engineering CL benchmarks to evaluate their ability to address forgetting and improve generalization. Preliminary results show that applying existing CL methods to these tasks improves performance over naive baselines. In particular, the Replay strategy achieved performance comparable to retraining in several benchmarks while reducing training time by nearly half, demonstrating its potential for real-world engineering workflows.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising hybrid quantum-classical methods designed to leverage the computational advantages of quantum computing while mitigating the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Although VQAs have been demonstrated as proofs of concept, their practical utility in solving real-world problems -- and whether quantum-inspired classical algorithms can match their performance -- remains an open question. We present a novel application of the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) and its classical neural quantum states-based counterpart, the variational neural linear solver (VNLS), as key components within a minimum map Newton solver for a complementarity-based rigid body contact model. We demonstrate using the VNLS that our solver accurately simulates the dynamics of rigid spherical bodies during collision events. These results suggest that quantum and quantum-inspired linear algebra algorithms can serve as viable alternatives to standard linear algebra solvers for modeling certain physical systems.

Summary:<br />
Offline model-based optimization (MBO) involves maximizing a black-box objective function using a dataset of designs and scores. Traditional methods use surrogate models but are prone to errors when predicting scores for new designs. To address this, DEMO introduces a diffusion prior to calibrate overly optimized designs. It generates pseudo design candidates using gradient ascent, then refines them through an editing process involving noise and denoising with the diffusion prior. Empirical evaluations across seven tasks show that DEMO, with proper tuning, achieves competitive scores compared to previous literature. <div>

Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to maximize a black-box objective function using only an offline dataset of designs and scores. These tasks span various domains, such as robotics, material design, and protein and molecular engineering. A common approach involves training a surrogate model using existing designs and their corresponding scores, and then generating new designs through gradient-based updates with respect to the surrogate model. This method suffers from the out-of-distribution issue, where the surrogate model may erroneously predict high scores for unseen designs. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method, Design Editing for Offline Model-based Optimization (DEMO), which leverages a diffusion prior to calibrate overly optimized designs. DEMO first generates pseudo design candidates by performing gradient ascent with respect to a surrogate model. While these pseudo design candidates contain information beyond the offline dataset, they might be invalid or have erroneously high predicted scores. Therefore, to address this challenge while utilizing the information provided by pseudo design candidates, we propose an editing process to refine these pseudo design candidates. We introduce noise to the pseudo design candidates and subsequently denoise them with a diffusion prior trained on the offline dataset, ensuring they align with the distribution of valid designs. Empirical evaluations on seven offline MBO tasks show that, with properly tuned hyperparameters, DEMOs score is competitive with the best previously reported scores in the literature.

The paper explores the computation of market equilibrium in scenarios with a large-scale buyer population using a deep learning-based method called MarketFCNet. The approach introduces a contextual market model where buyers and goods are represented by their contexts.

An efficient method is proposed to estimate the loss function for training the network, enabling optimization through gradient descent. The Nash Gap metric is introduced to measure the deviation of the allocation and prices from the market equilibrium. Experimental results show that MarketFCNet outperforms existing methods in terms of performance and running times as the market scale increases, showcasing the potential of deep learning in approximating large-scale contextual market equilibrium. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Market equilibrium is one of the most fundamental solution concepts in economics and social optimization analysis. Existing works on market equilibrium computation primarily focus on settings with relatively few buyers. Motivated by this, our paper investigates the computation of market equilibrium in scenarios with a large-scale buyer population, where buyers and goods are represented by their contexts. Building on this realistic and generalized contextual market model, we introduce MarketFCNet, a deep learning-based method for approximating market equilibrium. We start by parameterizing the allocation of each good to each buyer using a neural network, which depends solely on the context of the buyer and the good. Next, we propose an efficient method to unbiasedly estimate the loss function of the training algorithm, enabling us to optimize the network parameters through gradient. To evaluate the approximated solution, we propose a metric called Nash Gap, which quantifies the deviation of the given allocation and price pair from the market equilibrium. Experimental results indicate that MarketFCNet delivers competitive performance and significantly lower running times compared to existing methods as the market scale expands, demonstrating the potential of deep learning-based methods to accelerate the approximation of large-scale contextual market equilibrium.

However, a lack of open-source training data for realistic road cars using high-fidelity CFD methods is impeding progress. To overcome this hurdle, a high-fidelity open-source dataset for automotive aerodynamics has been created. The dataset comprises 500 variants of the DrivAer notchback vehicle, generated through parametric morphing. Mesh generation and scale-resolving CFD were conducted using state-of-the-art automated workflows. The dataset, published under the CC-BY-SA license, includes geometries and detailed aerodynamic information. This initiative marks the first large public-domain dataset for complex automotive configurations derived from high-fidelity CFD simulations. <div>

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has the potential to revolutionise the field of automotive aerodynamics, enabling split-second flow predictions early in the design process. However, the lack of open-source training data for realistic road cars, using high-fidelity CFD methods, represents a barrier to their development. To address this, a high-fidelity open-source (CC-BY-SA) public dataset for automotive aerodynamics has been generated, based on 500 parametrically morphed variants of the widely-used DrivAer notchback generic vehicle. Mesh generation and scale-resolving CFD was executed using consistent and validated automatic workflows representative of the industrial state-of-the-art. Geometries and rich aerodynamic data are published in open-source formats. To our knowledge, this is the first large, public-domain dataset for complex automotive configurations generated using high-fidelity CFD.

Summary: 
Dynamic hedging involves offsetting financial risk through periodic transactions. This study compares the performance of eight DRL algorithms in dynamic hedging scenarios. The algorithms include Monte Carlo Policy Gradient (MCPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), various Deep Q-Learning (DQL) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) variants. The experiments use a GJR-GARCH(1,1) model to simulate the dataset and evaluate against the Black-Scholes delta hedge baseline. Results show that MCPG and PPO perform best in terms of the root semi-quadratic penalty. MCPG outperforms the baseline within the allotted computational budget due to sparse rewards in the environment. This comparison provides insights into the effectiveness of different DRL algorithms in dynamic hedging strategies, with potential implications for financial risk management.

Abstract: Dynamic hedging is a financial strategy that consists in periodically transacting one or multiple financial assets to offset the risk associated with a correlated liability. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have been used to find optimal solutions to dynamic hedging problems by framing them as sequential decision-making problems. However, most previous work assesses the performance of only one or two DRL algorithms, making an objective comparison across algorithms difficult. In this paper, we compare the performance of eight DRL algorithms in the context of dynamic hedging; Monte Carlo Policy Gradient (MCPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), along with four variants of Deep Q-Learning (DQL) and two variants of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Two of these variants represent a novel application to the task of dynamic hedging. In our experiments, we use the Black-Scholes delta hedge as a baseline and simulate the dataset using a GJR-GARCH(1,1) model. Results show that MCPG, followed by PPO, obtain the best performance in terms of the root semi-quadratic penalty. Moreover, MCPG is the only algorithm to outperform the Black-Scholes delta hedge baseline with the allotted computational budget, possibly due to the sparsity of rewards in our environment.

<div> Keywords: self-supervised learning, deep learning, morphological profiling, high-throughput microscopy screens, chemical compound structure

Summary:
Recent advances in self-supervised deep learning have led to improved quantification of cellular morphological changes in high-throughput microscopy screens. The new framework, MICON (Molecular-Image Contrastive Learning), incorporates chemical compound information during pre-training to enhance learned image representations. MICON surpasses traditional feature extraction methods like CellProfiler and existing deep learning approaches, especially in identifying consistent effects of drugs across independent replicates and data centers. By modeling chemical compounds as treatments inducing counterfactual transformations of cell phenotypes, MICON outperforms methods that directly align images and compounds. This highlights the importance of considering the multimodal nature of microscopy screening data in representation learning for morphological profiling. MICON's success suggests a promising direction for future research in this field.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised deep learning have improved our ability to quantify cellular morphological changes in high-throughput microscopy screens, a process known as morphological profiling. However, most current methods only learn from images, despite many screens being inherently multimodal, as they involve both a chemical or genetic perturbation as well as an image-based readout. We hypothesized that incorporating chemical compound structure during self-supervised pre-training could improve learned representations of images in high-throughput microscopy screens. We introduce a representation learning framework, MICON (Molecular-Image Contrastive Learning), that models chemical compounds as treatments that induce counterfactual transformations of cell phenotypes. MICON significantly outperforms classical hand-crafted features such as CellProfiler and existing deep-learning-based representation learning methods in challenging evaluation settings where models must identify reproducible effects of drugs across independent replicates and data-generating centers. We demonstrate that incorporating chemical compound information into the learning process provides consistent improvements in our evaluation setting and that modeling compounds specifically as treatments in a causal framework outperforms approaches that directly align images and compounds in a single representation space. Our findings point to a new direction for representation learning in morphological profiling, suggesting that methods should explicitly account for the multimodal nature of microscopy screening data.

<title>A viscoplasticity model with an invariant-based non-Newtonian flow rule for unidirectional thermoplastic composites</title>

Abstract: A three-dimensional mesoscopic viscoplasticity model for simulating rate-dependent plasticity and creep in unidirectional thermoplastic composites is presented. The constitutive model is a transversely isotropic extension of an isotropic finite strain viscoplasticity model for neat polymers. Rate-dependent plasticity and creep are described by a non-Newtonian flow rule where the viscosity of the material depends on an equivalent stress measure through an Eyring-type relation. In the present formulation, transverse isotropy is incorporated by defining the equivalent stress measure and flow rule as functions of transversely isotropic stress invariants. In addition, the Eyring-type viscosity function is extended with anisotropic pressure dependence. As a result of the formulation, plastic flow in fiber direction is effectively excluded and pressure dependence of the polymer matrix is accounted for. The re-orientation of the transversely isotropic plane during plastic deformations is incorporated in the constitutive equations, allowing for an accurate large deformation response. The formulation is fully implicit and a consistent linearization of the algorithmic constitutive equations is performed to derive the consistent tangent modulus. The performance of the mesoscopic constitutive model is assessed through a comparison with a micromechanical model for carbon/PEEK, with the original isotropic viscoplastic version for the polymer matrix and with hyperelastic fibers. The micromodel is first used to determine the material parameters of the mesoscale model with a few stress-strain curves. It is demonstrated that the mesoscale model gives a similar response to the micromodel under various loading conditions. Finally, the mesoscale model is validated against off-axis experiments on unidirectional thermoplastic composite plies.

Abstract: Deep Material Network (DMN) has emerged as a powerful framework for multiscale material modeling, enabling efficient and accurate predictions of material behavior across different length scales. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, the trainable parameters in DMN have direct physical interpretations, capturing the geometric characteristics of the microstructure rather than serving as purely statistical fitting parameters. Its hierarchical tree structure effectively encodes microstructural interactions and deformation mechanisms, allowing DMN to achieve a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This physics-informed architecture significantly reduces computational costs compared to direct numerical simulations while preserving essential microstructural physics. Furthermore, DMN can be trained solely on a linear elastic dataset while effectively extrapolating nonlinear responses during online prediction, making it a highly efficient and scalable approach for multiscale material modeling. This article provides a comprehensive review of DMN, detailing its motivation, underlying methodology, and recent advancements. We discuss key modeling aspects, including its hierarchical structure, training process, and the role of physics-based constraints in enhancing predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we highlight its applications in component-scale multiscale analysis and inverse parameter identification, demonstrating its capability to bridge microscale material behavior with macroscale engineering predictions. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions in improving DMN's generalization capabilities and its potential extensions for broader applications in multiscale modeling.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency users increasingly rely on obfuscation techniques such as mixers, swappers, and decentralised or no-KYC exchanges to protect their anonymity. However, at the same time, these services are exploited by criminals to conceal and launder illicit funds. Among obfuscation services, mixers remain one of the most challenging entities to tackle. This is because their owners are often unwilling to cooperate with Law Enforcement Agencies, and technically, they operate as 'black boxes'. To better understand their functionalities, this paper proposes an approach to analyse the operations of mixers by examining their address-transaction graphs and identifying topological similarities to uncover common patterns that can define the mixer's modus operandi. The approach utilises community detection algorithms to extract dense topological structures and clustering algorithms to group similar communities. The analysis is further enriched by incorporating data from external sources related to known Exchanges, in order to understand their role in mixer operations. The approach is applied to dissect the Blender.io mixer activities within the Bitcoin blockchain, revealing: i) consistent structural patterns across address-transaction graphs; ii) that Exchanges play a key role, following a well-established pattern, which raises several concerns about their AML/KYC policies. This paper represents an initial step toward dissecting and understanding the complex nature of mixer operations in cryptocurrency networks and extracting their modus operandi.

Abstract: Phosphorylation site prediction based on kinase-substrate interaction plays a vital role in understanding cellular signaling pathways and disease mechanisms. Computational methods for this task can be categorized into kinase-family-focused and individual kinase-targeted approaches. Individual kinase-targeted methods have gained prominence for their ability to explore a broader protein space and provide more precise target information for kinase inhibitors. However, most existing individual kinase-based approaches focus solely on sequence inputs, neglecting crucial structural information. To address this limitation, we introduce SAGEPhos (Structure-aware kinAse-substrate bio-coupled and bio-auGmented nEtwork for Phosphorylation site prediction), a novel framework that modifies the semantic space of main protein inputs using auxiliary inputs at two distinct modality levels. At the inter-modality level, SAGEPhos introduces a Bio-Coupled Modal Fusion method, distilling essential kinase sequence information to refine task-oriented local substrate feature space, creating a shared semantic space that captures crucial kinase-substrate interaction patterns. Within the substrate's intra-modality domain, it focuses on Bio-Augmented Fusion, emphasizing 2D local sequence information while selectively incorporating 3D spatial information from predicted structures to complement the sequence space. Moreover, to address the lack of structural information in current datasets, we contribute a new, refined phosphorylation site prediction dataset, which incorporates crucial structural elements and will serve as a new benchmark for the field. Experimental results demonstrate that SAGEPhos significantly outperforms baseline methods. We release the SAGEPhos models and code at https://github.com/ZhangJJ26/SAGEPhos.

<title>QPET: A Versatile and Portable Quantity-of-Interest-Preservation Framework for Error-Bounded Lossy Compression</title>

Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression has been widely adopted in many scientific domains because it can address the challenges in storing, transferring, and analyzing unprecedented amounts of scientific data. Although error-bounded lossy compression offers general data distortion control by enforcing strict error bounds on raw data, it may fail to meet the quality requirements on the results of downstream analysis, a.k.a. Quantities of Interest (QoIs), derived from raw data. This may lead to uncertainties and even misinterpretations in scientific discoveries, significantly limiting the use of lossy compression in practice. In this paper, we propose QPET, a novel, versatile, and portable framework for QoI-preserving error-bounded lossy compression, which overcomes the challenges of modeling diverse QoIs by leveraging numerical strategies. QPET features (1) high portability to multiple existing lossy compressors, (2) versatile preservation to most differentiable univariate and multivariate QoIs, and (3) significant compression improvements in QoI-preservation tasks. Experiments with six real-world datasets demonstrate that integrating QPET into state-of-the-art error-bounded lossy compressors can gain 2x to 10x compression speedups of existing QoI-preserving error-bounded lossy compression solutions, up to 1000% compression ratio improvements to general-purpose compressors, and up to 133% compression ratio improvements to existing QoI-integrated scientific compressors.

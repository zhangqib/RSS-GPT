<div> Keywords: reflection coefficient, antenna, planar layered medium, generalized scattering matrix, numerical algorithm

Summary: 
The article presents a new numerical algorithm for evaluating the reflection coefficient of an antenna in the presence of a planar layered medium. This algorithm utilizes the antenna's generalized scattering matrix (GSM) to model the interaction between the antenna and the medium through spherical-to-planar vector wave transformations. By avoiding approximations that could compromise accuracy, the algorithm reduces algebraic complexity and significantly speeds up antenna performance evaluation. While a one-time preprocessing cost is required to obtain the antenna's GSM in free space, the numerical evaluation speed of this method surpasses that of commercial software FEKO by several orders of magnitude, maintaining high accuracy. This advancement in computational efficiency offers a promising approach for accurately evaluating antenna performance in complex scenarios involving layered media.

Abstract: The numerical algorithm for evaluating the reflection coefficient of an antenna in the presence of the planar layered medium is reformulated using the antenna's generalized scattering matrix (GSM). The interaction between the antenna and the layered medium is modeled through spherical-to-planar vector wave transformations, ensuring no approximations that could compromise computational accuracy. This theoretical framework significantly reduces algebraic complexity, resulting in a marked increase in the speed of antenna performance evaluation. Excluding the one-time preprocessing cost of obtaining the antenna's GSM in free space, the numerical evaluation speed of this method exceeds that of the commercial software FEKO by several orders of magnitude, while maintaining nearly identical accuracy.

Abstract: Engineering problems that apply machine learning often involve computationally intensive methods but rely on limited datasets. As engineering data evolves with new designs and constraints, models must incorporate new knowledge over time. However, high computational costs make retraining models from scratch infeasible. Continual learning (CL) offers a promising solution by enabling models to learn from sequential data while mitigating catastrophic forgetting, where a model forgets previously learned mappings. This work introduces CL to engineering design by benchmarking several CL methods on representative regression tasks. We apply these strategies to five engineering datasets and construct nine new engineering CL benchmarks to evaluate their ability to address forgetting and improve generalization. Preliminary results show that applying existing CL methods to these tasks improves performance over naive baselines. In particular, the Replay strategy achieved performance comparable to retraining in several benchmarks while reducing training time by nearly half, demonstrating its potential for real-world engineering workflows. The code and datasets used in this work will be available at: https://github.com/kmsamuel/cl-for-engineering-release.

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising hybrid quantum-classical methods designed to leverage the computational advantages of quantum computing while mitigating the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Although VQAs have been demonstrated as proofs of concept, their practical utility in solving real-world problems -- and whether quantum-inspired classical algorithms can match their performance -- remains an open question. We present a novel application of the variational quantum linear solver (VQLS) and its classical neural quantum states-based counterpart, the variational neural linear solver (VNLS), as key components within a minimum map Newton solver for a complementarity-based rigid body contact model. We demonstrate using the VNLS that our solver accurately simulates the dynamics of rigid spherical bodies during collision events. These results suggest that quantum and quantum-inspired linear algebra algorithms can serve as viable alternatives to standard linear algebra solvers for modeling certain physical systems.

Summary:<br />
Offline model-based optimization (MBO) involves maximizing a black-box objective function using a dataset of designs and scores. Traditional methods use surrogate models but are prone to errors when predicting scores for new designs. To address this, DEMO introduces a diffusion prior to calibrate overly optimized designs. It generates pseudo design candidates using gradient ascent, then refines them through an editing process involving noise and denoising with the diffusion prior. Empirical evaluations across seven tasks show that DEMO, with proper tuning, achieves competitive scores compared to previous literature. <div>

Abstract: Offline model-based optimization (MBO) aims to maximize a black-box objective function using only an offline dataset of designs and scores. These tasks span various domains, such as robotics, material design, and protein and molecular engineering. A common approach involves training a surrogate model using existing designs and their corresponding scores, and then generating new designs through gradient-based updates with respect to the surrogate model. This method suffers from the out-of-distribution issue, where the surrogate model may erroneously predict high scores for unseen designs. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel method, Design Editing for Offline Model-based Optimization (DEMO), which leverages a diffusion prior to calibrate overly optimized designs. DEMO first generates pseudo design candidates by performing gradient ascent with respect to a surrogate model. While these pseudo design candidates contain information beyond the offline dataset, they might be invalid or have erroneously high predicted scores. Therefore, to address this challenge while utilizing the information provided by pseudo design candidates, we propose an editing process to refine these pseudo design candidates. We introduce noise to the pseudo design candidates and subsequently denoise them with a diffusion prior trained on the offline dataset, ensuring they align with the distribution of valid designs. Empirical evaluations on seven offline MBO tasks show that, with properly tuned hyperparameters, DEMOs score is competitive with the best previously reported scores in the literature.

<br />
Summary: 
The paper explores the computation of market equilibrium in scenarios with a large-scale buyer population using a deep learning-based method called MarketFCNet. The approach introduces a contextual market model where buyers and goods are represented by their contexts. MarketFCNet uses a neural network to parameterize the allocation of goods to buyers based on their contexts. An efficient method is proposed to estimate the loss function for training the network, enabling optimization through gradient descent. The Nash Gap metric is introduced to measure the deviation of the allocation and prices from the market equilibrium. Experimental results show that MarketFCNet outperforms existing methods in terms of performance and running times as the market scale increases, showcasing the potential of deep learning in approximating large-scale contextual market equilibrium. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Market equilibrium is one of the most fundamental solution concepts in economics and social optimization analysis. Existing works on market equilibrium computation primarily focus on settings with relatively few buyers. Motivated by this, our paper investigates the computation of market equilibrium in scenarios with a large-scale buyer population, where buyers and goods are represented by their contexts. Building on this realistic and generalized contextual market model, we introduce MarketFCNet, a deep learning-based method for approximating market equilibrium. We start by parameterizing the allocation of each good to each buyer using a neural network, which depends solely on the context of the buyer and the good. Next, we propose an efficient method to unbiasedly estimate the loss function of the training algorithm, enabling us to optimize the network parameters through gradient. To evaluate the approximated solution, we propose a metric called Nash Gap, which quantifies the deviation of the given allocation and price pair from the market equilibrium. Experimental results indicate that MarketFCNet delivers competitive performance and significantly lower running times compared to existing methods as the market scale expands, demonstrating the potential of deep learning-based methods to accelerate the approximation of large-scale contextual market equilibrium.

However, a lack of open-source training data for realistic road cars using high-fidelity CFD methods is impeding progress. To overcome this hurdle, a high-fidelity open-source dataset for automotive aerodynamics has been created. The dataset comprises 500 variants of the DrivAer notchback vehicle, generated through parametric morphing. Mesh generation and scale-resolving CFD were conducted using state-of-the-art automated workflows. The dataset, published under the CC-BY-SA license, includes geometries and detailed aerodynamic information. This initiative marks the first large public-domain dataset for complex automotive configurations derived from high-fidelity CFD simulations. <div>

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) has the potential to revolutionise the field of automotive aerodynamics, enabling split-second flow predictions early in the design process. However, the lack of open-source training data for realistic road cars, using high-fidelity CFD methods, represents a barrier to their development. To address this, a high-fidelity open-source (CC-BY-SA) public dataset for automotive aerodynamics has been generated, based on 500 parametrically morphed variants of the widely-used DrivAer notchback generic vehicle. Mesh generation and scale-resolving CFD was executed using consistent and validated automatic workflows representative of the industrial state-of-the-art. Geometries and rich aerodynamic data are published in open-source formats. To our knowledge, this is the first large, public-domain dataset for complex automotive configurations generated using high-fidelity CFD.

Summary: 
Dynamic hedging involves offsetting financial risk through periodic transactions. This study compares the performance of eight DRL algorithms in dynamic hedging scenarios. The algorithms include Monte Carlo Policy Gradient (MCPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), various Deep Q-Learning (DQL) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) variants. The experiments use a GJR-GARCH(1,1) model to simulate the dataset and evaluate against the Black-Scholes delta hedge baseline. Results show that MCPG and PPO perform best in terms of the root semi-quadratic penalty. MCPG outperforms the baseline within the allotted computational budget due to sparse rewards in the environment. This comparison provides insights into the effectiveness of different DRL algorithms in dynamic hedging strategies, with potential implications for financial risk management.

Abstract: Dynamic hedging is a financial strategy that consists in periodically transacting one or multiple financial assets to offset the risk associated with a correlated liability. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have been used to find optimal solutions to dynamic hedging problems by framing them as sequential decision-making problems. However, most previous work assesses the performance of only one or two DRL algorithms, making an objective comparison across algorithms difficult. In this paper, we compare the performance of eight DRL algorithms in the context of dynamic hedging; Monte Carlo Policy Gradient (MCPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), along with four variants of Deep Q-Learning (DQL) and two variants of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Two of these variants represent a novel application to the task of dynamic hedging. In our experiments, we use the Black-Scholes delta hedge as a baseline and simulate the dataset using a GJR-GARCH(1,1) model. Results show that MCPG, followed by PPO, obtain the best performance in terms of the root semi-quadratic penalty. Moreover, MCPG is the only algorithm to outperform the Black-Scholes delta hedge baseline with the allotted computational budget, possibly due to the sparsity of rewards in our environment.

Summary:
Recent advances in self-supervised deep learning have led to improved quantification of cellular morphological changes in high-throughput microscopy screens. The new framework, MICON (Molecular-Image Contrastive Learning), incorporates chemical compound information during pre-training to enhance learned image representations. MICON surpasses traditional feature extraction methods like CellProfiler and existing deep learning approaches, especially in identifying consistent effects of drugs across independent replicates and data centers. By modeling chemical compounds as treatments inducing counterfactual transformations of cell phenotypes, MICON outperforms methods that directly align images and compounds. This highlights the importance of considering the multimodal nature of microscopy screening data in representation learning for morphological profiling. MICON's success suggests a promising direction for future research in this field.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised deep learning have improved our ability to quantify cellular morphological changes in high-throughput microscopy screens, a process known as morphological profiling. However, most current methods only learn from images, despite many screens being inherently multimodal, as they involve both a chemical or genetic perturbation as well as an image-based readout. We hypothesized that incorporating chemical compound structure during self-supervised pre-training could improve learned representations of images in high-throughput microscopy screens. We introduce a representation learning framework, MICON (Molecular-Image Contrastive Learning), that models chemical compounds as treatments that induce counterfactual transformations of cell phenotypes. MICON significantly outperforms classical hand-crafted features such as CellProfiler and existing deep-learning-based representation learning methods in challenging evaluation settings where models must identify reproducible effects of drugs across independent replicates and data-generating centers. We demonstrate that incorporating chemical compound information into the learning process provides consistent improvements in our evaluation setting and that modeling compounds specifically as treatments in a causal framework outperforms approaches that directly align images and compounds in a single representation space. Our findings point to a new direction for representation learning in morphological profiling, suggesting that methods should explicitly account for the multimodal nature of microscopy screening data.

<title>A viscoplasticity model with an invariant-based non-Newtonian flow rule for unidirectional thermoplastic composites</title>

Abstract: A three-dimensional mesoscopic viscoplasticity model for simulating rate-dependent plasticity and creep in unidirectional thermoplastic composites is presented. The constitutive model is a transversely isotropic extension of an isotropic finite strain viscoplasticity model for neat polymers. Rate-dependent plasticity and creep are described by a non-Newtonian flow rule where the viscosity of the material depends on an equivalent stress measure through an Eyring-type relation. In the present formulation, transverse isotropy is incorporated by defining the equivalent stress measure and flow rule as functions of transversely isotropic stress invariants. In addition, the Eyring-type viscosity function is extended with anisotropic pressure dependence. As a result of the formulation, plastic flow in fiber direction is effectively excluded and pressure dependence of the polymer matrix is accounted for. The re-orientation of the transversely isotropic plane during plastic deformations is incorporated in the constitutive equations, allowing for an accurate large deformation response. The formulation is fully implicit and a consistent linearization of the algorithmic constitutive equations is performed to derive the consistent tangent modulus. The performance of the mesoscopic constitutive model is assessed through a comparison with a micromechanical model for carbon/PEEK, with the original isotropic viscoplastic version for the polymer matrix and with hyperelastic fibers. The micromodel is first used to determine the material parameters of the mesoscale model with a few stress-strain curves. It is demonstrated that the mesoscale model gives a similar response to the micromodel under various loading conditions. Finally, the mesoscale model is validated against off-axis experiments on unidirectional thermoplastic composite plies.

Abstract: Deep Material Network (DMN) has emerged as a powerful framework for multiscale material modeling, enabling efficient and accurate predictions of material behavior across different length scales. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, the trainable parameters in DMN have direct physical interpretations, capturing the geometric characteristics of the microstructure rather than serving as purely statistical fitting parameters. Its hierarchical tree structure effectively encodes microstructural interactions and deformation mechanisms, allowing DMN to achieve a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This physics-informed architecture significantly reduces computational costs compared to direct numerical simulations while preserving essential microstructural physics. Furthermore, DMN can be trained solely on a linear elastic dataset while effectively extrapolating nonlinear responses during online prediction, making it a highly efficient and scalable approach for multiscale material modeling. This article provides a comprehensive review of DMN, detailing its motivation, underlying methodology, and recent advancements. We discuss key modeling aspects, including its hierarchical structure, training process, and the role of physics-based constraints in enhancing predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we highlight its applications in component-scale multiscale analysis and inverse parameter identification, demonstrating its capability to bridge microscale material behavior with macroscale engineering predictions. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions in improving DMN's generalization capabilities and its potential extensions for broader applications in multiscale modeling.

Abstract: Cryptocurrency users increasingly rely on obfuscation techniques such as mixers, swappers, and decentralised or no-KYC exchanges to protect their anonymity. However, at the same time, these services are exploited by criminals to conceal and launder illicit funds. Among obfuscation services, mixers remain one of the most challenging entities to tackle. This is because their owners are often unwilling to cooperate with Law Enforcement Agencies, and technically, they operate as 'black boxes'. To better understand their functionalities, this paper proposes an approach to analyse the operations of mixers by examining their address-transaction graphs and identifying topological similarities to uncover common patterns that can define the mixer's modus operandi. The approach utilises community detection algorithms to extract dense topological structures and clustering algorithms to group similar communities. The analysis is further enriched by incorporating data from external sources related to known Exchanges, in order to understand their role in mixer operations. The approach is applied to dissect the Blender.io mixer activities within the Bitcoin blockchain, revealing: i) consistent structural patterns across address-transaction graphs; ii) that Exchanges play a key role, following a well-established pattern, which raises several concerns about their AML/KYC policies. This paper represents an initial step toward dissecting and understanding the complex nature of mixer operations in cryptocurrency networks and extracting their modus operandi.

Abstract: Phosphorylation site prediction based on kinase-substrate interaction plays a vital role in understanding cellular signaling pathways and disease mechanisms. Computational methods for this task can be categorized into kinase-family-focused and individual kinase-targeted approaches. Individual kinase-targeted methods have gained prominence for their ability to explore a broader protein space and provide more precise target information for kinase inhibitors. However, most existing individual kinase-based approaches focus solely on sequence inputs, neglecting crucial structural information. To address this limitation, we introduce SAGEPhos (Structure-aware kinAse-substrate bio-coupled and bio-auGmented nEtwork for Phosphorylation site prediction), a novel framework that modifies the semantic space of main protein inputs using auxiliary inputs at two distinct modality levels. At the inter-modality level, SAGEPhos introduces a Bio-Coupled Modal Fusion method, distilling essential kinase sequence information to refine task-oriented local substrate feature space, creating a shared semantic space that captures crucial kinase-substrate interaction patterns. Within the substrate's intra-modality domain, it focuses on Bio-Augmented Fusion, emphasizing 2D local sequence information while selectively incorporating 3D spatial information from predicted structures to complement the sequence space. Moreover, to address the lack of structural information in current datasets, we contribute a new, refined phosphorylation site prediction dataset, which incorporates crucial structural elements and will serve as a new benchmark for the field. Experimental results demonstrate that SAGEPhos significantly outperforms baseline methods. We release the SAGEPhos models and code at https://github.com/ZhangJJ26/SAGEPhos.

Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression has been widely adopted in many scientific domains because it can address the challenges in storing, transferring, and analyzing unprecedented amounts of scientific data. Although error-bounded lossy compression offers general data distortion control by enforcing strict error bounds on raw data, it may fail to meet the quality requirements on the results of downstream analysis, a.k.a. Quantities of Interest (QoIs), derived from raw data. This may lead to uncertainties and even misinterpretations in scientific discoveries, significantly limiting the use of lossy compression in practice. In this paper, we propose QPET, a novel, versatile, and portable framework for QoI-preserving error-bounded lossy compression, which overcomes the challenges of modeling diverse QoIs by leveraging numerical strategies. QPET features (1) high portability to multiple existing lossy compressors, (2) versatile preservation to most differentiable univariate and multivariate QoIs, and (3) significant compression improvements in QoI-preservation tasks. Experiments with six real-world datasets demonstrate that integrating QPET into state-of-the-art error-bounded lossy compressors can gain 2x to 10x compression speedups of existing QoI-preserving error-bounded lossy compression solutions, up to 1000% compression ratio improvements to general-purpose compressors, and up to 133% compression ratio improvements to existing QoI-integrated scientific compressors.

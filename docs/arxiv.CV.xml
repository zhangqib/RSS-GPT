Summary:
Colorectal cancer is a significant global health issue, with GI polyps serving as critical precursors. Automated segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy is essential for early detection, but manual delineation is labor-intensive. The PolypSeg-GradCAM framework integrates the U-Net architecture with Grad-CAM for transparent polyp segmentation. Trained on the Kvasir-SEG dataset, the model achieved a high mean Intersection over Union (IoU) on the test set and demonstrated reliable segmentation performance. The model's interpretability was enhanced through Grad-CAM visualizations, showcasing that predictions were guided by clinically relevant regions. The PolypSeg-GradCAM approach combines accurate segmentation with transparency, aiming to improve early colorectal cancer prevention through trustworthy AI-assisted colonoscopy. <br><br> <div>

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, with gastrointestinal (GI) polyps serving as critical precursors according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Early and accurate segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy is essential for reducing CRC progression, yet manual delineation is labor-intensive and prone to observer variability. Deep learning methods have demonstrated strong potential for automated polyp analysis, but their limited interpretability remains a barrier to clinical adoption. In this study, we present PolypSeg-GradCAM, an explainable deep learning framework that integrates the U-Net architecture with Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for transparent polyp segmentation. The model was trained and evaluated on the Kvasir-SEG dataset of 1000 annotated endoscopic images. Experimental results demonstrate robust segmentation performance, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.9257 on the test set and consistently high Dice coefficients (F-score > 0.96) on training and validation sets. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirmed that predictions were guided by clinically relevant regions, enhancing transparency and trust in the model's decisions. By coupling high segmentation accuracy with interpretability, PolypSeg-GradCAM represents a step toward reliable, trustworthy AI-assisted colonoscopy and improved early colorectal cancer prevention.

<div> Keywords: regularization, deep learning, representation learning, inverse mapping, gradient flow 

Summary:
Regularization plays a crucial role in deep learning to prevent overfitting and enhance generalization. Traditional techniques often rely on heuristics and may not be effective in diverse settings. In this study, Self Identity Mapping (SIM) is introduced as a data-intrinsic regularization framework that reconstructs input from transformed output to reduce information loss during forward propagation and facilitate smoother gradient flow. The instantiation of SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ incorporates patch-level feature sampling and projection-based methods to lower complexity. $\rho\text{SIM}$ is model-agnostic and task-agnostic, making it versatile and easily integrable into different network architectures. Experimental evaluations on image classification, few-shot learning, domain generalization, semantic segmentation, image translation, audio classification, and time series anomaly detection show consistent improvements over baseline methods. Additionally, $\rho\text{SIM}$ is shown to preserve semantic information effectively and enhance performance across various tasks, while complementing existing regularization methods. The source code is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/XiudingCai/SIM-pytorch.

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deep learning to enhance generalization and mitigate overfitting. However, conventional techniques often rely on heuristics, making them less reliable or effective across diverse settings. We propose Self Identity Mapping (SIM), a simple yet effective, data-intrinsic regularization framework that leverages an inverse mapping mechanism to enhance representation learning. By reconstructing the input from its transformed output, SIM reduces information loss during forward propagation and facilitates smoother gradient flow. To address computational inefficiencies, We instantiate SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ by incorporating patch-level feature sampling and projection-based method to reconstruct latent features, effectively lowering complexity. As a model-agnostic, task-agnostic regularizer, SIM can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module, making it applicable to different network architectures and tasks.
  We extensively evaluate $\rho\text{SIM}$ across three tasks: image classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization. Experimental results show consistent improvements over baseline methods, highlighting $\rho\text{SIM}$'s ability to enhance representation learning across various tasks. We also demonstrate that $\rho\text{SIM}$ is orthogonal to existing regularization methods, boosting their effectiveness. Moreover, our results confirm that $\rho\text{SIM}$ effectively preserves semantic information and enhances performance in dense-to-dense tasks, such as semantic segmentation and image translation, as well as in non-visual domains including audio classification and time series anomaly detection. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/XiudingCai/SIM-pytorch.

Summary: <br>
The study focuses on gradient inversion in the SAG regime, introducing the MAGIA framework for label inference-free image reconstruction. MAGIA incorporates a momentum-based adaptive correction approach that utilizes random data subsets to sense latent image signals. Two key innovations - a combinatorial rescaling and momentum-based mixing of whole batch and subset losses - ensure reconstruction robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate MAGIA's superior performance compared to existing methods, achieving high fidelity multi-image reconstruction in large batch scenarios. This success is achieved with a comparable computational footprint to standard solvers and without the need for auxiliary information. <div>

Abstract: Arabic document OCR remains a challenging task due to the language's cursive script, diverse fonts, diacritics, and right-to-left orientation. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced document understanding for high-resource languages, their performance on Arabic remains limited. In this work, we introduce Baseer, a vision-language model fine- tuned specifically for Arabic document OCR. Leveraging a large-scale dataset combining synthetic and real-world documents, Baseer is trained using a decoder-only fine-tuning strategy to adapt a pre-trained MLLM while preserving general visual features. We also present Misraj-DocOCR, a high-quality, expert-verified benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of Arabic OCR systems. Our experiments show that Baseer significantly outperforms existing open-source and commercial solutions, achieving a WER of 0.25 and establishing a new state-of-the-art in the domain of Arabic document OCR. Our results highlight the benefits of domain-specific adaptation of general-purpose MLLMs and establish a strong baseline for high-accuracy OCR on morphologically rich languages like Arabic.

Summary: 
Ground displacement monitoring is essential for urban infrastructure stability and geological hazard mitigation. Forecasting deformation from sparse InSAR data poses a challenge addressed by a novel deep learning framework. This framework transforms sparse measurements into a dense spatio-temporal tensor, enabling the application of advanced computer vision architectures such as the CNN-LSTM model. Benchmarking against machine learning baselines using Sentinel-1 data from eastern Ireland, the CNN-LSTM model outperforms in accuracy and spatial coherence. Interpretability analysis reveals the model's ability to capture complex deformation dynamics compared to simplistic persistence patterns of baseline models. This study validates the effectiveness of spatio-temporal deep learning for high-resolution deformation forecasting.

Abstract: Monitoring ground displacement is crucial for urban infrastructure stability and mitigating geological hazards. However, forecasting future deformation from sparse Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series data remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework that transforms these sparse point measurements into a dense spatio-temporal tensor. This methodological shift allows, for the first time, the direct application of advanced computer vision architectures to this forecasting problem. We design and implement a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network and Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, specifically engineered to simultaneously learn spatial patterns and temporal dependencies from the generated data tensor. The model's performance is benchmarked against powerful machine learning baselines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and LASSO regression, using Sentinel-1 data from eastern Ireland. Results demonstrate that the proposed architecture provides significantly more accurate and spatially coherent forecasts, establishing a new performance benchmark for this task. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis reveals that baseline models often default to simplistic persistence patterns, highlighting the necessity of our integrated spatio-temporal approach to capture the complex dynamics of ground deformation. Our findings confirm the efficacy and potential of spatio-temporal deep learning for high-resolution deformation forecasting.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Scrapbook framework, a novel methodology designed to generate extensive datasets for probing the learned concepts of artificial intelligence (AI) models. The framework focuses on fundamental concepts such as object recognition, absolute and relative positions, and attribute identification. By generating datasets with a large number of questions about individual concepts and a wide linguistic variation, the Scrapbook framework aims to validate the model's understanding of these basic elements before tackling more complex tasks. Our experimental findings reveal that, while contemporary models demonstrate proficiency in recognizing and enumerating objects, they encounter challenges in comprehending positional information and addressing inquiries with additional constraints. Specifically, the MobileVLM-V2 model showed significant answer disagreements and plausible wrong answers, while other models exhibited a bias toward affirmative answers and struggled with questions involving geometric shapes and positional information, indicating areas for improvement in understanding and consistency. The proposed framework offers a valuable instrument for generating diverse and comprehensive datasets, which can be utilized to systematically assess and enhance the performance of AI models.

Summary:
Multimodal AI systems are increasingly integrated into creative workflows, but the impact of information loss in vision-language-vision pipelines is not well understood. This study examines the describe-then-generate bottleneck, where natural language acts as an intermediary for visual information. Through the generation of 150 image pairs and the application of metrics such as LPIPS, SSIM, and color distance, the study found that a significant majority of samples experienced perceptual and structural degradation. Specifically, 99.3% of samples showed noticeable perceptual loss, and 91.5% displayed significant structural information loss. These findings highlight the limitations of the describe-then-generate bottleneck in current multimodal systems, indicating a consistent and measurable challenge in preserving visual information through textual intermediation.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: With the increasing integration of multimodal AI systems in creative workflows, understanding information loss in vision-language-vision pipelines has become important for evaluating system limitations. However, the degradation that occurs when visual content passes through textual intermediation remains poorly quantified. In this work, we provide empirical analysis of the describe-then-generate bottleneck, where natural language serves as an intermediate representation for visual information. We generated 150 image pairs through the describe-then-generate pipeline and applied existing metrics (LPIPS, SSIM, and color distance) to measure information preservation across perceptual, structural, and chromatic dimensions. Our evaluation reveals that 99.3% of samples exhibit substantial perceptual degradation and 91.5% demonstrate significant structural information loss, providing empirical evidence that the describe-then-generate bottleneck represents a measurable and consistent limitation in contemporary multimodal systems.

Incorporating training data from neighboring SIDS significantly improves model performance, with the best models achieving high F1 scores for roof pitch and roof material classification.

Abstract: Detailed structural building information is used to estimate potential damage from hazard events like cyclones, floods, and landslides, making them critical for urban resilience planning and disaster risk reduction. However, such information is often unavailable in many small island developing states (SIDS) in climate-vulnerable regions like the Caribbean. To address this data gap, we present an AI-driven workflow to automatically infer rooftop attributes from high-resolution satellite imagery, with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as our case study. Here, we compare the utility of geospatial foundation models combined with shallow classifiers against fine-tuned deep learning models for rooftop classification. Furthermore, we assess the impact of incorporating additional training data from neighboring SIDS to improve model performance. Our best models achieve F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.83 for roof pitch and roof material classification, respectively. Combined with local capacity building, our work aims to provide SIDS with novel capabilities to harness AI and Earth Observation (EO) data to enable more efficient, evidence-based urban governance.

Summary:
The article introduces the Visual-Language-Action (VLA) model's ability to follow text instructions based on visual observations, showcasing the importance of perspective adaptivity in handling varied visual features. A lightweight module, VLA-LPAF, is proposed to enhance perspective adaptivity using only 2D data, improving task success rates on different benchmarks.

arXiv:2509.18183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models can follow text instructions according to visual observations of the surrounding environment. This ability to map multimodal inputs to actions is derived from the training of the VLA model on extensive standard demonstrations. These visual observations captured by third-personal global and in-wrist local cameras are inevitably varied in number and perspective across different environments, resulting in significant differences in the visual features. This perspective heterogeneity constrains the generality of VLA models. In light of this, we first propose the lightweight module VLA-LPAF to foster the perspective adaptivity of VLA models using only 2D data. VLA-LPAF is finetuned using images from a single view and fuses other multiview observations in the latent space, which effectively and efficiently bridge the gap caused by perspective inconsistency. We instantiate our VLA-LPAF framework with the VLA model RoboFlamingo to construct RoboFlamingo-LPAF. Experiments show that RoboFlamingo-LPAF averagely achieves around 8% task success rate improvement on CALVIN, 15% on LIBERO, and 30% on a customized simulation benchmark. We also demonstrate the developed viewadaptive characteristics of the proposed RoboFlamingo-LPAF through real-world tasks.

Summary:
Visionerves is a novel AI framework designed for recognizing the peripheral nervous system using multi-gradient DWI and morphological MRI data. It aims to improve nerve imaging in conditions such as endometriosis, where nerve involvement is common and can lead to chronic pelvic pain. The framework eliminates the need for manual selection of ROIs by encoding anatomical knowledge through fuzzy spatial relationships, improving accuracy and reducing spatial errors. In a study involving 10 women with endometriosis, Visionerves demonstrated significant enhancements over standard tractography, with improved Dice scores and reduced spatial errors. This automated approach enables detailed nerve analysis and has the potential to facilitate non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis-related neuropathy and other conditions involving nerve involvement. Visionerves represents a promising advancement in the field of peripheral nerve imaging and diagnosis.

Abstract: Endometriosis often leads to chronic pelvic pain and possible nerve involvement, yet imaging the peripheral nerves remains a challenge. We introduce Visionerves, a novel hybrid AI framework for peripheral nervous system recognition from multi-gradient DWI and morphological MRI data. Unlike conventional tractography, Visionerves encodes anatomical knowledge through fuzzy spatial relationships, removing the need for selection of manual ROIs. The pipeline comprises two phases: (A) automatic segmentation of anatomical structures using a deep learning model, and (B) tractography and nerve recognition by symbolic spatial reasoning. Applied to the lumbosacral plexus in 10 women with (confirmed or suspected) endometriosis, Visionerves demonstrated substantial improvements over standard tractography, with Dice score improvements of up to 25% and spatial errors reduced to less than 5 mm. This automatic and reproducible approach enables detailed nerve analysis and paves the way for non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis-related neuropathy, as well as other conditions with nerve involvement.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a major public health challenge, particularly in countries with heterogeneous road conditions, mixed traffic flow, and variable driving discipline, such as Pakistan. Reliable detection of unsafe driving behaviours is a prerequisite for improving road safety, enabling advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and supporting data driven decisions in insurance and fleet management. Most of existing datasets originate from the developed countries with limited representation of the behavioural diversity observed in emerging economies and the driver's face recording voilates the privacy preservation. We present V-SenseDrive, the first privacy-preserving multimodal driver behaviour dataset collected entirely within the Pakistani driving environment. V-SenseDrive combines smartphone based inertial and GPS sensor data with synchronized road facing video to record three target driving behaviours (normal, aggressive, and risky) on multiple types of roads, including urban arterials, secondary roads, and motorways. Data was gathered using a custom Android application designed to capture high frequency accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS streams alongside continuous video, with all sources precisely time aligned to enable multimodal analysis. The focus of this work is on the data acquisition process, covering participant selection, driving scenarios, environmental considerations, and sensor video synchronization techniques. The dataset is structured into raw, processed, and semantic layers, ensuring adaptability for future research in driver behaviour classification, traffic safety analysis, and ADAS development. By representing real world driving in Pakistan, V-SenseDrive fills a critical gap in the global landscape of driver behaviour datasets and lays the groundwork for context aware intelligent transportation solutions.

<div> Keywords: dehazing, deep learning, atmospheric scattering, ordinary differential equation, Markov Chain Brownian Motion 

Summary: 
HazeFlow is proposed as a novel framework for image dehazing, utilizing an ordinary differential equation formulation of the Atmospheric Scattering Model. Inspired by Rectified Flow, HazeFlow learns an optimal trajectory for mapping hazy images to clean ones, improving real-world dehazing with a single step inference method. To address the lack of paired real-world data, a non-homogeneous haze generation method using Markov Chain Brownian Motion is introduced. This method simulates realistic haze patterns, enhancing the adaptability of HazeFlow to diverse real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that HazeFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across various real-world dehazing benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Dehazing involves removing haze or fog from images to restore clarity and improve visibility by estimating atmospheric scattering effects. While deep learning methods show promise, the lack of paired real-world training data and the resulting domain gap hinder generalization to real-world scenarios. In this context, physics-grounded learning becomes crucial; however, traditional methods based on the Atmospheric Scattering Model (ASM) often fall short in handling real-world complexities and diverse haze patterns. To solve this problem, we propose HazeFlow, a novel ODE-based framework that reformulates ASM as an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Inspired by Rectified Flow (RF), HazeFlow learns an optimal ODE trajectory to map hazy images to clean ones, enhancing real-world dehazing performance with only a single inference step. Additionally, we introduce a non-homogeneous haze generation method using Markov Chain Brownian Motion (MCBM) to address the scarcity of paired real-world data. By simulating realistic haze patterns through MCBM, we enhance the adaptability of HazeFlow to diverse real-world scenarios. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that HazeFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across various real-world dehazing benchmark datasets.

Abstract: As medical diagnoses increasingly leverage multimodal data, machine learning models are expected to effectively fuse heterogeneous information while remaining robust to missing modalities. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal learning framework that integrates enhanced modalities dropout and contrastive learning to address real-world limitations such as modality imbalance and missingness. Our approach introduces learnable modality tokens for improving missingness-aware fusion of modalities and augments conventional unimodal contrastive objectives with fused multimodal representations. We validate our framework on large-scale clinical datasets for disease detection and prediction tasks, encompassing both visual and tabular modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in challenging and practical scenarios where only a single modality is available. Furthermore, we show its adaptability through successful integration with a recent CT foundation model. Our findings highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability of our approach for multimodal learning, offering a scalable, low-cost solution with significant potential for real-world clinical applications.

Summary:
<br>
1. The study evaluated 9 segmentation architectures using a dataset of 490 CTPA scans, finding that 3D U-Net with a ResNet encoder is effective for PE segmentation.
2. Due to emboli's morphological characteristics, 3D models excel at this task.
3. CNN-based models outperform ViT-based models in PE segmentation.
4. Pretraining for classification can hinder segmentation performance compared to training from scratch, indicating different feature requirements for classification and segmentation.
5. Different model architectures consistently perform similarly when trained on the same data.
6. Segmenting distal emboli remains challenging due to task complexity and limited high-quality data. The best model achieved a mean Dice score of 0.7131, accurately detecting central and large emboli with some false positives and negatives. Its generalizability was confirmed on public datasets. <br><br> <div>

Abstract: In this study, we curated a densely annotated in-house dataset comprising 490 CTPA scans. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluated nine widely used segmentation architectures from both the CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT) families, initialized with either pretrained or random weights, under a unified testing framework as a performance audit. Our study leads to several important observations: (1) 3D U-Net with a ResNet encoder remains a highly effective architecture for PE segmentation; (2) 3D models are particularly well-suited to this task given the morphological characteristics of emboli; (3) CNN-based models generally yield superior performance compared to their ViT-based counterparts in PE segmentation; (4) classification-based pretraining, even on large PE datasets, can adversely impact segmentation performance compared to training from scratch, suggesting that PE classification and segmentation may rely on different sets of discriminative features; (5) different model architectures show a highly consistent pattern of segmentation performance when trained on the same data; and (6) while central and large emboli can be segmented with satisfactory accuracy, distal emboli remain challenging due to both task complexity and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. Besides these findings, our best-performing model achieves a mean Dice score of 0.7131 for segmentation. It detects 181 emboli with 49 false positives and 28 false negatives from 60 in-house testing scans. Its generalizability is further validated on public datasets.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel graph neural network for handshape recognition in signed languages. Handshapes play a crucial role in phonology, with American Sign Language having about 50 distinct shapes. However, existing computational models do not explicitly consider handshapes, limiting accuracy in recognition and linguistic analysis. The new approach separates temporal dynamics from static handshape configurations using anatomically-informed graph structures and contrastive learning. This method addresses challenges such as subtle interclass distinctions and temporal variations. The study establishes the first benchmark for structured handshape recognition in signing sequences, achieving 46% accuracy across 37 handshape classes. Baseline methods, in contrast, achieved only 25% accuracy. This research paves the way for improved handshape recognition and analysis in signed languages.

<br>
Summary: This study explores the importance of reliable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in fetal ultrasound using deep learning models. The research focuses on the impact of the classification task on OOD detection, examining how different tasks affect uncertainty estimation and performance. Through experiments with various uncertainty quantification methods and classification tasks, the study highlights significant variability in OOD detection performance based on the task. The study emphasizes the importance of aligning task selection and uncertainty strategies with specific application scenarios in medical image analysis. The findings demonstrate that the best task for OOD detection depends on the type of OOD sample being encountered, whether it is due to an image characteristic shift or an anatomical feature shift. The study also underscores the importance of considering the balance between OOD detection accuracy and abstained prediction in ensuring safe deployment of deep learning models in fetal ultrasound. <br> <div>

Abstract: Reliable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is important for safe deployment of deep learning models in fetal ultrasound amidst heterogeneous image characteristics and clinical settings. OOD detection relies on estimating a classification model's uncertainty, which should increase for OOD samples. While existing research has largely focused on uncertainty quantification methods, this work investigates the impact of the classification task itself. Through experiments with eight uncertainty quantification methods across four classification tasks, we demonstrate that OOD detection performance significantly varies with the task, and that the best task depends on the defined ID-OOD criteria; specifically, whether the OOD sample is due to: i) an image characteristic shift or ii) an anatomical feature shift. Furthermore, we reveal that superior OOD detection does not guarantee optimal abstained prediction, underscoring the necessity to align task selection and uncertainty strategies with the specific downstream application in medical image analysis.

Additionally, a refinement technique called AdHoP is introduced, which significantly improves feature matching and reduces translation error. The dataset and code are available for access, opening up new possibilities for research and development in the field of aerial image localization. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.18350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate visual localization from aerial views is a fundamental problem with applications in mapping, large-area inspection, and search-and-rescue operations. In many scenarios, these systems require high-precision localization while operating with limited resources (e.g., no internet connection or GNSS/GPS support), making large image databases or heavy 3D models impractical. Surprisingly, little attention has been given to leveraging orthographic geodata as an alternative paradigm, which is lightweight and increasingly available through free releases by governmental authorities (e.g., the European Union). To fill this gap, we propose OrthoLoC, the first large-scale dataset comprising 16,425 UAV images from Germany and the United States with multiple modalities. The dataset addresses domain shifts between UAV imagery and geospatial data. Its paired structure enables fair benchmarking of existing solutions by decoupling image retrieval from feature matching, allowing isolated evaluation of localization and calibration performance. Through comprehensive evaluation, we examine the impact of domain shifts, data resolutions, and covisibility on localization accuracy. Finally, we introduce a refinement technique called AdHoP, which can be integrated with any feature matcher, improving matching by up to 95% and reducing translation error by up to 63%. The dataset and code are available at: https://deepscenario.github.io/OrthoLoC.

<div> Deep Image Prior, Anomaly Localization, Single Shot Decomposition Network, Convolutional Neural Networks, Image Reconstruction  
Summary:  
Single-image anomaly detection is a challenging task, especially when training data is unavailable. The proposed method, SSDnet, leverages the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks to localize anomalies in images without the need for external training data or references. By assuming that natural images exhibit unified textures and patterns, anomalies are detected as localized deviations from these patterns. The patch-based training framework allows the network to reconstruct the input image without external data, using masking, patch shuffling, and Gaussian noise to prevent an identity mapping. A perceptual loss function based on inner-product similarity captures structural information beyond pixel fidelity. SSDnet achieves high AUROC and AUPRC scores on benchmark datasets, outperforming existing methods and demonstrating robustness to noise and missing pixels. The implementation code will be made available.  
<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.18354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from collections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many real-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only the test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by proposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior (DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key assumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns, and that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or stochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based training framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for self-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in DIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking, patch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual loss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel fidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references, and remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves 0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the fabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code will be released at https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/SSDnet

<div> keywords: Bengali captioning pipeline, vision-language models, low-resource languages, synthetic images, patch alignment

Summary:
A new approach is proposed for grounding vision-language models in low-resource languages, specifically Bengali. The system is trained on verified English-Bengali pairs and synthetic images using a tri-loss objective. The tri-loss objective consists of Patch-Alignment Loss (PAL) for aligning real and synthetic patch descriptors, InfoNCE for enforcing global real-synthetic separation, and Sinkhorn-based OT for balanced patch correspondence. This synergy leads to improved grounding, reduced spurious matches, and significant performance gains on benchmark datasets such as Flickr30k-1k and MSCOCO-1k. The system outperforms strong baseline models, showcasing better BLEU-4, METEOR, and BERTScore-F1 scores. Furthermore, the real-synthetic centroid gap is narrowed by 41%, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing vision-language models for low-resource languages. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.18369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grounding vision--language models in low-resource languages remains challenging, as they often produce fluent text about the wrong objects. This stems from scarce paired data, translation pivots that break alignment, and English-centric pretraining that ignores target-language semantics. We address this with a compute-aware Bengali captioning pipeline trained on LaBSE-verified EN--BN pairs and 110k bilingual-prompted synthetic images. A frozen MaxViT yields stable visual patches, a Bengali-native mBART-50 decodes, and a lightweight bridge links the modalities. Our core novelty is a tri-loss objective: Patch-Alignment Loss (PAL) aligns real and synthetic patch descriptors using decoder cross-attention, InfoNCE enforces global real--synthetic separation, and Sinkhorn-based OT ensures balanced fine-grained patch correspondence. This PAL+InfoNCE+OT synergy improves grounding, reduces spurious matches, and drives strong gains on Flickr30k-1k (BLEU-4 12.29, METEOR 27.98, BERTScore-F1 71.20) and MSCOCO-1k (BLEU-4 12.00, METEOR 28.14, BERTScore-F1 75.40), outperforming strong CE baselines and narrowing the real--synthetic centroid gap by 41%.

Abstract: We present TinyBEV, a unified, camera only Bird's Eye View (BEV) framework that distills the full-stack capabilities of a large planning-oriented teacher (UniAD [19]) into a compact, real-time student model. Unlike prior efficient camera only baselines such as VAD[23] and VADv2[7], TinyBEV supports the complete autonomy stack 3D detection, HD-map segmentation, motion forecasting, occupancy prediction, and goal-directed planning within a streamlined 28M-parameter backbone, achieving a 78% reduction in parameters over UniAD [19]. Our model-agnostic, multi-stage distillation strategy combines feature-level, output-level, and adaptive region-aware supervision to effectively transfer high-capacity multi-modal knowledge to a lightweight BEV representation. On nuScenes[4], Tiny-BEV achieves 39.0 mAP for detection, 1.08 minADE for motion forecasting, and a 0.32 collision rate, while running 5x faster (11 FPS) and requiring only camera input. These results demonstrate that full-stack driving intelligence can be retained in resource-constrained settings, bridging the gap between large-scale, multi-modal perception-planning models and deployment-ready real-time autonomy.

<div> Keywords: motion blur, ball detection, labeling strategy, attention mechanisms, sports analytics

Summary: 
Motion blur in fast-moving objects challenges detection systems, particularly in sports like table tennis where balls appear as streaks. A new labeling strategy has been introduced, placing the ball at the center of the blur streak and annotating blur attributes to improve detection accuracy and trajectory prediction. A new dataset focusing on table tennis ball detection has been released using this strategy. The BlurBall model, incorporating attention mechanisms like Squeeze-and-Excitation over multi-frame inputs, achieves state-of-the-art results in ball detection. Leveraging motion blur not only enhances detection performance but also enables more reliable trajectory prediction for real-time sports analytics. <div>
arXiv:2509.18387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motion blur reduces the clarity of fast-moving objects, posing challenges for detection systems, especially in racket sports, where balls often appear as streaks rather than distinct points. Existing labeling conventions mark the ball at the leading edge of the blur, introducing asymmetry and ignoring valuable motion cues correlated with velocity. This paper introduces a new labeling strategy that places the ball at the center of the blur streak and explicitly annotates blur attributes. Using this convention, we release a new table tennis ball detection dataset. We demonstrate that this labeling approach consistently enhances detection performance across various models. Furthermore, we introduce BlurBall, a model that jointly estimates ball position and motion blur attributes. By incorporating attention mechanisms such as Squeeze-and-Excitation over multi-frame inputs, we achieve state-of-the-art results in ball detection. Leveraging blur not only improves detection accuracy but also enables more reliable trajectory prediction, benefiting real-time sports analytics.

<div> Motion vectors, open-vocabulary detector, keyframes, video frames, detector invocations
<br>
Summary:
The article introduces a training-free pipeline for video analysis that utilizes compressed-domain motion vectors to propagate detections from fixed-interval keyframes to intermediate frames. This method, termed MVP, achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.609 at IoU threshold of 0.5 and 0.316 at IoU range [0.5:0.95] on the ILSVRC2015-VID dataset. MVP maintains close performance to framewise OWLv2-Large at loose IoU thresholds and outperforms tracker-based propagation algorithms. Compared to a supervised YOLOv12x reference, MVP achieves competitive results without requiring labeled training data. The approach demonstrates the practicality of using compressed-domain propagation to reduce detector invocations in videos while maintaining strong zero-shot coverage. The code and models for MVP are publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/microa/MVP.

Abstract: Running a large open-vocabulary (Open-vocab) detector on every video frame is accurate but expensive. We introduce a training-free pipeline that invokes OWLv2 only on fixed-interval keyframes and propagates detections to intermediate frames using compressed-domain motion vectors (MV). A simple 3x3 grid aggregation of motion vectors provides translation and uniform-scale updates, augmented with an area-growth check and an optional single-class switch. The method requires no labels, no fine-tuning, and uses the same prompt list for all open-vocabulary methods. On ILSVRC2015-VID (validation dataset), our approach (MVP) attains mAP@0.5=0.609 and mAP@[0.5:0.95]=0.316. At loose intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds it remains close to framewise OWLv2-Large (0.747/0.721 at 0.2/0.3 versus 0.784/0.780), reflecting that coarse localization is largely preserved. Under the same keyframe schedule, MVP outperforms tracker-based propagation (MOSSE, KCF, CSRT) at mAP@0.5. A supervised reference (YOLOv12x) reaches 0.631 at mAP@0.5 but requires labeled training, whereas our method remains label-free and open-vocabulary. These results indicate that compressed-domain propagation is a practical way to reduce detector invocations while keeping strong zero-shot coverage in videos. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/microa/MVP.

Summary: <br>
This study explores the color robustness of single-image HDR lighting estimation methods for augmented reality applications. It focuses on isolating color as a key factor in achieving visual realism. By employing adaptation techniques on existing models without retraining, the study demonstrates that preprocessing input images with a pre-trained white balance network significantly improves color accuracy. This approach outperforms other strategies in diverse lighting scenarios. The findings are validated on three recent state-of-the-art lighting estimation methods. The research showcases the importance of considering color as a separate variable in lighting estimation for realistic AR rendering and compositing of virtual objects. <div>

Abstract: Advances in high dynamic range (HDR) lighting estimation from a single image have opened new possibilities for augmented reality (AR) applications. Predicting complex lighting environments from a single input image allows for the realistic rendering and compositing of virtual objects. In this work, we investigate the color robustness of such methods -- an often overlooked yet critical factor for achieving visual realism. While most evaluations conflate color with other lighting attributes (e.g., intensity, direction), we isolate color as the primary variable of interest. Rather than introducing a new lighting estimation algorithm, we explore whether simple adaptation techniques can enhance the color accuracy of existing models. Using a novel HDR dataset featuring diverse lighting colors, we systematically evaluate several adaptation strategies. Our results show that preprocessing the input image with a pre-trained white balance network improves color robustness, outperforming other strategies across all tested scenarios. Notably, this approach requires no retraining of the lighting estimation model. We further validate the generality of this finding by applying the technique to three state-of-the-art lighting estimation methods from recent literature.

<br>
Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel framework for automated check field detection that does not require training. By utilizing a vision language model and a multimodal large language model, the system can identify critical fields on checks, such as signatures and amounts, without the need for extensive labeled datasets. The framework is designed to be easily deployable in real-world financial environments and can adapt to various check formats and layouts. Evaluation on a dataset of 110 checks shows strong performance and generalization capabilities. Additionally, this framework can be used to generate high-quality labeled datasets, making it easier to develop specialized object detection models for financial institutions.<br><br> <div>

Abstract: Checks remain a foundational instrument in the financial ecosystem, facilitating substantial transaction volumes across institutions. However, their continued use also renders them a persistent target for fraud, underscoring the importance of robust check fraud detection mechanisms. At the core of such systems lies the accurate identification and localization of critical fields, such as the signature, magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line, courtesy amount, legal amount, payee, and payer, which are essential for subsequent verification against reference checks belonging to the same customer. This field-level detection is traditionally dependent on object detection models trained on large, diverse, and meticulously labeled datasets, a resource that is scarce due to proprietary and privacy concerns. In this paper, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for automated check field detection, leveraging the power of a vision language model (VLM) in conjunction with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our approach enables zero-shot detection of check components, significantly lowering the barrier to deployment in real-world financial settings. Quantitative evaluation of our model on a hand-curated dataset of 110 checks spanning multiple formats and layouts demonstrates strong performance and generalization capability. Furthermore, this framework can serve as a bootstrap mechanism for generating high-quality labeled datasets, enabling the development of specialized real-time object detection models tailored to institutional needs.

CHART NOISe evaluates the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on chart understanding, revealing vulnerabilities such as value fabrication and entity confusion under corruptions and occlusions. Existing benchmarks do not account for these real-world challenges. CHART NOISe introduces a dataset that includes chart corruptions, occlusions, and reverse inconsistency questions inspired by Korea's CSAT English section. The dataset aims to improve the robustness and reliability of chart understanding models by testing their reasoning abilities in noisy and occluded environments. Baseline mitigation strategies such as quality filtering and occlusion detection are proposed to address these challenges. The study benchmarks state-of-the-art VLMs, identifies their shortcomings, and provides a framework for enhancing chart understanding models' performance in adverse conditions.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) show strong results on chart understanding, yet existing benchmarks assume clean figures and fact based queries. Real world charts often contain distortions and demand reasoning beyond simple matching. We evaluate ChatGPT 4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, finding sharp performance drops under corruption or occlusion, with hallucinations such as value fabrication, trend misinterpretation, and entity confusion becoming more frequent. Models remain overconfident in degraded settings, generating plausible but unsupported explanations.
  To address this gap, we introduce CHART NOISe(Chart Hallucinations, Answers, and Reasoning Testing on Noisy and Occluded Input Selections), a dataset combining chart corruptions, occlusions, and exam style multiple choice questions inspired by Korea's CSAT English section. A key innovation is prompt reverse inconsistency, where models contradict themselves when asked to confirm versus deny the same statement. Our contributions are threefold: (1) benchmarking state of the art VLMs, exposing systematic vulnerabilities in chart reasoning; (2) releasing CHART NOISe, the first dataset unifying corruption, occlusion, and reverse inconsistency; and (3) proposing baseline mitigation strategies such as quality filtering and occlusion detection. Together, these efforts establish a rigorous testbed for advancing robustness and reliability in chart understanding.

Summary:
A new neural representation framework for 4D-MRI has been developed that captures respiratory-induced motion in radiation therapy planning more effectively. This framework integrates motion modeling and image reconstruction using two networks: the Spatial Anatomy Network (SAN) encodes 3D anatomical representation, while the Temporal Motion Network (TMN) produces consistent deformation fields guided by respiratory signals. This method eliminates the need for traditional discrete sorting approaches, enhancing efficiency and reducing processing time significantly. The framework accurately reconstructs 3D images at any respiratory state, maintaining high anatomical fidelity and preserving vessel and bronchial continuity. It outperforms conventional methods in capturing regular and irregular respiratory patterns. The new approach shows promise for real-time adaptive treatment in 4D radiation therapy planning. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.18427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-dimensional MRI (4D-MRI) is an promising technique for capturing respiratory-induced motion in radiation therapy planning and delivery. Conventional 4D reconstruction methods, which typically rely on phase binning or separate template scans, struggle to capture temporal variability, complicate workflows, and impose heavy computational loads. We introduce a neural representation framework that considers respiratory motion as a smooth, continuous deformation steered by a 1D surrogate signal, completely replacing the conventional discrete sorting approach. The new method fuses motion modeling with image reconstruction through two synergistic networks: the Spatial Anatomy Network (SAN) encodes a continuous 3D anatomical representation, while a Temporal Motion Network (TMN), guided by Transformer-derived respiratory signals, produces temporally consistent deformation fields. Evaluation using a free-breathing dataset of 19 volunteers demonstrates that our template- and phase-free method accurately captures both regular and irregular respiratory patterns, while preserving vessel and bronchial continuity with high anatomical fidelity. The proposed method significantly improves efficiency, reducing the total processing time from approximately five hours required by conventional discrete sorting methods to just 15 minutes of training. Furthermore, it enables inference of each 3D volume in under one second. The framework accurately reconstructs 3D images at any respiratory state, achieves superior performance compared to conventional methods, and demonstrates strong potential for application in 4D radiation therapy planning and real-time adaptive treatment.

<br>
Summary: <br>
The study evaluates five Kalman filter-based tracking methods for tracking fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs, crucial for sport robotics applications. The methods are tested on a custom dataset to assess their performance in terms of tracking accuracy and reliability. DeepOCSORT proves to have the lowest tracking error, while ByteTrack shows the fastest processing speed. However, all methods exhibit significant tracking drift with spatial errors, indicating limitations in handling the unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving objects like racquetballs. Current tracking approaches fall short compared to standard object tracking benchmarks, emphasizing the need for specialized methodologies in tracking fast-moving tiny objects effectively. <div>
arXiv:2509.18451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unpredictable movement patterns and small visual mark make precise tracking of fast-moving tiny objects like a racquetball one of the challenging problems in computer vision. This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors: inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms. However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values: 31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs. Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving tiny object tracking applications.

Summary:<br>
The article introduces MoCrop, a motion-aware adaptive cropping module designed for efficient video action recognition in the compressed domain. MoCrop utilizes motion vectors available in H.264 video to identify motion-dense regions and generate a single clip-level crop that is applied to all I-frames during inference.

MoCrop uses motion vectors that are available in H.264 video to locate motion-dense regions and produces a single clip-level crop that is applied to all I-frames at inference. The module is training free, adds no parameters, and can be plugged into diverse backbones. A lightweight pipeline that includes denoising & merge (DM), Monte Carlo sampling (MCS), and adaptive cropping (AC) via a motion-density submatrix search yields robust crops with negligible overhead. On UCF101, MoCrop improves accuracy or reduces compute. With ResNet-50, it delivers +3.5% Top-1 accuracy at equal FLOPs (attention setting), or +2.4% Top-1 accuracy with 26.5% fewer FLOPs (efficiency setting). Applied to CoViAR, it reaches 89.2% Top-1 accuracy at the original cost and 88.5% Top-1 accuracy while reducing compute from 11.6 to 8.5 GFLOPs. Consistent gains on MobileNet-V3, EfficientNet-B1, and Swin-B indicate strong generality and make MoCrop practical for real-time deployment in the compressed domain.

Summary:
CAFC-SE is a framework for coding images at minimal bitrate and maintaining strong analysis performance in edge-cloud systems. It uses Vector Quantization (VQ) to map visual features to discrete indices with a codebook at the edge, preserving informative visual patterns under low-bitrate conditions. By selectively transmitting compressed features to the cloud, CAFC-SE reduces redundancy and over-concentration of symbol distributions, making it less vulnerable to low-bitrate scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of CAFC-SE in terms of rate and accuracy, showcasing its effectiveness in efficiently coding images for machine analysis in edge-cloud systems.

Abstract: Coding images for machines with minimal bitrate and strong analysis performance is key to effective edge-cloud systems. Several approaches deploy an image codec and perform analysis on the reconstructed image. Other methods compress intermediate features using entropy models and subsequently perform analysis on the decoded features. Nevertheless, these methods both perform poorly under low-bitrate conditions, as they retain many redundant details or learn over-concentrated symbol distributions. In this paper, we propose a Codebook-based Adaptive Feature Compression framework with Semantic Enhancement, named CAFC-SE. It maps continuous visual features to discrete indices with a codebook at the edge via Vector Quantization (VQ) and selectively transmits them to the cloud. The VQ operation that projects feature vectors onto the nearest visual primitives enables us to preserve more informative visual patterns under low-bitrate conditions. Hence, CAFC-SE is less vulnerable to low-bitrate conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of rate and accuracy.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MK-UNet, a paradigm shift towards ultra-lightweight, multi-kernel U-shaped CNNs tailored for medical image segmentation. Central to MK-UNet is the multi-kernel depth-wise convolution block (MKDC) we design to adeptly process images through multiple kernels, while capturing complex multi-resolution spatial relationships. MK-UNet also emphasizes the images salient features through sophisticated attention mechanisms, including channel, spatial, and grouped gated attention. Our MK-UNet network, with a modest computational footprint of only 0.316M parameters and 0.314G FLOPs, represents not only a remarkably lightweight, but also significantly improved segmentation solution that provides higher accuracy over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across six binary medical imaging benchmarks. Specifically, MK-UNet outperforms TransUNet in DICE score with nearly 333$\times$ and 123$\times$ fewer parameters and FLOPs, respectively. Similarly, when compared against UNeXt, MK-UNet exhibits superior segmentation performance, improving the DICE score up to 6.7% margins while operating with 4.7$\times$ fewer #Params. Our MK-UNet also outperforms other recent lightweight networks, such as MedT, CMUNeXt, EGE-UNet, and Rolling-UNet, with much lower computational resources. This leap in performance, coupled with drastic computational gains, positions MK-UNet as an unparalleled solution for real-time, high-fidelity medical diagnostics in resource-limited settings, such as point-of-care devices.

<div> Keywords: unsupervised domain adaptation, semantic segmentation, remote sensing images, source-free domain adaptation, pseudo-label optimization

Summary: 
Diffusion-Guided Label Enrichment (DGLE) is proposed to improve pseudo-label quality in source-free domain adaptation for semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. The method begins with obtaining high-quality pseudo-labels through a fusion method based on confidence filtering and super-resolution enhancement. These initial seeds are then propagated using a diffusion model to generate complete and high-quality pseudo-labels. By leveraging the denoising capability and modeling capacity of the diffusion model, DGLE effectively enhances the quality of pseudo-labels, avoiding the challenges of directly optimizing a complete set. This approach significantly boosts the model's performance in the target domain, overcoming limitations in self-training methods commonly used in source-free domain adaptation. <div>
arXiv:2509.18502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation of remote sensing images has been extensively conducted. However, research on how to achieve domain adaptation in practical scenarios where source domain data is inaccessible namely, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) remains limited. Self-training has been widely used in SFDA, which requires obtaining as many high-quality pseudo-labels as possible to train models on target domain data. Most existing methods optimize the entire pseudo-label set to obtain more supervisory information. However, as pseudo-label sets often contain substantial noise, simultaneously optimizing all labels is challenging. This limitation undermines the effectiveness of optimization approaches and thus restricts the performance of self-training. To address this, we propose a novel pseudo-label optimization framework called Diffusion-Guided Label Enrichment (DGLE), which starts from a few easily obtained high-quality pseudo-labels and propagates them to a complete set of pseudo-labels while ensuring the quality of newly generated labels. Firstly, a pseudo-label fusion method based on confidence filtering and super-resolution enhancement is proposed, which utilizes cross-validation of details and contextual information to obtain a small number of high-quality pseudo-labels as initial seeds. Then, we leverage the diffusion model to propagate incomplete seed pseudo-labels with irregular distributions due to its strong denoising capability for randomly distributed noise and powerful modeling capacity for complex distributions, thereby generating complete and high-quality pseudo-labels. This method effectively avoids the difficulty of directly optimizing the complete set of pseudo-labels, significantly improves the quality of pseudo-labels, and thus enhances the model's performance in the target domain.

Abstract: In the field of machine learning, hyperbolic space demonstrates superior representation capabilities for hierarchical data compared to conventional Euclidean space. This work focuses on the Coarse-To-Fine Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (C2FSCIL) task. Our study follows the Knowe approach, which contrastively learns coarse class labels and subsequently normalizes and freezes the classifier weights of learned fine classes in the embedding space. To better interpret the "coarse-to-fine" paradigm, we propose embedding the feature extractor into hyperbolic space. Specifically, we employ the Poincar\'e ball model of hyperbolic space, enabling the feature extractor to transform input images into feature vectors within the Poincar\'e ball instead of Euclidean space. We further introduce hyperbolic contrastive loss and hyperbolic fully-connected layers to facilitate model optimization and classification in hyperbolic space. Additionally, to enhance performance under few-shot conditions, we implement maximum entropy distribution in hyperbolic space to estimate the probability distribution of fine-class feature vectors. This allows generation of augmented features from the distribution to mitigate overfitting during training with limited samples. Experiments on C2FSCIL benchmarks show that our method effectively improves both coarse and fine class accuracies.

<div> Keywords: intelligent image editing, object removal, causal visual artifacts, geometry-aware framework, photorealistic rendering

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach for intelligent image editing that aims to remove objects and their causal visual artifacts, such as shadows and reflections. The proposed two-stage framework decouples object removal into geometry removal and appearance rendering. In the first stage, the object is removed directly from the geometry using strict mask-aligned supervision, allowing for structure-aware editing with strong geometric constraints. In the second stage, a photorealistic RGB image is rendered based on the updated geometry, considering causal visual effects as a result of the modified 3D geometry. The method employs a preference-driven objective based on positive and negative sample pairs to guide learning in the geometry removal stage, ensuring removal of objects and their associated artifacts while avoiding new structural insertions. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in removing objects and their artifacts on popular benchmarks. The code is available for implementation. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Towards intelligent image editing, object removal should eliminate both the target object and its causal visual artifacts, such as shadows and reflections. However, existing image appearance-based methods either follow strictly mask-aligned training and fail to remove these causal effects which are not explicitly masked, or adopt loosely mask-aligned strategies that lack controllability and may unintentionally over-erase other objects. We identify that these limitations stem from ignoring the causal relationship between an object's geometry presence and its visual effects. To address this limitation, we propose a geometry-aware two-stage framework that decouples object removal into (1) geometry removal and (2) appearance rendering. In the first stage, we remove the object directly from the geometry (e.g., depth) using strictly mask-aligned supervision, enabling structure-aware editing with strong geometric constraints. In the second stage, we render a photorealistic RGB image conditioned on the updated geometry, where causal visual effects are considered implicitly as a result of the modified 3D geometry. To guide learning in the geometry removal stage, we introduce a preference-driven objective based on positive and negative sample pairs, encouraging the model to remove objects as well as their causal visual artifacts while avoiding new structural insertions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing both objects and their associated artifacts on two popular benchmarks.

Summary: 
Adversarial attacks against No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) models have been a concern, especially in black-box scenarios where the attacker does not have access to the target model. Existing attacks lack transferability to unknown target models, limiting their effectiveness. In this study, a new approach called the Signed Ensemble Gaussian black-box Attack (SEGA) is proposed to enhance transferability in attacking NR-IQA models. SEGA approximates the target model's gradient by smoothing gradients from multiple source models and filtering inappropriate perturbations to ensure imperceptibility. Experimental results on the CLIVE dataset demonstrate SEGA's superior transferability, showcasing its effectiveness in facilitating successful transfer-based black-box attacks against NR-IQA models. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) models play an important role in various real-world applications. Recently, adversarial attacks against NR-IQA models have attracted increasing attention, as they provide valuable insights for revealing model vulnerabilities and guiding robust system design. Some effective attacks have been proposed against NR-IQA models in white-box settings, where the attacker has full access to the target model. However, these attacks often suffer from poor transferability to unknown target models in more realistic black-box scenarios, where the target model is inaccessible. This work makes the first attempt to address the challenge of low transferability in attacking NR-IQA models by proposing a transferable Signed Ensemble Gaussian black-box Attack (SEGA). The main idea is to approximate the gradient of the target model by applying Gaussian smoothing to source models and ensembling their smoothed gradients. To ensure the imperceptibility of adversarial perturbations, SEGA further removes inappropriate perturbations using a specially designed perturbation filter mask. Experimental results on the CLIVE dataset demonstrate the superior transferability of SEGA, validating its effectiveness in enabling successful transfer-based black-box attacks against NR-IQA models.

Abstract: The distinction between genuine and posed emotions represents a fundamental pattern recognition challenge with significant implications for data mining applications in social sciences, healthcare, and human-computer interaction. While recent multi-task learning frameworks have shown promise in combining deep learning architectures with handcrafted D-Marker features for smile facial emotion recognition, these approaches exhibit computational inefficiencies due to auxiliary task supervision and complex loss balancing requirements. This paper introduces HadaSmileNet, a novel feature fusion framework that directly integrates transformer-based representations with physiologically grounded D-Markers through parameter-free multiplicative interactions. Through systematic evaluation of 15 fusion strategies, we demonstrate that Hadamard multiplicative fusion achieves optimal performance by enabling direct feature interactions while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed approach establishes new state-of-the-art results for deep learning methods across four benchmark datasets: UvA-NEMO (88.7 percent, +0.8), MMI (99.7 percent), SPOS (98.5 percent, +0.7), and BBC (100 percent, +5.0). Comprehensive computational analysis reveals 26 percent parameter reduction and simplified training compared to multi-task alternatives, while feature visualization demonstrates enhanced discriminative power through direct domain knowledge integration. The framework's efficiency and effectiveness make it particularly suitable for practical deployment in multimedia data mining applications that require real-time affective computing capabilities.

<div> Keywords: dynamic humans, event cameras, 3D Gaussian Splatting, motion blur, human-scene reconstruction

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic humans and static scenes from monocular videos using event cameras. By utilizing 3D Gaussian Splatting, the framework jointly models humans and scenes, with a focus on high-speed motion scenarios. A unified set of 3D Gaussians is employed, with learnable semantic attributes for accurate reconstruction. To address motion blur, an event-guided loss function is proposed to improve local fidelity in fast-moving regions. The approach eliminates the need for external human masks and simplifies Gaussian management. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in human-scene reconstruction, outperforming strong baselines in metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS, particularly for high-speed subjects. <div>

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic humans together with static scenes from monocular videos remains difficult, especially under fast motion, where RGB frames suffer from motion blur. Event cameras exhibit distinct advantages, e.g., microsecond temporal resolution, making them a superior sensing choice for dynamic human reconstruction. Accordingly, we present a novel event-guided human-scene reconstruction framework that jointly models human and scene from a single monocular event camera via 3D Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, a unified set of 3D Gaussians carries a learnable semantic attribute; only Gaussians classified as human undergo deformation for animation, while scene Gaussians stay static. To combat blur, we propose an event-guided loss that matches simulated brightness changes between consecutive renderings with the event stream, improving local fidelity in fast-moving regions. Our approach removes the need for external human masks and simplifies managing separate Gaussian sets. On two benchmark datasets, ZJU-MoCap-Blur and MMHPSD-Blur, it delivers state-of-the-art human-scene reconstruction, with notable gains over strong baselines in PSNR/SSIM and reduced LPIPS, especially for high-speed subjects.

Summary: <br>
The article introduces Live-E2T, a framework for real-time threat monitoring in video streams. It addresses the challenge of balancing real-time performance with decision explainability. Live-E2T deconstructs video frames into structured semantic tuples, providing a focused representation for improved analysis. It incorporates an online event deduplication mechanism to filter redundancies and ensure system responsiveness. The framework utilizes a Large Language Model for logical reasoning over event sequences, producing coherent threat assessment reports. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that Live-E2T outperforms existing methods in threat detection accuracy, real-time efficiency, and explainability. The framework's innovative approach to semantic analysis, event deduplication, and reasoning capabilities make it a promising solution for real-time threat monitoring applications. <br> <div>

Abstract: Real-time threat monitoring identifies threatening behaviors in video streams and provides reasoning and assessment of threat events through explanatory text. However, prevailing methodologies, whether based on supervised learning or generative models, struggle to concurrently satisfy the demanding requirements of real-time performance and decision explainability. To bridge this gap, we introduce Live-E2T, a novel framework that unifies these two objectives through three synergistic mechanisms. First, we deconstruct video frames into structured Human-Object-Interaction-Place semantic tuples. This approach creates a compact, semantically focused representation, circumventing the information degradation common in conventional feature compression. Second, an efficient online event deduplication and updating mechanism is proposed to filter spatio-temporal redundancies, ensuring the system's real time responsiveness. Finally, we fine-tune a Large Language Model using a Chain-of-Thought strategy, endow it with the capability for transparent and logical reasoning over event sequences to produce coherent threat assessment reports. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including XD-Violence and UCF-Crime, demonstrate that Live-E2T significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of threat detection accuracy, real-time efficiency, and the crucial dimension of explainability.

Summary:<br><br>Researchers have identified a gap in the visual understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) between general and aesthetic elements. To address this, they introduce a novel dataset called PhotoCritique, created through discussions among photographers. They propose a model, PhotoEye, that incorporates language guidance and multi-view vision fusion to enhance aesthetics understanding. Additionally, they introduce a benchmark, PhotoBench, to evaluate aesthetic visual understanding. The model shows significant improvements over existing models on both existing benchmarks and PhotoBench. <div>

Abstract: While editing directly from life, photographers have found it too difficult to see simultaneously both the blue and the sky. Photographer and curator, Szarkowski insightfully revealed one of the notable gaps between general and aesthetic visual understanding: while the former focuses on identifying the factual element in an image (sky), the latter transcends such object identification, viewing it instead as an aesthetic component--a pure color block (blue). Such fundamental distinctions between general (detection, localization, etc.) and aesthetic (color, lighting, composition, etc.) visual understanding present a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Although some recent works have made initial explorations, they are often limited to general and basic aesthetic commonsense. As a result, they frequently fall short in real-world scenarios (Fig. 1), which require extensive expertise--including photographic techniques, photo pre/post-processing knowledge, and more, to provide a detailed analysis and description. To fundamentally enhance the aesthetics understanding of MLLMs, we first introduce a novel dataset, PhotoCritique, derived from extensive discussions among professional photographers and enthusiasts, and characterized by the large scale, expertise, and diversity. Then, to better learn visual aesthetics from PhotoCritique, we furthur propose a novel model, PhotoEye, featuring a languageguided multi-view vision fusion mechanism to understand image aesthetics from multiple perspectives. Finally, we present a novel benchmark, PhotoBench, a comprehensive and professional benchmark for aesthetic visual understanding. On existing benchmarks and PhotoBench, our model demonstrates clear advantages over existing models.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach called the Spatial-Semantic Consistent Model (SSCM) for Multi-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging super-resolution (MC-MRI SR) to improve imaging efficiency while maintaining spatial-semantic consistency. The SSCM integrates three key components: a Dynamic Spatial Warping Module for spatial alignment, a Semantic-Aware Token Aggregation Block for semantic consistency, and a Spatial-Frequency Fusion Block for fine structure restoration. Experimental results demonstrate that the SSCM outperforms conventional methods in achieving state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters, producing spatially and semantically consistent reconstructions on public and private datasets. <div>

Abstract: Multi-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging super-resolution (MC-MRI SR) aims to enhance low-resolution (LR) contrasts leveraging high-resolution (HR) references, shortening acquisition time and improving imaging efficiency while preserving anatomical details. The main challenge lies in maintaining spatial-semantic consistency, ensuring anatomical structures remain well-aligned and coherent despite structural discrepancies and motion between the target and reference images. Conventional methods insufficiently model spatial-semantic consistency and underuse frequency-domain information, which leads to poor fine-grained alignment and inadequate recovery of high-frequency details. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Semantic Consistent Model (SSCM), which integrates a Dynamic Spatial Warping Module for inter-contrast spatial alignment, a Semantic-Aware Token Aggregation Block for long-range semantic consistency, and a Spatial-Frequency Fusion Block for fine structure restoration. Experiments on public and private datasets show that SSCM achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters while ensuring spatially and semantically consistent reconstructions.

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to automatically produce clinically faithful reports from chest X-ray images. Prevailing work typically follows a scale-driven paradigm, by multi-stage training over large paired corpora and oversized backbones, making pipelines highly data- and compute-intensive. In this paper, we propose Oracle-educated GRPO {OraPO) with a FactScore-based reward (FactS) to tackle the RRG task under constrained budgets. OraPO enables single-stage, RL-only training by converting failed GRPO explorations on rare or difficult studies into direct preference supervision via a lightweight oracle step. FactS grounds learning in diagnostic evidence by extracting atomic clinical facts and checking entailment against ground-truth labels, yielding dense, interpretable sentence-level rewards. Together, OraPO and FactS create a compact and powerful framework that significantly improves learning efficiency on clinically challenging cases, setting the new SOTA performance on the CheXpert Plus dataset (0.341 in F1) with 2--3 orders of magnitude less training data using a small base VLM on modest hardware.

<br>
Summary: 
Adaptive Multi-Style Fusion (AMSF) is a training-free framework that allows for the controllable fusion of multiple reference styles in diffusion models. Existing methods are limited to accepting only one style image, hindering hybrid aesthetics and scalability to multiple styles. AMSF addresses these challenges by encoding all style images and textual hints with a semantic token decomposition module, which is injected into every cross-attention layer of a frozen diffusion model. A similarity-aware re-weighting module then recalibrates the attention allocated to each style component at each denoising step, resulting in balanced and user-controlled blends without the need for fine-tuning or external adapters. AMSF outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and its fusion design can seamlessly scale to incorporating two or more styles. This work represents a practical advancement towards expressive multi-style generation in diffusion models. <div>

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Multi-Style Fusion (AMSF), a reference-based training-free framework that enables controllable fusion of multiple reference styles in diffusion models. Most of the existing reference-based methods are limited by (a) acceptance of only one style image, thus prohibiting hybrid aesthetics and scalability to more styles, and (b) lack of a principled mechanism to balance several stylistic influences. AMSF mitigates these challenges by encoding all style images and textual hints with a semantic token decomposition module that is adaptively injected into every cross-attention layer of an frozen diffusion model. A similarity-aware re-weighting module then recalibrates, at each denoising step, the attention allocated to every style component, yielding balanced and user-controllable blends without any fine-tuning or external adapters. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that AMSF produces multi-style fusion results that consistently outperform the state-of-the-art approaches, while its fusion design scales seamlessly to two or more styles. These capabilities position AMSF as a practical step toward expressive multi-style generation in diffusion models.

Summary:
MLF-4DRCNet is a novel framework for 3D object detection that integrates 4D millimeter-wave radar and camera images through multi-level fusion. The model addresses the sparsity and noise in radar point clouds to enhance feature representation. It consists of the Enhanced Radar Point Encoder (ERPE), Hierarchical Scene Fusion Pooling (HSFP), and Proposal-Level Fusion Enhancement (PLFE) modules. ERPE encodes radar point clouds into voxels using the Triple-Attention Voxel Feature Encoder. HSFP dynamically integrates voxel and image features to capture scene context, while PLFE refines region proposals by fusing image features. Experimental results on VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets show that MLF-4DRCNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, comparable to LiDAR-based models on the VoD dataset. This framework demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-level fusion in improving object detection in autonomous driving applications.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: The emerging 4D millimeter-wave radar, measuring the range, azimuth, elevation, and Doppler velocity of objects, is recognized for its cost-effectiveness and robustness in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, its point clouds exhibit significant sparsity and noise, restricting its standalone application in 3D object detection. Recent 4D radar-camera fusion methods have provided effective perception. Most existing approaches, however, adopt explicit Bird's-Eye-View fusion paradigms originally designed for LiDAR-camera fusion, neglecting radar's inherent drawbacks. Specifically, they overlook the sparse and incomplete geometry of radar point clouds and restrict fusion to coarse scene-level integration. To address these problems, we propose MLF-4DRCNet, a novel two-stage framework for 3D object detection via multi-level fusion of 4D radar and camera images. Our model incorporates the point-, scene-, and proposal-level multi-modal information, enabling comprehensive feature representation. It comprises three crucial components: the Enhanced Radar Point Encoder (ERPE) module, the Hierarchical Scene Fusion Pooling (HSFP) module, and the Proposal-Level Fusion Enhancement (PLFE) module. Operating at the point-level, ERPE densities radar point clouds with 2D image instances and encodes them into voxels via the proposed Triple-Attention Voxel Feature Encoder. HSFP dynamically integrates multi-scale voxel features with 2D image features using deformable attention to capture scene context and adopts pooling to the fused features. PLFE refines region proposals by fusing image features, and further integrates with the pooled features from HSFP. Experimental results on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that MLF-4DRCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it attains performance comparable to LiDAR-based models on the VoD dataset.

Summary:  
- The article introduces a novel framework called Prompt-Guided Dual Latent Steering (PDLS) for inverting corrupted images into the latent space of diffusion models.  
- PDLS decomposes the inversion process into a structural path and a semantic path guided by a prompt.  
- The dual guidance is formulated as an optimal control problem and solved using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR).  
- The controller dynamically steers the generative trajectory to prevent semantic drift while preserving fine details without requiring per-image optimization.

Abstract: Inverting corrupted images into the latent space of diffusion models is challenging. Current methods, which encode an image into a single latent vector, struggle to balance structural fidelity with semantic accuracy, leading to reconstructions with semantic drift, such as blurred details or incorrect attributes. To overcome this, we introduce Prompt-Guided Dual Latent Steering (PDLS), a novel, training-free framework built upon Rectified Flow models for their stable inversion paths. PDLS decomposes the inversion process into two complementary streams: a structural path to preserve source integrity and a semantic path guided by a prompt. We formulate this dual guidance as an optimal control problem and derive a closed-form solution via a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). This controller dynamically steers the generative trajectory at each step, preventing semantic drift while ensuring the preservation of fine detail without costly, per-image optimization. Extensive experiments on FFHQ-1K and ImageNet-1K under various inversion tasks, including Gaussian deblurring, motion deblurring, super-resolution and freeform inpainting, demonstrate that PDLS produces reconstructions that are both more faithful to the original image and better aligned with the semantic information than single-latent baselines.

Abstract: Neuroimaging is a ubiquitous tool for evaluating patients with neurological diseases. The global demand for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies has risen steadily, placing significant strain on health systems, prolonging turnaround times, and intensifying physician burnout \cite{Chen2017-bt, Rula2024-qp-1}. These challenges disproportionately impact patients in low-resource and rural settings. Here, we utilized a large academic health system as a data engine to develop Prima, the first vision language model (VLM) serving as an AI foundation for neuroimaging that supports real-world, clinical MRI studies as input. Trained on over 220,000 MRI studies, Prima uses a hierarchical vision architecture that provides general and transferable MRI features. Prima was tested in a 1-year health system-wide study that included 30K MRI studies. Across 52 radiologic diagnoses from the major neurologic disorders, including neoplastic, inflammatory, infectious, and developmental lesions, Prima achieved a mean diagnostic area under the ROC curve of 92.0, outperforming other state-of-the-art general and medical AI models. Prima offers explainable differential diagnoses, worklist priority for radiologists, and clinical referral recommendations across diverse patient demographics and MRI systems. Prima demonstrates algorithmic fairness across sensitive groups and can help mitigate health system biases, such as prolonged turnaround times for low-resource populations. These findings highlight the transformative potential of health system-scale VLMs and Prima's role in advancing AI-driven healthcare.

<title>Understanding-in-Generation: Reinforcing Generative Capability of Unified Model via Infusing Understanding into Generation</title>

Abstract: Recent works have made notable advancements in enhancing unified models for text-to-image generation through the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, these reasoning methods separate the processes of understanding and generation, which limits their ability to guide the reasoning of unified models in addressing the deficiencies of their generative capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel reasoning framework for unified models, Understanding-in-Generation (UiG), which harnesses the robust understanding capabilities of unified models to reinforce their performance in image generation. The core insight of our UiG is to integrate generative guidance by the strong understanding capabilities during the reasoning process, thereby mitigating the limitations of generative abilities. To achieve this, we introduce "Image Editing" as a bridge to infuse understanding into the generation process. Initially, we verify the generated image and incorporate the understanding of unified models into the editing instructions. Subsequently, we enhance the generated image step by step, gradually infusing the understanding into the generation process. Our UiG framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement in text-to-image generation over existing text-to-image reasoning methods, e.g., a 3.92% gain on the long prompt setting of the TIIF benchmark.

Abstract: Monocular relative and metric depth estimation has seen a tremendous boost in the last few years due to the sharp advancements in foundation models and in particular transformer based networks. As we start to see applications to the domain of endoscopic images, there is still a lack of robust benchmarks and high-quality datasets in that area. This paper addresses these limitations by presenting a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art (metric and relative) depth estimation models evaluated on real, unseen endoscopic images, providing critical insights into their generalisation and performance in clinical scenarios. Additionally, we introduce and publish a novel synthetic dataset (EndoSynth) of endoscopic surgical instruments paired with ground truth metric depth and segmentation masks, designed to bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world data. We demonstrate that fine-tuning depth foundation models using our synthetic dataset boosts accuracy on most unseen real data by a significant margin. By providing both a benchmark and a synthetic dataset, this work advances the field of depth estimation for endoscopic images and serves as an important resource for future research. Project page, EndoSynth dataset and trained weights are available at https://github.com/TouchSurgery/EndoSynth.

Abstract: RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) aims to identify the most conspicuous objects in a scene with the incorporation of depth cues. Existing methods mainly rely on CNNs, limited by the local receptive fields, or Vision Transformers that suffer from the cost of quadratic complexity, posing a challenge in balancing performance and computational efficiency. Recently, state space models (SSM), Mamba, have shown great potential for modeling long-range dependency with linear complexity. However, directly applying SSM to RGB-D SOD may lead to deficient local semantics as well as the inadequate cross-modality fusion. To address these issues, we propose a Local Emphatic and Adaptive Fusion state space model (LEAF-Mamba) that contains two novel components: 1) a local emphatic state space module (LE-SSM) to capture multi-scale local dependencies for both modalities. 2) an SSM-based adaptive fusion module (AFM) for complementary cross-modality interaction and reliable cross-modality integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LEAF-Mamba consistently outperforms 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods in both efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, our method can achieve excellent performance on the RGB-T SOD task, proving a powerful generalization ability.

Abstract: With the rapid development of society and continuous advances in science and technology, the food industry increasingly demands higher production quality and efficiency. Food image classification plays a vital role in enabling automated quality control on production lines, supporting food safety supervision, and promoting intelligent agricultural production. However, this task faces challenges due to the large number of parameters and high computational complexity of Vision Transformer models. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight food image classification algorithm that integrates a Window Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (WMHAM) and a Spatial Attention Mechanism (SAM). The WMHAM reduces computational cost by capturing local and global contextual features through efficient window partitioning, while the SAM adaptively emphasizes key spatial regions to improve discriminative feature representation. Experiments conducted on the Food-101 and Vireo Food-172 datasets demonstrate that our model achieves accuracies of 95.24% and 94.33%, respectively, while significantly reducing parameters and FLOPs compared with baseline methods. These results confirm that the proposed approach achieves an effective balance between computational efficiency and classification performance, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

<title>OSDA: A Framework for Open-Set Discovery and Automatic Interpretation of Land-cover in Remote Sensing Imagery</title>

Abstract: Open-set land-cover analysis in remote sensing requires the ability to achieve fine-grained spatial localization and semantically open categorization. This involves not only detecting and segmenting novel objects without categorical supervision but also assigning them interpretable semantic labels through multimodal reasoning. In this study, we introduce OSDA, an integrated three-stage framework for annotation-free open-set land-cover discovery, segmentation, and description. The pipeline consists of: (1) precise discovery and mask extraction with a promptable fine-tuned segmentation model (SAM), (2) semantic attribution and contextual description via a two-phase fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM), and (3) LLM-as-judge and manual scoring of the MLLMs evaluation. By combining pixel-level accuracy with high-level semantic understanding, OSDA addresses key challenges in open-world remote sensing interpretation. Designed to be architecture-agnostic and label-free, the framework supports robust evaluation across diverse satellite imagery without requiring manual annotation. Our work provides a scalable and interpretable solution for dynamic land-cover monitoring, showing strong potential for automated cartographic updating and large-scale earth observation analysis.

Abstract: Automated plant identification has improved considerably thanks to recent advances in deep learning and the availability of training data with more and more field photos. However, this profusion of data concerns only a few tens of thousands of species, mainly located in North America and Western Europe, much less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity such as tropical countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists have systematically collected, catalogued and stored plant specimens in herbaria, especially in tropical regions, and recent efforts by the biodiversity informatics community have made it possible to put millions of digitised records online. The LifeCLEF 2021 plant identification challenge (or "PlantCLEF 2021") was designed to assess the extent to which automated identification of flora in data-poor regions can be improved by using herbarium collections. It is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species mainly focused on the Guiana Shield of South America, a region known to have one of the highest plant diversities in the world. The challenge was evaluated as a cross-domain classification task where the training set consisted of several hundred thousand herbarium sheets and a few thousand photos to allow learning a correspondence between the two domains. In addition to the usual metadata (location, date, author, taxonomy), the training data also includes the values of 5 morphological and functional traits for each species. The test set consisted exclusively of photos taken in the field. This article presents the resources and evaluations of the assessment carried out, summarises the approaches and systems used by the participating research groups and provides an analysis of the main results.

Abstract: Fusing cross-category objects to a single coherent object has gained increasing attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation due to its broad applications in virtual reality, digital media, film, and gaming. However, existing methods often produce biased, visually chaotic, or semantically inconsistent results due to overlapping artifacts and poor integration. Moreover, progress in this field has been limited by the absence of a comprehensive benchmark dataset. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{Adaptive Group Swapping (AGSwap)}, a simple yet highly effective approach comprising two key components: (1) Group-wise Embedding Swapping, which fuses semantic attributes from different concepts through feature manipulation, and (2) Adaptive Group Updating, a dynamic optimization mechanism guided by a balance evaluation score to ensure coherent synthesis. Additionally, we introduce \textbf{Cross-category Object Fusion (COF)}, a large-scale, hierarchically structured dataset built upon ImageNet-1K and WordNet. COF includes 95 superclasses, each with 10 subclasses, enabling 451,250 unique fusion pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSwap outperforms state-of-the-art compositional T2I methods, including GPT-Image-1 using simple and complex prompts.

Abstract: Automated identification of plants has improved considerably thanks to the recent progress in deep learning and the availability of training data. However, this profusion of data only concerns a few tens of thousands of species, while the planet has nearly 369K. The LifeCLEF 2019 Plant Identification challenge (or "PlantCLEF 2019") was designed to evaluate automated identification on the flora of data deficient regions. It is based on a dataset of 10K species mainly focused on the Guiana shield and the Northern Amazon rainforest, an area known to have one of the greatest diversity of plants and animals in the world. As in the previous edition, a comparison of the performance of the systems evaluated with the best tropical flora experts was carried out. This paper presents the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

<title>RSVG-ZeroOV: Exploring a Training-Free Framework for Zero-Shot Open-Vocabulary Visual Grounding in Remote Sensing Images</title>

Abstract: Remote sensing visual grounding (RSVG) aims to localize objects in remote sensing images based on free-form natural language expressions. Existing approaches are typically constrained to closed-set vocabularies, limiting their applicability in open-world scenarios. While recent attempts to leverage generic foundation models for open-vocabulary RSVG, they overly rely on expensive high-quality datasets and time-consuming fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{RSVG-ZeroOV}, a training-free framework that aims to explore the potential of frozen generic foundation models for zero-shot open-vocabulary RSVG. Specifically, RSVG-ZeroOV comprises three key stages: (i) Overview: We utilize a vision-language model (VLM) to obtain cross-attention\footnote[1]{In this paper, although decoder-only VLMs use self-attention over all tokens, we refer to the image-text interaction part as cross-attention to distinguish it from pure visual self-attention.}maps that capture semantic correlations between text queries and visual regions. (ii) Focus: By leveraging the fine-grained modeling priors of a diffusion model (DM), we fill in gaps in structural and shape information of objects, which are often overlooked by VLM. (iii) Evolve: A simple yet effective attention evolution module is introduced to suppress irrelevant activations, yielding purified segmentation masks over the referred objects. Without cumbersome task-specific training, RSVG-ZeroOV offers an efficient and scalable solution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot methods.

<title>What Makes You Unique? Attribute Prompt Composition for Object Re-Identification</title>

Abstract: Object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to recognize individuals across non-overlapping camera views. While recent advances have achieved remarkable progress, most existing models are constrained to either single-domain or cross-domain scenarios, limiting their real-world applicability. Single-domain models tend to overfit to domain-specific features, whereas cross-domain models often rely on diverse normalization strategies that may inadvertently suppress identity-specific discriminative cues. To address these limitations, we propose an Attribute Prompt Composition (APC) framework, which exploits textual semantics to jointly enhance discrimination and generalization. Specifically, we design an Attribute Prompt Generator (APG) consisting of a Semantic Attribute Dictionary (SAD) and a Prompt Composition Module (PCM). SAD is an over-complete attribute dictionary to provide rich semantic descriptions, while PCM adaptively composes relevant attributes from SAD to generate discriminative attribute-aware features. In addition, motivated by the strong generalization ability of Vision-Language Models (VLM), we propose a Fast-Slow Training Strategy (FSTS) to balance ReID-specific discrimination and generalizable representation learning. Specifically, FSTS adopts a Fast Update Stream (FUS) to rapidly acquire ReID-specific discriminative knowledge and a Slow Update Stream (SUS) to retain the generalizable knowledge inherited from the pre-trained VLM. Through a mutual interaction, the framework effectively focuses on ReID-relevant features while mitigating overfitting. Extensive experiments on both conventional and Domain Generalized (DG) ReID datasets demonstrate that our framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods, exhibiting superior performances in terms of both discrimination and generalization. The source code is available at https://github.com/AWangYQ/APC.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models are threatened by targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks due to massive training image-caption pairs crawled from the Internet. Previous defense methods correct poisoned image-caption pairs by matching a new caption for each image. However, the matching process relies solely on the global representations of images and captions, overlooking fine-grained features of visual and textual features. It may introduce incorrect image-caption pairs and harm the CLIP pre-training. To address their limitations, we propose an Optimal Transport-based framework to reconstruct image-caption pairs, named OTCCLIP. We propose a new optimal transport-based distance measure between fine-grained visual and textual feature sets and re-assign new captions based on the proposed optimal transport distance. Additionally, to further reduce the negative impact of mismatched pairs, we encourage the inter- and intra-modality fine-grained alignment by employing optimal transport-based objective functions. Our experiments demonstrate that OTCCLIP can successfully decrease the attack success rates of poisoning attacks. Also, compared to previous methods, OTCCLIP significantly improves CLIP's zero-shot and linear probing performance trained on poisoned datasets.

Abstract: Current visual foundation models (VFMs) face a fundamental limitation in transferring knowledge from vision language models (VLMs), while VLMs excel at modeling cross-modal interactions through unified representation spaces, existing VFMs predominantly adopt result-oriented paradigms that neglect the underlying interaction processes. This representational discrepancy hinders effective knowledge transfer and limits generalization across diverse vision tasks. We propose Learning from Interactions (LFI), a cognitive-inspired framework that addresses this gap by explicitly modeling visual understanding as an interactive process. Our key insight is that capturing the dynamic interaction patterns encoded in pre-trained VLMs enables more faithful and efficient knowledge transfer to VFMs. The approach centers on two technical innovations, Interaction Queries, which maintain persistent relational structures across network layers, and interaction-based supervision, derived from the cross-modal attention mechanisms of VLMs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks, achieving 3.3 and 1.6mAP/2.4AP absolute gains on TinyImageNet classification and COCO detection/segmentation respectively, with minimal parameter overhead and faster convergence. The framework particularly excels in cross-domain settings, delivering 2.4 and 9.3 zero-shot improvements on PACS and VLCS. Human evaluations further confirm its cognitive alignment, outperforming result-oriented methods by 2.7 times in semantic consistency metrics.

Abstract: RGB-thermal salient object detection (RGB-T SOD) aims to identify prominent objects by integrating complementary information from RGB and thermal modalities. However, learning the precise boundaries and complete objects remains challenging due to the intrinsic insufficient feature fusion and the extrinsic limitations of data scarcity. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid prompt-driven segment anything model (HyPSAM), which leverages the zero-shot generalization capabilities of the segment anything model (SAM) for RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we first propose a dynamic fusion network (DFNet) that generates high-quality initial saliency maps as visual prompts. DFNet employs dynamic convolution and multi-branch decoding to facilitate adaptive cross-modality interaction, overcoming the limitations of fixed-parameter kernels and enhancing multi-modal feature representation. Moreover, we propose a plug-and-play refinement network (P2RNet), which serves as a general optimization strategy to guide SAM in refining saliency maps by using hybrid prompts. The text prompt ensures reliable modality input, while the mask and box prompts enable precise salient object localization. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, HyPSAM has remarkable versatility, seamlessly integrating with different RGB-T SOD methods to achieve significant performance gains, thereby highlighting the potential of prompt engineering in this field. The code and results of our method are available at: https://github.com/milotic233/HyPSAM.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception is central to autonomous driving and robotics, yet raw point clouds remain highly vulnerable to noise, occlusion, and adversarial corruptions. Autoencoders offer a natural framework for denoising and reconstruction, but their performance degrades under challenging real-world conditions. In this work, we propose TriFusion-AE, a multimodal cross-attention autoencoder that integrates textual priors, monocular depth maps from multi-view images, and LiDAR point clouds to improve robustness. By aligning semantic cues from text, geometric (depth) features from images, and spatial structure from LiDAR, TriFusion-AE learns representations that are resilient to stochastic noise and adversarial perturbations. Interestingly, while showing limited gains under mild perturbations, our model achieves significantly more robust reconstruction under strong adversarial attacks and heavy noise, where CNN-based autoencoders collapse. We evaluate on the nuScenes-mini dataset to reflect realistic low-data deployment scenarios. Our multimodal fusion framework is designed to be model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with any CNN-based point cloud autoencoder for joint representation learning.

Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however, assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable success in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, reconstructing 3D scenes from sparse viewpoints remains highly challenging due to insufficient visual information, which results in noticeable artifacts persisting across the 3D representation. To address this limitation, recent methods have resorted to generative priors to remove artifacts and complete missing content in under-constrained areas. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches struggle to ensure multi-view consistency, resulting in blurred structures and implausible details. In this work, we propose FixingGS, a training-free method that fully exploits the capabilities of the existing diffusion model for sparse-view 3DGS reconstruction enhancement. At the core of FixingGS is our distillation approach, which delivers more accurate and cross-view coherent diffusion priors, thereby enabling effective artifact removal and inpainting. In addition, we propose an adaptive progressive enhancement scheme that further refines reconstructions in under-constrained regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FixingGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods with superior visual quality and reconstruction performance. Our code will be released publicly.

<title>Bi-VLM: Pushing Ultra-Low Precision Post-Training Quantization Boundaries in Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: We address the critical gap between the computational demands of vision-language models and the possible ultra-low-bit weight precision (bitwidth $\leq2$ bits) we can use for higher efficiency. Our work is motivated by the substantial computational cost and memory requirements of VLMs, which restrict their applicability in hardware-constrained environments. We propose Bi-VLM, which separates model weights non-uniformly based on the Gaussian quantiles. Our formulation groups the model weights into outlier (salient) and multiple inlier (unsalient) subsets, ensuring that each subset contains a proportion of weights corresponding to its quantile in the distribution. We propose a saliency-aware hybrid quantization algorithm and use it to quantize weights by imposing different constraints on the scaler and binary matrices based on the saliency metric and compression objective. We have evaluated our approach on different VLMs. For the language model part of the VLM, our Bi-VLM outperforms the SOTA by 3%-47% on the visual question answering task in terms of four different benchmarks and three different models. For the overall VLM, our Bi-VLM outperforms the SOTA by 4%-45%. We also perform token pruning on the quantized models and observe that there is redundancy of image tokens 90% - 99% in the quantized models. This helps us to further prune the visual tokens to improve efficiency.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for medical image representation learning, particularly in settings with limited labeled data. However, existing SSL methods often rely on complex architectures, anatomy-specific priors, or heavily tuned augmentations, which limit their scalability and generalizability. More critically, these models are prone to shortcut learning, especially in modalities like chest X-rays, where anatomical similarity is high and pathology is subtle. In this work, we introduce DiSSECT -- Discrete Self-Supervision for Efficient Clinical Transferable Representations, a framework that integrates multi-scale vector quantization into the SSL pipeline to impose a discrete representational bottleneck. This constrains the model to learn repeatable, structure-aware features while suppressing view-specific or low-utility patterns, improving representation transfer across tasks and domains. DiSSECT achieves strong performance on both classification and segmentation tasks, requiring minimal or no fine-tuning, and shows particularly high label efficiency in low-label regimes. We validate DiSSECT across multiple public medical imaging datasets, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Deer-vehicle collisions represent a critical safety challenge in the United States, causing nearly 2.1 million incidents annually and resulting in approximately 440 fatalities, 59,000 injuries, and 10 billion USD in economic damages. These collisions also contribute significantly to declining deer populations. This paper presents a real-time detection and driver warning system that integrates thermal imaging, deep learning, and vehicle-to-everything communication to help mitigate deer-vehicle collisions. Our system was trained and validated on a custom dataset of over 12,000 thermal deer images collected in Mars Hill, North Carolina. Experimental evaluation demonstrates exceptional performance with 98.84 percent mean average precision, 95.44 percent precision, and 95.96 percent recall. The system was field tested during a follow-up visit to Mars Hill and readily sensed deer providing the driver with advanced warning. Field testing validates robust operation across diverse weather conditions, with thermal imaging maintaining between 88 and 92 percent detection accuracy in challenging scenarios where conventional visible light based cameras achieve less than 60 percent effectiveness. When a high probability threshold is reached sensor data sharing messages are broadcast to surrounding vehicles and roadside units via cellular vehicle to everything (CV2X) communication devices. Overall, our system achieves end to end latency consistently under 100 milliseconds from detection to driver alert. This research establishes a viable technological pathway for reducing deer-vehicle collisions through thermal imaging and connected vehicles.

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated surgical data poses a significant challenge for developing deep learning systems in computer-assisted interventions. While diffusion models can synthesize realistic images, they often suffer from data memorization, resulting in inconsistent or non-diverse samples that may fail to improve, or even harm, downstream performance. We introduce \emph{Surgical Application-Aligned Diffusion} (SAADi), a new framework that aligns diffusion models with samples preferred by downstream models. Our method constructs pairs of \emph{preferred} and \emph{non-preferred} synthetic images and employs lightweight fine-tuning of diffusion models to align the image generation process with downstream objectives explicitly. Experiments on three surgical datasets demonstrate consistent gains of $7$--$9\%$ in classification and $2$--$10\%$ in segmentation tasks, with the considerable improvements observed for underrepresented classes. Iterative refinement of synthetic samples further boosts performance by $4$--$10\%$. Unlike baseline approaches, our method overcomes sample degradation and establishes task-aware alignment as a key principle for mitigating data scarcity and advancing surgical vision applications.

Abstract: Achieving high image quality for temporal frames in dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) is challenging due to the limited statistic especially for the short frames. Recent studies have shown that deep learning (DL) is useful in a wide range of medical image denoising tasks. In this paper, we propose a model-based neural network for dynamic PET image denoising. The inter-frame spatial correlation and intra-frame structural consistency in dynamic PET are used to establish the kernel space-based multidimensional sparse (KMDS) model. We then substitute the inherent forms of the parameter estimation with neural networks to enable adaptive parameters optimization, forming the end-to-end neural KMDS-Net. Extensive experimental results from simulated and real data demonstrate that the neural KMDS-Net exhibits strong denoising performance for dynamic PET, outperforming previous baseline methods. The proposed method may be used to effectively achieve high temporal and spatial resolution for dynamic PET. Our source code is available at https://github.com/Kuangxd/Neural-KMDS-Net/tree/main.

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has become a critical paradigm in modern surgery, promoting patient recovery and reducing the burden on surgeons through minimally invasive approaches. To fully realize its potential, however, a precise understanding of the visual data generated during surgical procedures is essential. Previous studies have predominantly focused on single-task approaches, but real surgical scenes involve complex temporal dynamics and diverse instrument interactions that limit comprehensive understanding. Moreover, the effective application of multi-task learning (MTL) requires sufficient pixel-level segmentation data, which are difficult to obtain due to the high cost and expertise required for annotation. In particular, long-term annotations such as phases and steps are available for every frame, whereas short-term annotations such as surgical instrument segmentation and action detection are provided only for key frames, resulting in a significant temporal-spatial imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines optical flow-based segmentation label interpolation with multi-task learning. optical flow estimated from annotated key frames is used to propagate labels to adjacent unlabeled frames, thereby enriching sparse spatial supervision and balancing temporal and spatial information for training. This integration improves both the accuracy and efficiency of surgical scene understanding and, in turn, enhances the utility of RAS.

<title>Hyper-Bagel: A Unified Acceleration Framework for Multimodal Understanding and Generation</title>

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently attracted considerable attention for their remarkable abilities in jointly understanding and generating diverse content. However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding impose significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose Hyper-Bagel, a unified acceleration framework designed to simultaneously speed up both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Our approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, employing speculative decoding for next-token prediction and a multi-stage distillation process for diffusion denoising. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, achieving over a 2x speedup in multimodal understanding. For generative tasks, our resulting lossless 6-NFE model yields a 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation and a 22x speedup in image editing, all while preserving the high-quality output of the original model. We further develop a highly efficient 1-NFE model that enables near real-time interactive editing and generation. By combining advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning, this model achieves ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness, making complex multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous.

<title>Benchmarking Vision-Language and Multimodal Large Language Models in Zero-shot and Few-shot Scenarios: A study on Christian Iconography</title>

Abstract: This study evaluates the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) in the task of single-label classification of Christian Iconography. The goal was to assess whether general-purpose VLMs (CLIP and SigLIP) and LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5, can interpret the Iconography, typically addressed by supervised classifiers, and evaluate their performance. Two research questions guided the analysis: (RQ1) How do multimodal LLMs perform on image classification of Christian saints? And (RQ2), how does performance vary when enriching input with contextual information or few-shot exemplars? We conducted a benchmarking study using three datasets supporting Iconclass natively: ArtDL, ICONCLASS, and Wikidata, filtered to include the top 10 most frequent classes. Models were tested under three conditions: (1) classification using class labels, (2) classification with Iconclass descriptions, and (3) few-shot learning with five exemplars. Results were compared against ResNet50 baselines fine-tuned on the same datasets. The findings show that Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-4o outperformed the ResNet50 baselines. Accuracy dropped significantly on the Wikidata dataset, where Siglip reached the highest accuracy score, suggesting model sensitivity to image size and metadata alignment. Enriching prompts with class descriptions generally improved zero-shot performance, while few-shot learning produced lower results, with only occasional and minimal increments in accuracy. We conclude that general-purpose multimodal LLMs are capable of classification in visually complex cultural heritage domains. These results support the application of LLMs as metadata curation tools in digital humanities workflows, suggesting future research on prompt optimization and the expansion of the study to other classification strategies and models.

<title>ViG-LRGC: Vision Graph Neural Networks with Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction</title>

Abstract: Image Representation Learning is an important problem in Computer Vision. Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers. Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark dataset.

<title>Failure Makes the Agent Stronger: Enhancing Accuracy through Structured Reflection for Reliable Tool Interactions</title>

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are usually trained with supervised imitation or coarse-grained reinforcement learning that optimizes single tool calls. Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts or one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning error diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a failure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured reflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit, controllable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise reflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and then proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine DAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing the stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce Tool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result consistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call, reflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits. Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn tool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These results indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly improves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for agents to learn from failure.

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), yet existing approaches often rely on heuristic or manually crafted prompts, limiting scalability and generalization. In this paper, we propose Point Prompt Defender, an adversarial reinforcement learning framework that adopts an attack-for-defense paradigm to automatically optimize point prompts. We construct a task-agnostic point prompt environment by representing image patches as nodes in a dual-space graph, where edges encode both physical and semantic distances. Within this environment, an attacker agent learns to activate a subset of prompts that maximally degrade SAM's segmentation performance, while a defender agent learns to suppress these disruptive prompts and restore accuracy. Both agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks with a reward signal based on segmentation quality variation. During inference, only the defender is deployed to refine arbitrary coarse prompt sets, enabling enhanced SAM segmentation performance across diverse tasks without retraining. Extensive experiments show that Point Prompt Defender effectively improves SAM's robustness and generalization, establishing a flexible, interpretable, and plug-and-play framework for prompt-based segmentation.

Abstract: We present the first release of SmartWilds, a multimodal wildlife monitoring dataset. SmartWilds is a synchronized collection of drone imagery, camera trap photographs and videos, and bioacoustic recordings collected during summer 2025 at The Wilds safari park in Ohio. This dataset supports multimodal AI research for comprehensive environmental monitoring, addressing critical needs in endangered species research, conservation ecology, and habitat management. Our pilot deployment captured four days of synchronized monitoring across three modalities in a 220-acre pasture containing Pere David's deer, Sichuan takin, Przewalski's horses, as well as species native to Ohio, including bald eagles, white-tailed deer, and coyotes. We provide a comparative analysis of sensor modality performance, demonstrating complementary strengths for landuse patterns, species detection, behavioral analysis, and habitat monitoring. This work establishes reproducible protocols for multimodal wildlife monitoring while contributing open datasets to advance conservation computer vision research. Future releases will include synchronized GPS tracking data from tagged individuals, citizen science data, and expanded temporal coverage across multiple seasons.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark designed to propel the advancement of general-purpose, large-scale 3D vision models for remote sensing imagery. While several datasets have been proposed within the realm of remote sensing, many existing collections either lack comprehensive depth information or fail to establish precise alignment between depth data and remote sensing images. To address this deficiency, we present a visual Benchmark for 3D understanding of Remotely Sensed images, dubbed RS3DBench. This dataset encompasses 54,951 pairs of remote sensing images and pixel-level aligned depth maps, accompanied by corresponding textual descriptions, spanning a broad array of geographical contexts. It serves as a tool for training and assessing 3D visual perception models within remote sensing image spatial understanding tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a remotely sensed depth estimation model derived from stable diffusion, harnessing its multimodal fusion capabilities, thereby delivering state-of-the-art performance on our dataset. Our endeavor seeks to make a profound contribution to the evolution of 3D visual perception models and the advancement of geographic artificial intelligence within the remote sensing domain.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-free deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting method via event camera, dubbed DeblurSplat. We address the motion-deblurring problem in two ways. First, we leverage the pretrained capability of the dense stereo module (DUSt3R) to directly obtain accurate initial point clouds from blurred images. Without calculating camera poses as an intermediate result, we avoid the cumulative errors transfer from inaccurate camera poses to the initial point clouds' positions. Second, we introduce the event stream into the deblur pipeline for its high sensitivity to dynamic change. By decoding the latent sharp images from the event stream and blurred images, we can provide a fine-grained supervision signal for scene reconstruction optimization. Extensive experiments across a range of scenes demonstrate that DeblurSplat not only excels in generating high-fidelity novel views but also achieves significant rendering efficiency compared to the SOTAs in deblur 3D-GS.

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns arise from spectral aliasing between display pixel lattices and camera sensor grids, manifesting as anisotropic, multi-scale artifacts that pose significant challenges for digital image demoir\'eing. We propose Moir\'eNet, a convolutional neural U-Net-based framework that synergistically integrates frequency and spatial domain features for effective artifact removal. Moir\'eNet introduces two key components: a Directional Frequency-Spatial Encoder (DFSE) that discerns moir\'e orientation via directional difference convolution, and a Frequency-Spatial Adaptive Selector (FSAS) that enables precise, feature-adaptive suppression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Moir\'eNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on public and actively used datasets while being highly parameter-efficient. With only 5.513M parameters, representing a 48% reduction compared to ESDNet-L, Moir\'eNet combines superior restoration quality with parameter efficiency, making it well-suited for resource-constrained applications including smartphone photography, industrial imaging, and augmented reality.

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) plays a critical role in multimodal machine learning by effectively integrating audio and visual cues to precisely segment objects or regions within visual scenes. Recent AVS methods have demonstrated significant improvements. However, they overlook the inherent frequency-domain contradictions between audio and visual modalities--the pervasively interfering noise in audio high-frequency signals vs. the structurally rich details in visual high-frequency signals. Ignoring these differences can result in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we rethink the AVS task from a deeper perspective by reformulating AVS task as a frequency-domain decomposition and recomposition problem. To this end, we introduce a novel Frequency-Aware Audio-Visual Segmentation (FAVS) framework consisting of two key modules: Frequency-Domain Enhanced Decomposer (FDED) module and Synergistic Cross-Modal Consistency (SCMC) module. FDED module employs a residual-based iterative frequency decomposition to discriminate modality-specific semantics and structural features, and SCMC module leverages a mixture-of-experts architecture to reinforce semantic consistency and modality-specific feature preservation through dynamic expert routing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our FAVS framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets, and abundant qualitative visualizations further verify the effectiveness of the proposed FDED and SCMC modules. The code will be released as open source upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Deep learning has become the de facto standard and dominant paradigm in image analysis tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, this approach often results in "black-box" models, whose decision-making processes are difficult to interpret, raising concerns about reliability in critical applications. To address this challenge and provide human a method to understand how AI model process and make decision, the field of xAI has emerged. This paper surveys four representative approaches in xAI for visual perception tasks: (i) Saliency Maps, (ii) Concept Bottleneck Models (CBM), (iii) Prototype-based methods, and (iv) Hybrid approaches. We analyze their underlying mechanisms, strengths and limitations, as well as evaluation metrics, thereby providing a comprehensive overview to guide future research and applications.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to revolutionize transportation by improving efficiency and safety. Their success relies on 3D vision systems that effectively sense the environment and detect traffic agents. Among sensors AVs use to create a comprehensive view of surroundings, LiDAR provides high-resolution depth data enabling accurate object detection, safe navigation, and collision avoidance. However, collecting real-world LiDAR data is time-consuming and often affected by noise and sparsity due to adverse weather or sensor limitations. This work applies a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), enhanced with novel noise scheduling and time-step embedding techniques to generate high-quality synthetic data for augmentation, thereby improving performance across a range of computer vision tasks, particularly in AV perception. These modifications impact the denoising process and the model's temporal awareness, allowing it to produce more realistic point clouds based on the projection. The proposed method was extensively evaluated under various configurations using the IAMCV and KITTI-360 datasets, with four performance metrics compared against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results demonstrate the model's superior performance over most existing baselines and its effectiveness in mitigating the effects of noisy and sparse LiDAR data, producing diverse point clouds with rich spatial relationships and structural detail.

<title>Advancing Metallic Surface Defect Detection via Anomaly-Guided Pretraining on a Large Industrial Dataset</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18919</link>

Abstract: The pretraining-finetuning paradigm is a crucial strategy in metallic surface defect detection for mitigating the challenges posed by data scarcity. However, its implementation presents a critical dilemma. Pretraining on natural image datasets such as ImageNet, faces a significant domain gap. Meanwhile, naive self-supervised pretraining on in-domain industrial data is often ineffective due to the inability of existing learning objectives to distinguish subtle defect patterns from complex background noise and textures. To resolve this, we introduce Anomaly-Guided Self-Supervised Pretraining (AGSSP), a novel paradigm that explicitly guides representation learning through anomaly priors. AGSSP employs a two-stage framework: (1) it first pretrains the model's backbone by distilling knowledge from anomaly maps, encouraging the network to capture defect-salient features; (2) it then pretrains the detector using pseudo-defect boxes derived from these maps, aligning it with localization tasks. To enable this, we develop a knowledge-enhanced method to generate high-quality anomaly maps and collect a large-scale industrial dataset of 120,000 images. Additionally, we present two small-scale, pixel-level labeled metallic surface defect datasets for validation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSSP consistently enhances performance across various settings, achieving up to a 10\% improvement in mAP@0.5 and 11.4\% in mAP@0.5:0.95 compared to ImageNet-based models. All code, pretrained models, and datasets are publicly available at https://clovermini.github.io/AGSSP-Dev/.

<title>Audio-Driven Universal Gaussian Head Avatars</title>

arXiv:2509.18924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the first method for audio-driven universal photorealistic avatar synthesis, combining a person-agnostic speech model with our novel Universal Head Avatar Prior (UHAP). UHAP is trained on cross-identity multi-view videos. In particular, our UHAP is supervised with neutral scan data, enabling it to capture the identity-specific details at high fidelity. In contrast to previous approaches, which predominantly map audio features to geometric deformations only while ignoring audio-dependent appearance variations, our universal speech model directly maps raw audio inputs into the UHAP latent expression space. This expression space inherently encodes, both, geometric and appearance variations. For efficient personalization to new subjects, we employ a monocular encoder, which enables lightweight regression of dynamic expression variations across video frames. By accounting for these expression-dependent changes, it enables the subsequent model fine-tuning stage to focus exclusively on capturing the subject's global appearance and geometry. Decoding these audio-driven expression codes via UHAP generates highly realistic avatars with precise lip synchronization and nuanced expressive details, such as eyebrow movement, gaze shifts, and realistic mouth interior appearance as well as motion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method is not only the first generalizable audio-driven avatar model that can account for detailed appearance modeling and rendering, but it also outperforms competing (geometry-only) methods across metrics measuring lip-sync accuracy, quantitative image quality, and perceptual realism.

<title>SynapFlow: A Modular Framework Towards Large-Scale Analysis of Dendritic Spines</title>

Abstract: Dendritic spines are key structural components of excitatory synapses in the brain. Given the size of dendritic spines provides a proxy for synaptic efficacy, their detection and tracking across time is important for studies of the neural basis of learning and memory. Despite their relevance, large-scale analyses of the structural dynamics of dendritic spines in 3D+time microscopy data remain challenging and labor-intense. Here, we present a modular machine learning-based pipeline designed to automate the detection, time-tracking, and feature extraction of dendritic spines in volumes chronically recorded with two-photon microscopy. Our approach tackles the challenges posed by biological data by combining a transformer-based detection module, a depth-tracking component that integrates spatial features, a time-tracking module to associate 3D spines across time by leveraging spatial consistency, and a feature extraction unit that quantifies biologically relevant spine properties. We validate our method on open-source labeled spine data, and on two complementary annotated datasets that we publish alongside this work: one for detection and depth-tracking, and one for time-tracking, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first data of this kind. To encourage future research, we release our data, code, and pre-trained weights at https://github.com/pamelaosuna/SynapFlow, establishing a baseline for scalable, end-to-end analysis of dendritic spine dynamics.

Abstract: While deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced classification performance, its typical reliance on extensive annotated datasets presents a major obstacle in many practical scenarios where such data is scarce. Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier, allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.

<title>Seeing Through Reflections: Advancing 3D Scene Reconstruction in Mirror-Containing Environments with Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: Mirror-containing environments pose unique challenges for 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis (NVS), as reflective surfaces introduce view-dependent distortions and inconsistencies. While cutting-edge methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excel in typical scenes, their performance deteriorates in the presence of mirrors. Existing solutions mainly focus on handling mirror surfaces through symmetry mapping but often overlook the rich information carried by mirror reflections. These reflections offer complementary perspectives that can fill in absent details and significantly enhance reconstruction quality. To advance 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich environments, we present MirrorScene3D, a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse indoor scenes, 1256 high-quality images, and annotated mirror masks, providing a benchmark for evaluating reconstruction methods in reflective settings. Building on this, we propose ReflectiveGS, an extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes mirror reflections as complementary viewpoints rather than simple symmetry artifacts, enhancing scene geometry and recovering absent details. Experiments on MirrorScene3D show that ReflectiveGaussian outperforms existing methods in SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and training speed, setting a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich environments.

Abstract: Cholecystectomy is one of the most frequently performed procedures in gastrointestinal surgery, and the laparoscopic approach is the gold standard for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis and acute cholecystitis. In addition to the advantages of a significantly faster recovery and better cosmetic results, the laparoscopic approach bears a higher risk of bile duct injury, which has a significant impact on quality of life and survival. To avoid bile duct injury, it is essential to improve the intraoperative visualization of the bile duct. This work aims to address this problem by leveraging a deep-learning approach for the localization of the biliary tract from white-light images acquired during the surgical procedures. To this end, the construction and annotation of an image database to train the Yolo detection algorithm has been employed. Besides classical data augmentation techniques, the paper proposes Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for the generation of a synthetic portion of the training dataset. Experimental results have been discussed along with ethical considerations.

Abstract: Domain adaptive segmentation (DAS) of numerous organelle instances from large-scale electron microscopy (EM) is a promising way to enable annotation-efficient learning. Inspired by SAM, we propose a promptable multitask framework, namely Prompt-DAS, which is flexible enough to utilize any number of point prompts during the adaptation training stage and testing stage. Thus, with varying prompt configurations, Prompt-DAS can perform unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA), as well as interactive segmentation during testing. Unlike the foundation model SAM, which necessitates a prompt for each individual object instance, Prompt-DAS is only trained on a small dataset and can utilize full points on all instances, sparse points on partial instances, or even no points at all, facilitated by the incorporation of an auxiliary center-point detection task. Moreover, a novel prompt-guided contrastive learning is proposed to enhance discriminative feature learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over existing UDA, WDA, and SAM-based approaches.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced video understanding capabilities, opening new possibilities for practical applications. Yet current video benchmarks focus largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs' geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.

Abstract: Chain of thought reasoning has demonstrated remarkable success in large language models, yet its adaptation to vision-language reasoning remains an open challenge with unclear best practices. Existing attempts typically employ reasoning chains at a coarse-grained level, which struggles to perform fine-grained structured reasoning and, more importantly, are difficult to evaluate the reward and quality of intermediate reasoning. In this work, we delve into chain of step reasoning for vision-language models, enabling assessing reasoning step quality accurately and leading to effective reinforcement learning and inference-time scaling with fine-grained rewards. We present a simple, effective, and fully transparent framework, including the step-level reasoning data, process reward model (PRM), and reinforcement learning training. With the proposed approaches, our models set strong baselines with consistent improvements on challenging vision-language benchmarks. More importantly, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis and ablation study, unveiling the impact of each component and several intriguing properties of inference-time scaling. We believe this paper serves as a baseline for vision-language models and offers insights into more complex multimodal reasoning. Our dataset, PRM, and code will be available at https://github.com/baaivision/CoS.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation approach for food images which takes advantage of the zero-shot capabilities and promptability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) along with the attention mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, we use class activation maps (CAMs) from ViTs to generate prompts for SAM, resulting in masks suitable for food image segmentation. The ViT model, a Swin Transformer, is trained exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of 2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food and nutrition tracking applications.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cardiac anatomy in echocardiography is essential for cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment. Yet echocardiography is prone to deformation and speckle noise, causing frame-to-frame segmentation jitter. Even with high accuracy in single-frame segmentation, temporal instability can weaken functional estimates and impair clinical interpretability. To address these issues, we propose DyL-UNet, a dynamic learning-based temporal consistency U-Net segmentation architecture designed to achieve temporally stable and precise echocardiographic segmentation. The framework constructs an Echo-Dynamics Graph (EDG) through dynamic learning to extract dynamic information from videos. DyL-UNet incorporates multiple Swin-Transformer-based encoder-decoder branches for processing single-frame images. It further introduces Cardiac Phase-Dynamics Attention (CPDA) at the skip connections, which uses EDG-encoded dynamic features and cardiac-phase cues to enforce temporal consistency during segmentation. Extensive experiments on the CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets demonstrate that DyL-UNet maintains segmentation accuracy comparable to existing methods while achieving superior temporal consistency, providing a reliable solution for automated clinical echocardiography.

Abstract: This paper presents ColorBlindnessEval, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in visually adversarial scenarios inspired by the Ishihara color blindness test. Our dataset comprises 500 Ishihara-like images featuring numbers from 0 to 99 with varying color combinations, challenging VLMs to accurately recognize numerical information embedded in complex visual patterns. We assess 9 VLMs using Yes/No and open-ended prompts and compare their performance with human participants. Our experiments reveal limitations in the models' ability to interpret numbers in adversarial contexts, highlighting prevalent hallucination issues. These findings underscore the need to improve the robustness of VLMs in complex visual environments. ColorBlindnessEval serves as a valuable tool for benchmarking and improving the reliability of VLMs in real-world applications where accuracy is critical.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a powerful representation for image-based object reconstruction, yet its performance drops sharply in sparse-view settings. Prior works address this limitation by employing diffusion models to repair corrupted renders, subsequently using them as pseudo ground truths for later optimization. While effective, such approaches incur heavy computation from the diffusion fine-tuning and repair steps. We present WaveletGaussian, a framework for more efficient sparse-view 3D Gaussian object reconstruction. Our key idea is to shift diffusion into the wavelet domain: diffusion is applied only to the low-resolution LL subband, while high-frequency subbands are refined with a lightweight network. We further propose an efficient online random masking strategy to curate training pairs for diffusion fine-tuning, replacing the commonly used, but inefficient, leave-one-out strategy. Experiments across two benchmark datasets, Mip-NeRF 360 and OmniObject3D, show WaveletGaussian achieves competitive rendering quality while substantially reducing training time.

Abstract: Sa2VA is a recent model for language-guided dense grounding in images and video that achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple segmentation benchmarks and that has become widely popular. However, we found that Sa2VA does not perform according to its full potential for referring video object segmentation tasks. We identify inconsistencies between training and inference procedures as the key factor holding it back. To mitigate this issue, we propose an improved version of Sa2VA, Sa2VA-i, that rectifies these issues and improves the results. In fact, Sa2VA-i sets a new state of the art for multiple video benchmarks and achieves improvements of up to +11.6 J&amp;F on MeViS, +1.4 on Ref-YT-VOS, +3.3 on Ref-DAVIS and +4.1 on ReVOS using the same Sa2VA checkpoints. With our fixes, the Sa2VA-i-1B model even performs on par with the original Sa2VA-26B model on the MeViS benchmark. We hope that this work will show the importance of seemingly trivial implementation details and that it will provide valuable insights for the referring video segmentation field. We provide the code and updated models at https://github.com/kumuji/sa2va-i

<title>Zero-Shot Multi-Spectral Learning: Reimagining a Generalist Multimodal Gemini 2.5 Model for Remote Sensing Applications</title>

Abstract: Multi-spectral imagery plays a crucial role in diverse Remote Sensing applications including land-use classification, environmental monitoring and urban planning. These images are widely adopted because their additional spectral bands correlate strongly with physical materials on the ground, such as ice, water, and vegetation. This allows for more accurate identification, and their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat, only adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is predominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for multi-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore, although providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs cannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are capable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand specialized multi-spectral signals.
  To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new multi-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist multimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the multimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to inputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions into the model. We exemplify this idea with the Gemini2.5 model and observe strong Zero-Shot performance gains of the approach on popular Remote Sensing benchmarks for land cover and land use classification and demonstrate the easy adaptability of Gemini2.5 to new inputs. These results highlight the potential for geospatial professionals, working with non-standard specialized inputs, to easily leverage powerful multimodal models, such as Gemini2.5, to accelerate their work, benefiting from their rich reasoning and contextual capabilities, grounded in the specialized sensor data.

Abstract: Medical imaging provides critical evidence for clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical decisions, yet most existing imaging models are narrowly focused and require multiple specialized networks, limiting their generalization. Although large-scale language and multimodal models exhibit strong reasoning and multi-task capabilities, real-world clinical applications demand precise visual grounding, multimodal integration, and chain-of-thought reasoning. We introduce Citrus-V, a multimodal medical foundation model that combines image analysis with textual reasoning. The model integrates detection, segmentation, and multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling pixel-level lesion localization, structured report generation, and physician-like diagnostic inference in a single framework. We propose a novel multimodal training approach and release a curated open-source data suite covering reasoning, detection, segmentation, and document understanding tasks. Evaluations demonstrate that Citrus-V outperforms existing open-source medical models and expert-level imaging systems across multiple benchmarks, delivering a unified pipeline from visual grounding to clinical reasoning and supporting precise lesion quantification, automated reporting, and reliable second opinions.

Abstract: Traffic safety remains a critical global concern, with timely and accurate accident detection essential for hazard reduction and rapid emergency response. Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of acci- dents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include: (1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA, explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in acci- dent identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3) Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object detection, Deep SORT for multi- object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of long-term point tracking, which requires consistent identification of points across video frames under significant appearance changes, motion, and occlusion. We target the online setting, i.e. tracking points frame-by-frame, making it suitable for real-time and streaming applications. We extend our prior model Track-On into Track-On2, a simple and efficient transformer-based model for online long-term tracking. Track-On2 improves both performance and efficiency through architectural refinements, more effective use of memory, and improved synthetic training strategies. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full-sequence access or iterative updates, our model processes frames causally and maintains temporal coherence via a memory mechanism, which is key to handling drift and occlusions without requiring future frames. At inference, we perform coarse patch-level classification followed by refinement. Beyond architecture, we systematically study synthetic training setups and their impact on memory behavior, showing how they shape temporal robustness over long sequences. Through comprehensive experiments, Track-On2 achieves state-of-the-art results across five synthetic and real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior online trackers and even strong offline methods that exploit bidirectional context. These results highlight the effectiveness of causal, memory-based architectures trained purely on synthetic data as scalable solutions for real-world point tracking.

Abstract: We introduce KAMERA: a comprehensive system for multi-camera, multi-spectral synchronization and real-time detection of seals and polar bears. Utilized in aerial surveys for ice-associated seals in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas around Alaska, KAMERA provides up to an 80% reduction in dataset processing time over previous methods. Our rigorous calibration and hardware synchronization enable using multiple spectra for object detection. All collected data are annotated with metadata so they can be easily referenced later. All imagery and animal detections from a survey are mapped onto a world plane for accurate surveyed area estimates and quick assessment of survey results. We hope KAMERA will inspire other mapping and detection efforts in the scientific community, with all software, models, and schematics fully open-sourced.

<title>NeuCODEX: Edge-Cloud Co-Inference with Spike-Driven Compression and Dynamic Early-Exit</title>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer significant potential for enabling energy-efficient intelligence at the edge. However, performing full SNN inference at the edge can be challenging due to the latency and energy constraints arising from fixed and high timestep overheads. Edge-cloud co-inference systems present a promising solution, but their deployment is often hindered by high latency and feature transmission costs. To address these issues, we introduce NeuCODEX, a neuromorphic co-inference architecture that jointly optimizes both spatial and temporal redundancy. NeuCODEX incorporates a learned spike-driven compression module to reduce data transmission and employs a dynamic early-exit mechanism to adaptively terminate inference based on output confidence. We evaluated NeuCODEX on both static images (CIFAR10 and Caltech) and neuromorphic event streams (CIFAR10-DVS and N-Caltech). To demonstrate practicality, we prototyped NeuCODEX on ResNet-18 and VGG-16 backbones in a real edge-to-cloud testbed. Our proposed system reduces data transfer by up to 2048x and edge energy consumption by over 90%, while reducing end-to-end latency by up to 3x compared to edge-only inference, all with a negligible accuracy drop of less than 2%. In doing so, NeuCODEX enables practical, high-performance SNN deployment in resource-constrained environments.

<title>RoSe: Robust Self-supervised Stereo Matching under Adverse Weather Conditions</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19165</link>

Abstract: Recent self-supervised stereo matching methods have made significant progress, but their performance significantly degrades under adverse weather conditions such as night, rain, and fog. We identify two primary weaknesses contributing to this performance degradation. First, adverse weather introduces noise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with degraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded regions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective supervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these challenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual foundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature representation under adverse weather conditions. We then introduce scene correspondence priors to construct robust supervisory signals rather than relying solely on the photometric consistency assumption. Specifically, we create synthetic stereo datasets with realistic weather degradations. These datasets feature clear and adverse image pairs that maintain the same semantic context and disparity, preserving the scene correspondence property. With this knowledge, we propose a robust self-supervised training paradigm, consisting of two key steps: robust self-supervised scene correspondence learning and adverse weather distillation. Both steps aim to align underlying scene results from clean and adverse image pairs, thus improving model disparity estimation under adverse weather effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed solution, which outperforms existing state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. Codes are available at \textcolor{blue}{https://github.com/cocowy1/RoSe-Robust-Self-supervised-Stereo-Matching-under-Adverse-Weather-Conditions}.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC), a lethal disease, begins with the growth of abnormal mucosal cell proliferation called polyps in the inner wall of the colon. When left undetected, polyps can become malignant tumors. Colonoscopy is the standard procedure for detecting polyps, as it enables direct visualization and removal of suspicious lesions. Manual detection by colonoscopy can be inconsistent and is subject to oversight. Therefore, object detection based on deep learning offers a better solution for a more accurate and real-time diagnosis during colonoscopy. In this work, we propose YOLO-LAN, a YOLO-based polyp detection pipeline, trained using M2IoU loss, versatile data augmentations and negative data to replicate real clinical situations. Our pipeline outperformed existing methods for the Kvasir-seg and BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp datasets, achieving mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9619, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8599 with YOLOv12 and mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9540, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8487 with YOLOv8 on the Kvasir-seg dataset. The significant increase is achieved in mAP$_{50:95}$ score, showing the precision of polyp detection. We show robustness based on polyp size and precise location detection, making it clinically relevant in AI-assisted colorectal screening.

Abstract: This technical report explores the MOSEv2 track of the LSVOS Challenge, which targets complex semi-supervised video object segmentation. By analysing and adapting SeC, an enhanced SAM-2 framework, we conduct a detailed study of its long-term memory and concept-aware memory, showing that long-term memory preserves temporal continuity under occlusion and reappearance, while concept-aware memory supplies semantic priors that suppress distractors; together, these traits directly benefit several MOSEv2's core challenges. Our solution achieves a JF score of 39.89% on the test set, ranking 1st in the MOSEv2 track of the LSVOS Challenge.

<title>Reading Images Like Texts: Sequential Image Understanding in Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19191</link>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a variety of real-world tasks. However, existing VLMs typically process visual information by serializing images, a method that diverges significantly from the parallel nature of human vision. Moreover, their opaque internal mechanisms hinder both deeper understanding and architectural innovation. Inspired by the dual-stream hypothesis of human vision, which distinguishes the "what" and "where" pathways, we deconstruct the visual processing in VLMs into object recognition and spatial perception for separate study. For object recognition, we convert images into text token maps and find that the model's perception of image content unfolds as a two-stage process from shallow to deep layers, beginning with attribute recognition and culminating in semantic disambiguation. For spatial perception, we theoretically derive and empirically verify the geometric structure underlying the positional representation in VLMs. Based on these findings, we introduce an instruction-agnostic token compression algorithm based on a plug-and-play visual decoder to improve decoding efficiency, and a RoPE scaling technique to enhance spatial reasoning. Through rigorous experiments, our work validates these analyses, offering a deeper understanding of VLM internals and providing clear principles for designing more capable future architectures.

<title>Vision-Free Retrieval: Rethinking Multimodal Search with Textual Scene Descriptions</title>

arXiv:2509.19203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have become the standard approach for learning discriminative vision-language representations. However, these models often exhibit shallow language understanding, manifesting bag-of-words behaviour. These limitations are reinforced by their dual-encoder design, which induces a modality gap. Additionally, the reliance on vast web-collected data corpora for training makes the process computationally expensive and introduces significant privacy concerns. To address these limitations, in this work, we challenge the necessity of vision encoders for retrieval tasks by introducing a vision-free, single-encoder retrieval pipeline. Departing from the traditional text-to-image retrieval paradigm, we migrate to a text-to-text paradigm with the assistance of VLLM-generated structured image descriptions. We demonstrate that this paradigm shift has significant advantages, including a substantial reduction of the modality gap, improved compositionality, and better performance on short and long caption queries, all attainable with only a few hours of calibration on two GPUs. Additionally, substituting raw images with textual descriptions introduces a more privacy-friendly alternative for retrieval. To further assess generalisation and address some of the shortcomings of prior compositionality benchmarks, we release two benchmarks derived from Flickr30k and COCO, containing diverse compositional queries made of short captions, which we coin subFlickr and subCOCO. Our vision-free retriever matches and often surpasses traditional multimodal models. Importantly, our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple retrieval and compositionality benchmarks, with models as small as 0.3B parameters.

<title>Long Story Short: Disentangling Compositionality and Long-Caption Understanding in VLMs</title>

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in binding visual and textual information, but understanding long, dense captions remains an open challenge. We hypothesize that compositionality, the capacity to reason about object-attribute bindings and inter-object relationships, is key to understanding longer captions. In this paper, we investigate the interaction between compositionality and long-caption understanding, asking whether training for one property enhances the other. We train and evaluate a range of models that target each of these capabilities. Our results reveal a bidirectional relationship: compositional training improves performance on long-caption retrieval, and training on long captions promotes compositionality. However, these gains are sensitive to data quality and model design. We find that training on poorly structured captions, or with limited parameter updates, fails to support generalization. Likewise, strategies that aim at retaining general alignment, such as freezing positional embeddings, do not improve compositional understanding. Overall, we find that compositional understanding and long-caption understanding are intertwined capabilities that can be jointly learned through training on dense, grounded descriptions. Despite these challenges, we show that models trained on high-quality, long-caption data can achieve strong performance in both tasks, offering practical guidance for improving VLM generalization.

Abstract: Accurate plant segmentation in thermal imagery remains a significant challenge for high throughput field phenotyping, particularly in outdoor environments where low contrast between plants and weeds and frequent occlusions hinder performance. To address this, we present a framework that leverages synthetic RGB imagery, a limited set of real annotations, and GAN-based cross-modality alignment to enhance semantic segmentation in thermal images. We trained models on 1,128 synthetic images containing complex mixtures of crop and weed plants in order to generate image segmentation masks for crop and weed plants. We additionally evaluated the benefit of integrating as few as five real, manually segmented field images within the training process using various sampling strategies. When combining all the synthetic images with a few labeled real images, we observed a maximum relative improvement of 22% for the weed class and 17% for the plant class compared to the full real-data baseline. Cross-modal alignment was enabled by translating RGB to thermal using CycleGAN-turbo, allowing robust template matching without calibration. Results demonstrated that combining synthetic data with limited manual annotations and cross-domain translation via generative models can significantly boost segmentation performance in complex field environments for multi-model imagery.

Abstract: Evaluation of hydrocephalus in children is challenging, and the related research is limited by a lack of publicly available, expert-annotated datasets, particularly those with segmentation of the choroid plexus. To address this, we present HyKid, an open-source dataset from 48 pediatric patients with hydrocephalus. 3D MRIs were provided with 1mm isotropic resolution, which was reconstructed from routine low-resolution images using a slice-to-volume algorithm. Manually corrected segmentations of brain tissues, including white matter, grey matter, lateral ventricle, external CSF, and the choroid plexus, were provided by an experienced neurologist. Additionally, structured data was extracted from clinical radiology reports using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework. The strong correlation between choroid plexus volume and total CSF volume provided a potential biomarker for hydrocephalus evaluation, achieving excellent performance in a predictive model (AUC = 0.87). The proposed HyKid dataset provided a high-quality benchmark for neuroimaging algorithms development, and it revealed the choroid plexus-related features in hydrocephalus assessments. Our datasets are publicly available at https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn68544889.

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of dashcams and advancements in computer vision, developing accident prediction models from the dashcam perspective has become critical for proactive safety interventions. However, two key challenges persist: modeling feature-level interactions among traffic participants (often occluded in dashcam views) and capturing complex, asynchronous multi-temporal behavioral cues preceding accidents. To deal with these two challenges, a Multi-scale Feature Interaction Network (MsFIN) is proposed for early-stage accident anticipation from dashcam videos. MsFIN has three layers for multi-scale feature aggregation, temporal feature processing and multi-scale feature post fusion, respectively. For multi-scale feature aggregation, a Multi-scale Module is designed to extract scene representations at short-term, mid-term and long-term temporal scales. Meanwhile, the Transformer architecture is leveraged to facilitate comprehensive feature interactions. Temporal feature processing captures the sequential evolution of scene and object features under causal constraints. In the multi-scale feature post fusion stage, the network fuses scene and object features across multiple temporal scales to generate a comprehensive risk representation. Experiments on DAD and DADA datasets show that MsFIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models with single-scale feature extraction in both prediction correctness and earliness. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each module in MsFIN, highlighting how the network achieves superior performance through multi-scale feature fusion and contextual interaction modeling.

Abstract: The rise of realistic digital face generation and manipulation poses significant social risks. The primary challenge lies in the rapid and diverse evolution of generation techniques, which often outstrip the detection capabilities of existing models. To defend against the ever-evolving new types of forgery, we need to enable our model to quickly adapt to new domains with limited computation and data while avoiding forgetting previously learned forgery types. In this work, we posit that genuine facial samples are abundant and relatively stable in acquisition methods, while forgery faces continuously evolve with the iteration of manipulation techniques. Given the practical infeasibility of exhaustively collecting all forgery variants, we frame face forgery detection as a continual learning problem and allow the model to develop as new forgery types emerge. Specifically, we employ a Developmental Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture that uses LoRA models as its individual experts. These experts are organized into two groups: a Real-LoRA to learn and refine knowledge of real faces, and multiple Fake-LoRAs to capture incremental information from different forgery types. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we ensure that the learning direction of Fake-LoRAs is orthogonal to the established subspace. Moreover, we integrate orthogonal gradients into the orthogonal loss of Fake-LoRAs, preventing gradient interference throughout the training process of each task. Experimental results under both the datasets and manipulation types incremental protocols demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: We proposed Lavida-O, a unified multi-modal Masked Diffusion Model (MDM) capable of image understanding and generation tasks. Unlike existing multimodal diffsion language models such as MMaDa and Muddit which only support simple image-level understanding tasks and low-resolution image generation, Lavida-O exhibits many new capabilities such as object grounding, image-editing, and high-resolution (1024px) image synthesis. It is also the first unified MDM that uses its understanding capabilities to improve image generation and editing results through planning and iterative self-reflection. To allow effective and efficient training and sampling, Lavida-O ntroduces many novel techniques such as Elastic Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, universal text conditioning, and stratified sampling. \ours~achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks such as RefCOCO object grounding, GenEval text-to-image generation, and ImgEdit image editing, outperforming existing autoregressive and continuous diffusion models such as Qwen2.5-VL and FluxKontext-dev, while offering considerable speedup at inference.

Abstract: What does it mean for two videos to be similar? Videos may appear similar when judged by the actions they depict, yet entirely different if evaluated based on the locations where they were filmed. While humans naturally compare videos by taking different aspects into account, this ability has not been thoroughly studied and presents a challenge for models that often depend on broad global similarity scores. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with video understanding capabilities open new opportunities for leveraging natural language in comparative video tasks. We introduce Concept-based Video Similarity estimation (ConViS), a novel task that compares pairs of videos by computing interpretable similarity scores across a predefined set of key semantic concepts. ConViS allows for human-like reasoning about video similarity and enables new applications such as concept-conditioned video retrieval. To support this task, we also introduce ConViS-Bench, a new benchmark comprising carefully annotated video pairs spanning multiple domains. Each pair comes with concept-level similarity scores and textual descriptions of both differences and similarities. Additionally, we benchmark several state-of-the-art models on ConViS, providing insights into their alignment with human judgments. Our results reveal significant performance differences on ConViS, indicating that some concepts present greater challenges for estimating video similarity. We believe that ConViS-Bench will serve as a valuable resource for advancing research in language-driven video understanding.

Abstract: Continuous human motion understanding remains a core challenge in computer vision due to its high dimensionality and inherent redundancy. Efficient compression and representation are crucial for analyzing complex motion dynamics. In this work, we introduce an adversarially-refined VQ-GAN framework with dense motion tokenization for compressing spatio-temporal heatmaps while preserving the fine-grained traces of human motion. Our approach combines dense motion tokenization with adversarial refinement, which eliminates reconstruction artifacts like motion smearing and temporal misalignment observed in non-adversarial baselines. Our experiments on the CMU Panoptic dataset provide conclusive evidence of our method's superiority, outperforming the dVAE baseline by 9.31% SSIM and reducing temporal instability by 37.1%. Furthermore, our dense tokenization strategy enables a novel analysis of motion complexity, revealing that 2D motion can be optimally represented with a compact 128-token vocabulary, while 3D motion's complexity demands a much larger 1024-token codebook for faithful reconstruction. These results establish practical deployment feasibility across diverse motion analysis applications. The code base for this work is available at https://github.com/TeCSAR-UNCC/Pose-Quantization.

Abstract: A significant challenge in solid tumors is reliably distinguishing confounding pathologies from malignant neoplasms on routine imaging. While radiomics methods seek surrogate markers of lesion heterogeneity on CT/MRI, many aggregate features across the region of interest (ROI) and miss complex spatial relationships among varying intensity compositions. We present a new Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) descriptor for characterizing intralesional heterogeneity (ILH) on clinical MRI scans. GrRAiL (1) identifies clusters of sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then (2) computes graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters. The resulting weighted graphs encode higher-order spatial relationships within the ROI, aiming to reliably capture ILH and disambiguate confounding pathologies from malignancy. To assess efficacy and clinical feasibility, GrRAiL was evaluated in n=947 subjects spanning three use cases: differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation effects in glioblastoma (GBM; n=106) and brain metastasis (n=233), and stratifying pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) into no+low vs high risk (n=608). In a multi-institutional setting, GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines - Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), textural radiomics, and intensity-graph analysis. In GBM, cross-validation (CV) and test accuracies for recurrence vs pseudo-progression were 89% and 78% with >10% test-accuracy gains over comparators. In brain metastasis, CV and test accuracies for recurrence vs radiation necrosis were 84% and 74% (>13% improvement). For IPMN risk stratification, CV and test accuracies were 84% and 75%, showing >10% improvement.

Abstract: The way we perceive the world fundamentally shapes how we move, whether it is how we navigate in a room or how we interact with other humans. Current human motion generation methods, neglect this interdependency and use task-specific ``perception'' that differs radically from that of humans. We argue that the generation of human-like avatar behavior requires human-like perception. Consequently, in this work we present CLOPS, the first human avatar that solely uses egocentric vision to perceive its surroundings and navigate. Using vision as the primary driver of motion however, gives rise to a significant challenge for training avatars: existing datasets have either isolated human motion, without the context of a scene, or lack scale. We overcome this challenge by decoupling the learning of low-level motion skills from learning of high-level control that maps visual input to motion. First, we train a motion prior model on a large motion capture dataset. Then, a policy is trained using Q-learning to map egocentric visual inputs to high-level control commands for the motion prior. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that egocentric vision can give rise to human-like motion characteristics in our avatars. For example, the avatars walk such that they avoid obstacles present in their visual field. These findings suggest that equipping avatars with human-like sensors, particularly egocentric vision, holds promise for training avatars that behave like humans.

Abstract: Despite steady progress in layout-to-image generation, current methods still struggle with layouts containing significant overlap between bounding boxes. We identify two primary challenges: (1) large overlapping regions and (2) overlapping instances with minimal semantic distinction. Through both qualitative examples and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate how these factors degrade generation quality. To systematically assess this issue, we introduce OverLayScore, a novel metric that quantifies the complexity of overlapping bounding boxes. Our analysis reveals that existing benchmarks are biased toward simpler cases with low OverLayScore values, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating model performance under more challenging conditions. To bridge this gap, we present OverLayBench, a new benchmark featuring high-quality annotations and a balanced distribution across different levels of OverLayScore. As an initial step toward improving performance on complex overlaps, we also propose CreatiLayout-AM, a model fine-tuned on a curated amodal mask dataset. Together, our contributions lay the groundwork for more robust layout-to-image generation under realistic and challenging scenarios. Project link: https://mlpc-ucsd.github.io/OverLayBench.

Abstract: The ability to generate virtual environments is crucial for applications ranging from gaming to physical AI domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and industrial AI. Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.

<title>VolSplat: Rethinking Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting with Voxel-Aligned Prediction</title>

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a highly effective solution for novel view synthesis. Existing methods predominantly rely on a pixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to a 3D Gaussian. We rethink this widely adopted formulation and identify several inherent limitations: it renders the reconstructed 3D models heavily dependent on the number of input views, leads to view-biased density distributions, and introduces alignment errors, particularly when source views contain occlusions or low texture. To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, a new multi-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with voxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D voxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature matching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables adaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding more faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and enhanced novel-view rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks including RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent Gaussian reconstructions. In addition to superior results, our approach establishes a more scalable framework for feed-forward 3D reconstruction with denser and more robust representations, paving the way for further research in wider communities. The video results, code and trained models are available on our project page: https://lhmd.top/volsplat.

Abstract: Conditional generative modeling aims to learn a conditional data distribution from samples containing data-condition pairs. For this, diffusion and flow-based methods have attained compelling results. These methods use a learned (flow) model to transport an initial standard Gaussian noise that ignores the condition to the conditional data distribution. The model is hence required to learn both mass transport and conditional injection. To ease the demand on the model, we propose Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow Matching (CAR-Flow) -- a lightweight, learned shift that conditions the source, the target, or both distributions. By relocating these distributions, CAR-Flow shortens the probability path the model must learn, leading to faster training in practice. On low-dimensional synthetic data, we visualize and quantify the effects of CAR. On higher-dimensional natural image data (ImageNet-256), equipping SiT-XL/2 with CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68, while introducing less than 0.6% additional parameters.

Abstract: Neural operator learning has emerged as a powerful approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in a data-driven manner. However, applying principal component analysis (PCA) to high-dimensional solution fields incurs significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose a patch-based PCA-Net framework that decomposes the solution fields into smaller patches, applies PCA within each patch, and trains a neural operator in the reduced PCA space. We investigate two different patch-based approaches that balance computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy: (1) local-to-global patch PCA, and (2) local-to-local patch PCA. The trade-off between computational cost and accuracy is analyzed, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each approach. Furthermore, within each approach, we explore two refinements for the most computationally efficient method: (i) introducing overlapping patches with a smoothing filter and (ii) employing a two-step process with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for refinement. Our results demonstrate that patch-based PCA significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy, reducing end-to-end pipeline processing time by a factor of 3.7 to 4 times compared to global PCA, thefore making it a promising technique for efficient operator learning in PDE-based systems.

Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in open-world settings depends heavily on their ability to flag out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs unseen during training. Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled promising few-shot OOD detection frameworks using only a handful of in-distribution (ID) samples. However, existing prompt learning-based OOD methods rely solely on softmax probabilities, overlooking the rich discriminative potential of the feature embeddings learned by VLMs trained on millions of samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel context optimization (CoOp)-based framework that integrates subspace representation learning with prompt tuning. Our approach improves ID-OOD separability by projecting the ID features into a subspace spanned by prompt vectors, while projecting ID-irrelevant features into an orthogonal null space. To train such OOD detection framework, we design an easy-to-handle end-to-end learning criterion that ensures strong OOD detection performance as well as high ID classification accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Reconstructing individual patient data (IPD) from Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots provides valuable insights for evidence synthesis in clinical research. However, existing approaches often rely on manual digitization, which is error-prone and lacks scalability. To address these limitations, we develop KM-GPT, the first fully automated, AI-powered pipeline for reconstructing IPD directly from KM plots with high accuracy, robustness, and reproducibility. KM-GPT integrates advanced image preprocessing, multi-modal reasoning powered by GPT-5, and iterative reconstruction algorithms to generate high-quality IPD without manual input or intervention. Its hybrid reasoning architecture automates the conversion of unstructured information into structured data flows and validates data extraction from complex KM plots. To improve accessibility, KM-GPT is equipped with a user-friendly web interface and an integrated AI assistant, enabling researchers to reconstruct IPD without requiring programming expertise. KM-GPT was rigorously evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, consistently demonstrating superior accuracy. To illustrate its utility, we applied KM-GPT to a meta-analysis of gastric cancer immunotherapy trials, reconstructing IPD to facilitate evidence synthesis and biomarker-based subgroup analyses. By automating traditionally manual processes and providing a scalable, web-based solution, KM-GPT transforms clinical research by leveraging reconstructed IPD to enable more informed downstream analyses, supporting evidence-based decision-making.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are undergoing rapid progress and represent the frontier of AI development. However, their training and inference efficiency have emerged as a core bottleneck in making MLLMs more accessible and scalable. To address the challenges, we present MiniCPM-V 4.5, an 8B parameter model designed for high efficiency and strong performance. We introduce three core improvements in model architecture, data strategy and training method: a unified 3D-Resampler model architecture for highly compact encoding over images and videos, a unified learning paradigm for document knowledge and text recognition without heavy data engineering, and a hybrid reinforcement learning strategy for proficiency in both short and long reasoning modes. Comprehensive experimental results in OpenCompass evaluation show that MiniCPM-V 4.5 surpasses widely used proprietary models such as GPT-4o-latest, and significantly larger open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL 72B. Notably, the strong performance is achieved with remarkable efficiency. For example, on the widely adopted VideoMME benchmark, MiniCPM-V 4.5 achieves state-of-the-art performance among models under 30B size, using just 46.7\% GPU memory cost and 8.7\% inference time of Qwen2.5-VL 7B.

Abstract: Accurate localisation is critical for mobile robots in structured outdoor environments, yet LiDAR-based methods often fail in vineyards due to repetitive row geometry and perceptual aliasing. We propose a semantic particle filter that incorporates stable object-level detections, specifically vine trunks and support poles into the likelihood estimation process. Detected landmarks are projected into a birds eye view and fused with LiDAR scans to generate semantic observations. A key innovation is the use of semantic walls, which connect adjacent landmarks into pseudo-structural constraints that mitigate row aliasing. To maintain global consistency in headland regions where semantics are sparse, we introduce a noisy GPS prior that adaptively supports the filter. Experiments in a real vineyard demonstrate that our approach maintains localisation within the correct row, recovers from deviations where AMCL fails, and outperforms vision-based SLAM methods such as RTAB-Map.

Abstract: Accurate dose calculation on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images is essential for modern proton treatment planning workflows, particularly when accounting for inter-fractional anatomical changes in adaptive treatment scenarios. Traditional CBCT-based dose calculation suffers from image quality limitations, requiring complex correction workflows. This study develops and validates a deep learning approach for direct proton dose calculation from CBCT images using extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) neural networks. A retrospective dataset of 40 head-and-neck cancer patients with paired planning CT and treatment CBCT images was used to train an xLSTM-based neural network (CBCT-NN). The architecture incorporates energy token encoding and beam's-eye-view sequence modelling to capture spatial dependencies in proton dose deposition patterns. Training utilized 82,500 paired beam configurations with Monte Carlo-generated ground truth doses. Validation was performed on 5 independent patients using gamma analysis, mean percentage dose error assessment, and dose-volume histogram comparison. The CBCT-NN achieved gamma pass rates of 95.1 $\pm$ 2.7% using 2mm/2% criteria. Mean percentage dose errors were 2.6 $\pm$ 1.4% in high-dose regions ($>$90% of max dose) and 5.9 $\pm$ 1.9% globally. Dose-volume histogram analysis showed excellent preservation of target coverage metrics (Clinical Target Volume V95% difference: -0.6 $\pm$ 1.1%) and organ-at-risk constraints (parotid mean dose difference: -0.5 $\pm$ 1.5%). Computation time is under 3 minutes without sacrificing Monte Carlo-level accuracy. This study demonstrates the proof-of-principle of direct CBCT-based proton dose calculation using xLSTM neural networks. The approach eliminates traditional correction workflows while achieving comparable accuracy and computational efficiency suitable for adaptive protocols.

Abstract: Visual assistive technologies, such as Microsoft Seeing AI, can improve access to environmental information for persons with blindness or low vision (pBLV). Yet, the physical and functional implications of different device embodiments remain unclear. In this study, 11 pBLV participants used Seeing AI on a hand-held smartphone and on a head-mounted ARx Vision system to perform six activities of daily living, while their movements were captured with Xsens motion capture. Functional outcomes included task time, success rate, and number of attempts, and biomechanical measures included joint range of motion, angular path length, working volume, and movement smoothness. The head-mounted system generally reduced upper-body movement and task time, especially for document-scanning style tasks, whereas the hand-held system yielded higher success rates for tasks involving small or curved text. These findings indicate that both embodiments are viable, but they differ in terms of physical demands and ease of use. Incorporating biomechanical measures into assistive technology evaluations can inform designs that optimise user experience by balancing functional efficiency, physical sustainability, and intuitive interaction.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have gained popularity for learning robotic manipulation tasks that follow language instructions. State-of-the-art VLAs, such as OpenVLA and $\pi_{0}$, were trained on large-scale, manually labeled action datasets collected through teleoperation. More recent approaches, including LAPA and villa-X, introduce latent action representations that enable unsupervised pretraining on unlabeled datasets by modeling abstract visual changes between frames. Although these methods have shown strong results, their large model sizes make deployment in real-world settings challenging. In this work, we propose LAWM, a model-agnostic framework to pretrain imitation learning models in a self-supervised way, by learning latent action representations from unlabeled video data through world modeling. These videos can be sourced from robot recordings or videos of humans performing actions with everyday objects. Our framework is designed to be effective for transferring across tasks, environments, and embodiments. It outperforms models trained with ground-truth robotics actions and similar pretraining methods on the LIBERO benchmark and real-world setup, while being significantly more efficient and practical for real-world settings.

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have dramatically advanced deepfake technology, and its threats to digital security, media integrity, and public trust have increased rapidly. This research explored zero-shot deepfake detection, an emerging method even when the models have never seen a particular deepfake variation. In this work, we studied self-supervised learning, transformer-based zero-shot classifier, generative model fingerprinting, and meta-learning techniques that better adapt to the ever-evolving deepfake threat. In addition, we suggested AI-driven prevention strategies that mitigated the underlying generation pipeline of the deepfakes before they occurred. They consisted of adversarial perturbations for creating deepfake generators, digital watermarking for content authenticity verification, real-time AI monitoring for content creation pipelines, and blockchain-based content verification frameworks. Despite these advancements, zero-shot detection and prevention faced critical challenges such as adversarial attacks, scalability constraints, ethical dilemmas, and the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks. These limitations were addressed by discussing future research directions on explainable AI for deepfake detection, multimodal fusion based on image, audio, and text analysis, quantum AI for enhanced security, and federated learning for privacy-preserving deepfake detection. This further highlighted the need for an integrated defense framework for digital authenticity that utilized zero-shot learning in combination with preventive deepfake mechanisms. Finally, we highlighted the important role of interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers, cybersecurity experts, and policymakers to create resilient defenses against the rising tide of deepfake attacks.

Abstract: The nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) is a fundamental model for wave dynamics in nonlinear media ranging from optical fibers to Bose-Einstein condensates. Accurately estimating its parameters, which are often strongly correlated, from a single measurement remains a significant challenge. We address this problem by treating parameter estimation as an inverse problem and training a neural network to invert the NLSE mapping. We combine a fast numerical solver with a machine learning approach based on the ConvNeXt architecture and a multivariate Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss function. From single-shot field (density and phase) images, our model estimates three key parameters: the nonlinear coefficient $n_2$, the saturation intensity $I_{sat}$, and the linear absorption coefficient $\alpha$. Trained on 100,000 simulated images, the model achieves a mean absolute error of $3.22\%$ on 12,500 unseen test samples, demonstrating strong generalization and close agreement with ground-truth values. This approach provides an efficient route for characterizing nonlinear systems and has the potential to bridge theoretical modeling and experimental data when realistic noise is incorporated.

Abstract: Radiance fields have gained tremendous success with applications ranging from novel view synthesis to geometry reconstruction, especially with the advent of Gaussian splatting. However, they sacrifice modeling of material reflective properties and lighting conditions, leading to significant geometric ambiguities and the inability to easily perform relighting. One way to address these limitations is to incorporate physically-based rendering, but it has been prohibitively expensive to include full global illumination within the inner loop of the optimization. Therefore, previous works adopt simplifications that make the whole optimization with global illumination effects efficient but less accurate. In this work, we adopt Gaussian surfels as the primitives and build an efficient framework for differentiable light transport, inspired from the classic radiosity theory. The whole framework operates in the coefficient space of spherical harmonics, enabling both diffuse and specular materials. We extend the classic radiosity into non-binary visibility and semi-opaque primitives, propose novel solvers to efficiently solve the light transport, and derive the backward pass for gradient optimizations, which is more efficient than auto-differentiation. During inference, we achieve view-independent rendering where light transport need not be recomputed under viewpoint changes, enabling hundreds of FPS for global illumination effects, including view-dependent reflections using a spherical harmonics representation. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate superior geometry reconstruction, view synthesis and relighting than previous inverse rendering baselines, or data-driven baselines given relatively sparse datasets with known or unknown lighting conditions.

Abstract: High-dimensional imaging of neural activity, such as widefield calcium and functional ultrasound imaging, provide a rich source of information for understanding the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Accurately modeling neural dynamics in these modalities is crucial for understanding this relationship but is hindered by the high-dimensionality, complex spatiotemporal dependencies, and prevalent behaviorally irrelevant dynamics in these modalities. Existing dynamical models often employ preprocessing steps to obtain low-dimensional representations from neural image modalities. However, this process can discard behaviorally relevant information and miss spatiotemporal structure. We propose SBIND, a novel data-driven deep learning framework to model spatiotemporal dependencies in neural images and disentangle their behaviorally relevant dynamics from other neural dynamics. We validate SBIND on widefield imaging datasets, and show its extension to functional ultrasound imaging, a recent modality whose dynamical modeling has largely remained unexplored. We find that our model effectively identifies both local and long-range spatial dependencies across the brain while also dissociating behaviorally relevant neural dynamics. Doing so, SBIND outperforms existing models in neural-behavioral prediction. Overall, SBIND provides a versatile tool for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying behavior using imaging modalities.

Abstract: Cancer is one of the leading health challenges for women, specifically breast and ovarian cancer. Early detection can help improve the survival rate through timely intervention and treatment. Traditional methods of detecting cancer involve manually examining mammograms, CT scans, ultrasounds, and other imaging types. However, this makes the process labor-intensive and requires the expertise of trained pathologists. Hence, making it both time-consuming and resource-intensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel vision transformer (ViT)-based method for detecting and classifying breast and ovarian cancer. We use a pre-trained ViT-Base-Patch16-224 model, which is fine-tuned for both binary and multi-class classification tasks using publicly available histopathological image datasets. Further, we use a preprocessing pipeline that converts raw histophological images into standardized PyTorch tensors, which are compatible with the ViT architecture and also help improve the model performance. We evaluated the performance of our model on two benchmark datasets: the BreakHis dataset for binary classification and the UBC-OCEAN dataset for five-class classification without any data augmentation. Our model surpasses existing CNN, ViT, and topological data analysis-based approaches in binary classification. For multi-class classification, it is evaluated against recent topological methods and demonstrates superior performance. Our study highlights the effectiveness of Vision Transformer-based transfer learning combined with efficient preprocessing in oncological diagnostics.

Abstract: Rapid adaptation in unseen environments is essential for scalable real-world autonomy, yet existing approaches rely on exhaustive exploration or rigid navigation policies that fail to generalize. We present VLN-Zero, a two-phase vision-language navigation framework that leverages vision-language models to efficiently construct symbolic scene graphs and enable zero-shot neurosymbolic navigation. In the exploration phase, structured prompts guide VLM-based search toward informative and diverse trajectories, yielding compact scene graph representations. In the deployment phase, a neurosymbolic planner reasons over the scene graph and environmental observations to generate executable plans, while a cache-enabled execution module accelerates adaptation by reusing previously computed task-location trajectories. By combining rapid exploration, symbolic reasoning, and cache-enabled execution, the proposed framework overcomes the computational inefficiency and poor generalization of prior vision-language navigation methods, enabling robust and scalable decision-making in unseen environments. VLN-Zero achieves 2x higher success rate compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot models, outperforms most fine-tuned baselines, and reaches goal locations in half the time with 55% fewer VLM calls on average compared to state-of-the-art models across diverse environments. Codebase, datasets, and videos for VLN-Zero are available at: https://vln-zero.github.io/.

Abstract: Conventional Fourier-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (FD-OCT) systems depend on resampling into wavenumber (k) domain to extract the depth profile. This either necessitates additional hardware resources or amplifies the existing computational complexity. Moreover, the OCT images also suffer from speckle noise, due to systemic reliance on low coherence interferometry. We propose a streamlined and computationally efficient approach based on Deep-Learning (DL) which enables reconstructing speckle-reduced OCT images directly from the wavelength domain. For reconstruction, two encoder-decoder styled networks namely Spatial Domain Convolution Neural Network (SD-CNN) and Fourier Domain CNN (FD-CNN) are used sequentially. The SD-CNN exploits the highly degraded images obtained by Fourier transforming the domain fringes to reconstruct the deteriorated morphological structures along with suppression of unwanted noise. The FD-CNN leverages this output to enhance the image quality further by optimization in Fourier domain (FD). We quantitatively and visually demonstrate the efficacy of the method in obtaining high-quality OCT images. Furthermore, we illustrate the computational complexity reduction by harnessing the power of DL models. We believe that this work lays the framework for further innovations in the realm of OCT image reconstruction.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the point cloud registration problem, where well-known methods like ICP fail under uncertainty arising from sensor noise, pose-estimation errors, and partial overlap due to occlusion. We develop a novel approach, Gaussian Process Concept Attribution (GP-CA), which not only quantifies registration uncertainty but also explains it by attributing uncertainty to well-known sources of errors in registration problems. Our approach leverages active learning to discover new uncertainty sources in the wild by querying informative instances. We validate GP-CA on three publicly available datasets and in our real-world robot experiment. Extensive ablations substantiate our design choices. Our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of runtime, high sample-efficiency with active learning, and high accuracy. Our real-world experiment clearly demonstrates its applicability. Our video also demonstrates that GP-CA enables effective failure-recovery behaviors, yielding more robust robotic perception.

Abstract: Human skin provides a rich tactile sensing stream, localizing intentional and unintentional contact events over a large and contoured region. Replicating these tactile sensing capabilities for dexterous robotic manipulation systems remains a longstanding challenge. In this work, we take a step towards this goal by introducing DexSkin. DexSkin is a soft, conformable capacitive electronic skin that enables sensitive, localized, and calibratable tactile sensing, and can be tailored to varying geometries. We demonstrate its efficacy for learning downstream robotic manipulation by sensorizing a pair of parallel jaw gripper fingers, providing tactile coverage across almost the entire finger surfaces. We empirically evaluate DexSkin's capabilities in learning challenging manipulation tasks that require sensing coverage across the entire surface of the fingers, such as reorienting objects in hand and wrapping elastic bands around boxes, in a learning-from-demonstration framework. We then show that, critically for data-driven approaches, DexSkin can be calibrated to enable model transfer across sensor instances, and demonstrate its applicability to online reinforcement learning on real robots. Our results highlight DexSkin's suitability and practicality for learning real-world, contact-rich manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image and video synthesis. In addition, several concept control methods have been proposed to enable fine-grained, continuous, and flexible control over free-form text prompts. However, these methods not only require intensive training time and GPU memory usage to learn the sliders or embeddings but also need to be retrained for different diffusion backbones, limiting their scalability and adaptability. To address these limitations, we introduce Text Slider, a lightweight, efficient and plug-and-play framework that identifies low-rank directions within a pre-trained text encoder, enabling continuous control of visual concepts while significantly reducing training time, GPU memory consumption, and the number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, Text Slider supports multi-concept composition and continuous control, enabling fine-grained and flexible manipulation in both image and video synthesis. We show that Text Slider enables smooth and continuous modulation of specific attributes while preserving the original spatial layout and structure of the input. Text Slider achieves significantly better efficiency: 5$\times$ faster training than Concept Slider and 47$\times$ faster than Attribute Control, while reducing GPU memory usage by nearly 2$\times$ and 4$\times$, respectively.

Abstract: An integer winding, i.e., topological charge, is a characteristic of skyrmions, which are topologically nontrivial spin patterns in magnets. They emerge when smooth two-dimensional spin configurations are stabilized by conflicting interactions such as exchange, anisotropy, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, or geometric frustration. These nanoscale textures, which are typically a few to tens of nanometers in size, are strong 'particle-like' excitations because they are shielded by energy barriers connected to their topology. By exploiting their helicity, i.e., spin rotation angle or associated internal modes, as a two-level system, skyrmions can function as quantum bits or qubits. Two quantized helicity states of a nanometer-scale skyrmion encode the logical value states in a 'skyrmion qubit.' Interestingly, skyrmion qubits are topologically protected and macroscopic, i.e., they involve a large number of spins; however, external influences can still affect them. When the texture is tiny and disconnected, the helicity angle of the skyrmion becomes quantized. A qubit basis is made up of the lowest two energy eigenstates, i.e., symmetric or antisymmetric superpositions of opposite helicity, for example. Therefore, Skyrmion textures can provide valuable insights for different purposes. However, is it possible to synthetically generate skyrmion textures using quantum computing? This paper investigates the possibility and generates a few hundred different textures, producing sample comparisons from various types, which indicate a novel direction for skyrmion-based research based on quantum randomness and other criteria.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced image manipulation techniques, and their ability to generate photorealistic images is beginning to transform retail workflows, particularly in presale visualization. Beyond artistic style transfer, the capability to perform fine-grained visual feature transfer is becoming increasingly important. Embroidery is a textile art form characterized by intricate interplay of diverse stitch patterns and material properties, which poses unique challenges for existing style transfer methods. To explore the customization for such fine-grained features, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework that disentangles fine-grained style and content features with a single reference image, building on the classic concept of image analogy. We first construct an image pair to define the target style, and then adopt a similarity metric based on the decoupled representations of pretrained diffusion models for style-content separation. Subsequently, we propose a two-stage contrastive LoRA modulation technique to capture fine-grained style features. In the first stage, we iteratively update the whole LoRA and the selected style blocks to initially separate style from content. In the second stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to further decouple style and content through self-knowledge distillation. Finally, we build an inference pipeline to handle image or text inputs with only the style blocks. To evaluate our method on fine-grained style transfer, we build a benchmark for embroidery customization. Our approach surpasses prior methods on this task and further demonstrates strong generalization to three additional domains: artistic style transfer, sketch colorization, and appearance transfer.

<title>Towards Robust LiDAR Localization: Deep Learning-based Uncertainty Estimation</title>

Abstract: LiDAR-based localization and SLAM often rely on iterative matching algorithms, particularly the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, to align sensor data with pre-existing maps or previous scans. However, ICP is prone to errors in featureless environments and dynamic scenes, leading to inaccurate pose estimation. Accurately predicting the uncertainty associated with ICP is crucial for robust state estimation but remains challenging, as existing approaches often rely on handcrafted models or simplified assumptions. Moreover, a few deep learning-based methods for localizability estimation either depend on a pre-built map, which may not always be available, or provide a binary classification of localizable versus non-localizable, which fails to properly model uncertainty. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework that leverages deep learning to estimate the registration error covariance of ICP before matching, even in the absence of a reference map. By associating each LiDAR scan with a reliable 6-DoF error covariance estimate, our method enables seamless integration of ICP within Kalman filtering, enhancing localization accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it accurately predicts covariance and, when applied to localization using a pre-built map or SLAM, reduces localization errors and improves robustness.

Abstract: Object shape and pose estimation is a foundational robotics problem, supporting tasks from manipulation to scene understanding and navigation. We present a fast local solver for shape and pose estimation which requires only category-level object priors and admits an efficient certificate of global optimality. Given an RGB-D image of an object, we use a learned front-end to detect sparse, category-level semantic keypoints on the target object. We represent the target object's unknown shape using a linear active shape model and pose a maximum a posteriori optimization problem to solve for position, orientation, and shape simultaneously. Expressed in unit quaternions, this problem admits first-order optimality conditions in the form of an eigenvalue problem with eigenvector nonlinearities. Our primary contribution is to solve this problem efficiently with self-consistent field iteration, which only requires computing a 4-by-4 matrix and finding its minimum eigenvalue-vector pair at each iterate. Solving a linear system for the corresponding Lagrange multipliers gives a simple global optimality certificate. One iteration of our solver runs in about 100 microseconds, enabling fast outlier rejection. We test our method on synthetic data and a variety of real-world settings, including two public datasets and a drone tracking scenario. Code is released at https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/Fast-ShapeAndPose.

Abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks remain challenging due to limited access to model internals. Existing methods often depend on specific network architectures or require numerous queries, resulting in limited cross-architecture transferability and high query costs. To address these limitations, we propose JAD, a latent diffusion model framework for black-box adversarial attacks. JAD generates adversarial examples by leveraging a latent diffusion model guided by attention maps distilled from both a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) models. By focusing on image regions that are commonly sensitive across architectures, this approach crafts adversarial perturbations that transfer effectively between different model types. This joint attention distillation strategy enables JAD to be architecture-agnostic, achieving superior attack generalization across diverse models. Moreover, the generative nature of the diffusion framework yields high adversarial sample generation efficiency by reducing reliance on iterative queries. Experiments demonstrate that JAD offers improved attack generalization, generation efficiency, and cross-architecture transferability compared to existing methods, providing a promising and effective paradigm for black-box adversarial attacks.

Abstract: General-purpose robotic skills from end-to-end demonstrations often leads to task-specific policies that fail to generalize beyond the training distribution. Therefore, we introduce FunCanon, a framework that converts long-horizon manipulation tasks into sequences of action chunks, each defined by an actor, verb, and object. These chunks focus policy learning on the actions themselves, rather than isolated tasks, enabling compositionality and reuse. To make policies pose-aware and category-general, we perform functional object canonicalization for functional alignment and automatic manipulation trajectory transfer, mapping objects into shared functional frames using affordance cues from large vision language models. An object centric and action centric diffusion policy FuncDiffuser trained on this aligned data naturally respects object affordances and poses, simplifying learning and improving generalization ability. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks demonstrate category-level generalization, cross-task behavior reuse, and robust sim2real deployment, showing that functional canonicalization provides a strong inductive bias for scalable imitation learning in complex manipulation domains. Details of the demo and supplemental material are available on our project website https://sites.google.com/view/funcanon.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of numerous neurofibromas (NFs) throughout the body. Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is the clinical standard for detection and longitudinal surveillance of NF tumor growth. Existing interactive segmentation methods fail to combine high lesion-wise precision with scalability to hundreds of lesions. This study proposes a novel interactive segmentation model tailored to this challenge.
  Methods: We introduce MOIS-SAM2, a multi-object interactive segmentation model that extends the state-of-the-art, transformer-based, promptable Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) with exemplar-based semantic propagation. MOIS-SAM2 was trained and evaluated on 119 WB-MRI scans from 84 NF1 patients acquired using T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences. The dataset was split at the patient level into a training set and four test sets (one in-domain and three reflecting different domain shift scenarios, e.g., MRI field strength variation, low tumor burden, differences in clinical site and scanner vendor).
  Results: On the in-domain test set, MOIS-SAM2 achieved a scan-wise DSC of 0.60 against expert manual annotations, outperforming baseline 3D nnU-Net (DSC: 0.54) and SAM2 (DSC: 0.35). Performance of the proposed model was maintained under MRI field strength shift (DSC: 0.53) and scanner vendor variation (DSC: 0.50), and improved in low tumor burden cases (DSC: 0.61). Lesion detection F1 scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.78 across test sets. Preliminary inter-reader variability analysis showed model-to-expert agreement (DSC: 0.62-0.68), comparable to inter-expert agreement (DSC: 0.57-0.69).
  Conclusions: The proposed MOIS-SAM2 enables efficient and scalable interactive segmentation of NFs in WB-MRI with minimal user input and strong generalization, supporting integration into clinical workflows.

Abstract: In the superpixel literature, the comparison of state-of-the-art methods can be biased by the non-robustness of some metrics to decomposition aspects, such as the superpixel scale. Moreover, most recent decomposition methods allow to set a shape regularity parameter, which can have a substantial impact on the measured performances. In this paper, we introduce an evaluation framework, that aims to unify the comparison process of superpixel methods. We investigate the limitations of existing metrics, and propose to evaluate each of the three core decomposition aspects: color homogeneity, respect of image objects and shape regularity. To measure the regularity aspect, we propose a new global regularity measure (GR), which addresses the non-robustness of state-of-the-art metrics. We evaluate recent superpixel methods with these criteria, at several superpixel scales and regularity levels. The proposed framework reduces the bias in the comparison process of state-of-the-art superpixel methods. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed GR measure is correlated with the performances of various applications.

Abstract: State-of-The-Art (SoTA) image captioning models are often trained on the MicroSoft Common Objects in Context (MS-COCO) dataset, which contains human-annotated captions with an average length of approximately ten tokens. Although effective for general scene understanding, these short captions often fail to capture complex scenes and convey detailed information. Moreover, captioning models tend to exhibit bias towards the ``average'' caption, which captures only the more general aspects, thus overlooking finer details. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate richer and more informative image captions by combining the captions generated from different SoTA captioning models. Our proposed method requires no additional model training: given an image, it leverages pre-trained models from the literature to generate the initial captions, and then ranks them using a newly introduced image-text-based metric, which we name BLIPScore. Subsequently, the top two captions are fused using a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the final, more detailed description. Experimental results on the MS-COCO and Flickr30k test sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of caption-image alignment and hallucination reduction according to the ALOHa, CAPTURE, and Polos metrics. A subjective study lends additional support to these results, suggesting that the captions produced by our model are generally perceived as more consistent with human judgment. By combining the strengths of diverse SoTA models, our method enhances the quality and appeal of image captions, bridging the gap between automated systems and the rich and informative nature of human-generated descriptions. This advance enables the generation of more suitable captions for the training of both vision-language and captioning models.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are successful in various computer vision tasks. From an image and signal processing point of view, this success is counter-intuitive, as the inherent spatial pyramid design of most CNNs is apparently violating basic signal processing laws, i.e. the Sampling Theorem in their downsampling operations. This issue has been broadly neglected until recent work in the context of adversarial attacks and distribution shifts showed that there is a strong correlation between the vulnerability of CNNs and aliasing artifacts induced by bandlimit-violating downsampling. As a remedy, we propose an alias-free downsampling operation in the frequency domain, denoted Frequency Low Cut Pooling (FLC Pooling) which we further extend to Aliasing and Sinc Artifact-free Pooling (ASAP). ASAP is alias-free and removes further artifacts from sinc-interpolation. Our experimental evaluation on ImageNet-1k, ImageNet-C and CIFAR datasets on various CNN architectures demonstrates that networks using FLC Pooling and ASAP as downsampling methods learn more stable features as measured by their robustness against common corruptions and adversarial attacks, while maintaining a clean accuracy similar to the respective baseline models.

Abstract: Understanding individual differences in cortical structure is key to advancing diagnostics in neurology and psychiatry. Reference models aid in detecting aberrant cortical thickness, yet site-specific biases limit their direct application to unseen data, and region-wise averages prevent the detection of localized cortical changes. To address these limitations, we developed the Stochastic Cortical Self-Reconstruction (SCSR), a novel method that leverages deep learning to reconstruct cortical thickness maps at the vertex level without needing additional subject information. Trained on over 25,000 healthy individuals, SCSR generates highly individualized cortical reconstructions that can detect subtle thickness deviations. Our evaluations on independent test sets demonstrated that SCSR achieved significantly lower reconstruction errors and identified atrophy patterns that enabled better disease discrimination than established methods. It also hints at cortical thinning in preterm infants that went undetected by existing models, showcasing its versatility. Finally, SCSR excelled in mapping highly resolved cortical deviations of dementia patients from clinical data, highlighting its potential for supporting diagnosis in clinical practice.

Abstract: Deep learning algorithms require extensive data to achieve robust performance. However, data availability is often restricted in the medical domain due to patient privacy concerns. Synthetic data presents a possible solution to these challenges. Recently, image generative models have found increasing use for medical applications but are often designed for singular medical specialties and imaging modalities, thus limiting their broader utility. To address this, we introduce MediSyn: a text-guided, latent diffusion model capable of generating synthetic images from 6 medical specialties and 10 image types. Through extensive experimentation, we first demonstrate that MediSyn quantitatively matches or surpasses the performance of specialist models. Second, we show that our synthetic images are realistic and exhibit strong alignment with their corresponding text prompts, as validated by a team of expert physicians. Third, we provide empirical evidence that our synthetic images are visually distinct from their corresponding real patient images. Finally, we demonstrate that in data-limited settings, classifiers trained solely on synthetic data or real data supplemented with synthetic data can outperform those trained solely on real data. Our findings highlight the immense potential of generalist image generative models to accelerate algorithmic research and development in medicine.

Abstract: Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is a task that encodes visual relationships between objects in images as graph structures. SGG shows significant promise as a foundational component for downstream tasks, such as reasoning for embodied agents. To enable real-time applications, SGG must address the trade-off between performance and inference speed. However, current methods tend to focus on one of the following: (1) improving relation prediction accuracy, (2) enhancing object detection accuracy, or (3) reducing latency, without aiming to balance all three objectives simultaneously. To address this limitation, we propose the Real-time Efficiency and Accuracy Compromise for Tradeoffs in Scene Graph Generation (REACT) architecture, which achieves the highest inference speed among existing SGG models, improving object detection accuracy without sacrificing relation prediction performance. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, REACT is 2.7 times faster and improves object detection accuracy by 58\%. Furthermore, our proposal significantly reduces model size, with an average of 5.5x fewer parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/Maelic/SGG-Benchmark

Abstract: Over the years, the use of superpixel segmentation has become very popular in various applications, serving as a preprocessing step to reduce data size by adapting to the content of the image, regardless of its semantic content. While the superpixel segmentation of standard planar images, captured with a 90{\deg} field of view, has been extensively studied, there has been limited focus on dedicated methods to omnidirectional or spherical images, captured with a 360{\deg} field of view. In this study, we introduce the first deep learning-based superpixel segmentation approach tailored for omnidirectional images called DSS (for Deep Spherical Superpixels). Our methodology leverages on spherical CNN architectures and the differentiable K-means clustering paradigm for superpixels, to generate superpixels that follow the spherical geometry. Additionally, we propose to use data augmentation techniques specifically designed for 360{\deg} images, enabling our model to efficiently learn from a limited set of annotated omnidirectional data. Our extensive validation across two datasets demonstrates that taking into account the inherent circular geometry of such images into our framework improves the segmentation performance over traditional and deep learning-based superpixel methods. Our code is available online.

<title>Your Turn: At Home Turning Angle Estimation for Parkinson's Disease Severity Assessment</title>

Abstract: People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) often experience progressively worsening gait, including changes in how they turn around, as the disease progresses. Existing clinical rating tools are not capable of capturing hour-by-hour variations of PD symptoms, as they are confined to brief assessments within clinic settings. Measuring gait turning angles continuously and passively is a component step towards using gait characteristics as sensitive indicators of disease progression in PD. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach to automatically quantify turning angles by extracting 3D skeletons from videos and calculating the rotation of hip and knee joints. We utilise state-of-the-art human pose estimation models, Fastpose and Strided Transformer, on a total of 1386 turning video clips from 24 subjects (12 people with PD and 12 healthy control volunteers), trimmed from a PD dataset of unscripted free-living videos in a home-like setting (Turn-REMAP). We also curate a turning video dataset, Turn-H3.6M, from the public Human3.6M human pose benchmark with 3D ground truth, to further validate our method. Previous gait research has primarily taken place in clinics or laboratories evaluating scripted gait outcomes, but this work focuses on free-living home settings where complexities exist, such as baggy clothing and poor lighting. Due to difficulties in obtaining accurate ground truth data in a free-living setting, we quantise the angle into the nearest bin $45^\circ$ based on the manual labelling of expert clinicians. Our method achieves a turning calculation accuracy of 41.6%, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 34.7{\deg}, and a weighted precision WPrec of 68.3% for Turn-REMAP. This is the first work to explore the use of single monocular camera data to quantify turns by PD patients in a home setting.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a promising approach for modeling 3D scenes using mixtures of Gaussians. The predominant optimization method for these models relies on backpropagating gradients through a differentiable rendering pipeline, which struggles with catastrophic forgetting when dealing with continuous streams of data. To address this limitation, we propose Variational Bayes Gaussian Splatting (VBGS), a novel approach that frames training a Gaussian splat as variational inference over model parameters. By leveraging the conjugacy properties of multivariate Gaussians, we derive a closed-form variational update rule, allowing efficient updates from partial, sequential observations without the need for replay buffers. Our experiments show that VBGS not only matches state-of-the-art performance on static datasets, but also enables continual learning from sequentially streamed 2D and 3D data, drastically improving performance in this setting.

Abstract: The field of Remote Sensing Domain Generalization (RSDG) has emerged as a critical and valuable research frontier, focusing on developing models that generalize effectively across diverse scenarios. Despite the substantial domain gaps in RS images that are characterized by variabilities such as location, wavelength, and sensor type, research in this area remains underexplored: (1) Current cross-domain methods primarily focus on Domain Adaptation (DA), which adapts models to predefined domains rather than to unseen ones; (2) Few studies targeting the RSDG issue, especially for semantic segmentation tasks, where existing models are developed for specific unknown domains, struggling with issues of underfitting on other unknown scenarios; (3) Existing RS foundation models tend to prioritize in-domain performance over cross-domain generalization. To this end, we introduce the first vision foundation model for RSDG semantic segmentation, CrossEarth. CrossEarth demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization through a specially designed data-level Earth-Style Injection pipeline and a model-level Multi-Task Training pipeline. In addition, for the semantic segmentation task, we have curated an RSDG benchmark comprising 32 cross-domain settings across various regions, spectral bands, platforms, and climates, providing a comprehensive framework for testing the generalizability of future RSDG models. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the superiority of CrossEarth over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We introduce EMMA, an End-to-end Multimodal Model for Autonomous driving. Built upon a multi-modal large language model foundation like Gemini, EMMA directly maps raw camera sensor data into various driving-specific outputs, including planner trajectories, perception objects, and road graph elements. EMMA maximizes the utility of world knowledge from the pre-trained large language models, by representing all non-sensor inputs (e.g. navigation instructions and ego vehicle status) and outputs (e.g. trajectories and 3D locations) as natural language text. This approach allows EMMA to jointly process various driving tasks in a unified language space, and generate the outputs for each task using task-specific prompts. Empirically, we demonstrate EMMA's effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance in motion planning on nuScenes as well as competitive results on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). EMMA also yields competitive results for camera-primary 3D object detection on the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). We show that co-training EMMA with planner trajectories, object detection, and road graph tasks yields improvements across all three domains, highlighting EMMA's potential as a generalist model for autonomous driving applications. We hope that our results will inspire research to further evolve the state of the art in autonomous driving model architectures.

Abstract: For many years, image over-segmentation into superpixels has been essential to computer vision pipelines, by creating homogeneous and identifiable regions of similar sizes. Such constrained segmentation problem would require a clear definition and specific evaluation criteria. However, the validation framework for superpixel methods, typically viewed as standard object segmentation, has rarely been thoroughly studied. In this work, we first take a step back to show that superpixel segmentation is fundamentally an ill-posed problem, due to the implicit regularity constraint on the shape and size of superpixels. We also demonstrate through a novel comprehensive study that the literature suffers from only evaluating certain aspects, sometimes incorrectly and with inappropriate metrics. Concurrently, recent deep learning-based superpixel methods mainly focus on the object segmentation task at the expense of regularity. In this ill-posed context, we show that we can achieve competitive results using a recent architecture like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), without dedicated training for the superpixel segmentation task. This leads to rethinking superpixel segmentation and the necessary properties depending on the targeted downstream task.

<title>SparseDiT: Token Sparsification for Efficient Diffusion Transformer</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT) are renowned for their impressive generative performance; however, they are significantly constrained by considerable computational costs due to the quadratic complexity in self-attention and the extensive sampling steps required. While advancements have been made in expediting the sampling process, the underlying architectural inefficiencies within DiT remain underexplored. We introduce SparseDiT, a novel framework that implements token sparsification across spatial and temporal dimensions to enhance computational efficiency while preserving generative quality. Spatially, SparseDiT employs a tri-segment architecture that allocates token density based on feature requirements at each layer: Poolingformer in the bottom layers for efficient global feature extraction, Sparse-Dense Token Modules (SDTM) in the middle layers to balance global context with local detail, and dense tokens in the top layers to refine high-frequency details. Temporally, SparseDiT dynamically modulates token density across denoising stages, progressively increasing token count as finer details emerge in later timesteps. This synergy between SparseDiT spatially adaptive architecture and its temporal pruning strategy enables a unified framework that balances efficiency and fidelity throughout the generation process. Our experiments demonstrate SparseDiT effectiveness, achieving a 55% reduction in FLOPs and a 175% improvement in inference speed on DiT-XL with similar FID score on 512x512 ImageNet, a 56% reduction in FLOPs across video generation datasets, and a 69% improvement in inference speed on PixArt-$\alpha$ on text-to-image generation task with a 0.24 FID score decrease. SparseDiT provides a scalable solution for high-quality diffusion-based generation compatible with sampling optimization techniques.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been demonstrated to be highly effective in mitigating hallucinations in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) by aligning their outputs more closely with human preferences. Despite the recent progress, existing methods suffer from two drawbacks: 1) Lack of scalable token-level rewards; and 2) Neglect of visual-anchored tokens. To this end, we propose a novel Token Preference Optimization model with self-calibrated rewards (dubbed as TPO), which adaptively attends to visual-correlated tokens without fine-grained annotations. Specifically, we introduce a token-level \emph{visual-anchored} \emph{reward} as the difference of the logistic distributions of generated tokens conditioned on the raw image and the corrupted one. In addition, to highlight the informative visual-anchored tokens, a visual-aware training objective is proposed to enhance more accurate token-level optimization. Extensive experimental results have manifested the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed TPO. For example, by building on top of LLAVA-1.5-7B, our TPO boosts the performance absolute improvement for hallucination benchmarks.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Monitoring Anomaly Detection (WSMAD) utilizes weak supervision learning to identify anomalies, a critical task for smart city monitoring. However, existing multimodal approaches often fail to meet the real-time and interpretability requirements of edge devices due to their complexity. This paper presents TCVADS (Two-stage Cross-modal Video Anomaly Detection System), which leverages knowledge distillation and cross-modal contrastive learning to enable efficient, accurate, and interpretable anomaly detection on edge devices.TCVADS operates in two stages: coarse-grained rapid classification and fine-grained detailed analysis. In the first stage, TCVADS extracts features from video frames and inputs them into a time series analysis module, which acts as the teacher model. Insights are then transferred via knowledge distillation to a simplified convolutional network (student model) for binary classification. Upon detecting an anomaly, the second stage is triggered, employing a fine-grained multi-class classification model. This stage uses CLIP for cross-modal contrastive learning with text and images, enhancing interpretability and achieving refined classification through specially designed triplet textual relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that TCVADS significantly outperforms existing methods in model performance, detection efficiency, and interpretability, offering valuable contributions to smart city monitoring applications.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing both visual and textual information. However, the critical challenge of alignment between visual and textual representations is not fully understood. This survey presents a comprehensive examination of alignment and misalignment in LVLMs through an explainability lens. We first examine the fundamentals of alignment, exploring its representational and behavioral aspects, training methodologies, and theoretical foundations. We then analyze misalignment phenomena across three semantic levels: object, attribute, and relational misalignment. Our investigation reveals that misalignment emerges from challenges at multiple levels: the data level, the model level, and the inference level. We provide a comprehensive review of existing mitigation strategies, categorizing them into parameter-frozen and parameter-tuning approaches. Finally, we outline promising future research directions, emphasizing the need for standardized evaluation protocols and in-depth explainability studies.

Abstract: The event-based Vision-Language Model (VLM) recently has made good progress for practical vision tasks. However, most of these works just utilize CLIP for focusing on traditional perception tasks, which obstruct model understanding explicitly the sufficient semantics and context from event streams. To address the deficiency, we propose EventVL, the first generative event-based MLLM (Multimodal Large Language Model) framework for explicit semantic understanding. Specifically, to bridge the data gap for connecting different modalities semantics, we first annotate a large event-image/video-text dataset, containing almost 1.4 million high-quality pairs of data, which enables effective learning across various scenes, e.g., drive scene or human motion. After that, we design Event Spatiotemporal Representation to fully explore the comprehensive information by diversely aggregating and segmenting the event stream. To further promote a compact semantic space, Dynamic Semantic Alignment is introduced to improve and complete sparse semantic spaces of events. Extensive experiments show that our EventVL can significantly surpass existing MLLM baselines in event captioning and scene description generation tasks. We hope our research could contribute to the development of the event vision community.

Abstract: Drone-view Geo-Localization (DVGL) aims to achieve accurate localization of drones by retrieving the most relevant GPS-tagged satellite images. However, most existing methods heavily rely on strictly pre-paired drone-satellite images for supervised learning. When the target region shifts, new paired samples are typically required to adapt to the distribution changes. The high cost of annotation and the limited transferability of these methods significantly hinder the practical deployment of DVGL in open-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end self-supervised learning method with a shallow backbone network, called the dynamic memory-driven and neighborhood information learning (DMNIL) method. It employs a clustering algorithm to generate pseudo-labels and adopts a dual-path contrastive learning framework to learn discriminative intra-view representations. Furthermore, DMNIL incorporates two core modules, including the dynamic hierarchical memory learning (DHML) module and the information consistency evolution learning (ICEL) module. The DHML module combines short-term and long-term memory to enhance intra-view feature consistency and discriminability. Meanwhile, the ICEL module utilizes a neighborhood-driven dynamic constraint mechanism to systematically capture implicit cross-view semantic correlations, consequently improving cross-view feature alignment. To further stabilize and strengthen the self-supervised training process, a pseudo-label enhancement strategy is introduced to enhance the quality of pseudo supervision. Extensive experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing self-supervised methods and even surpasses several state-of-the-art supervised methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/ISChenawei/DMNIL.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) in remote sensing images plays a vital role in Earth observation. However, the scarcity of high-resolution, comprehensive open-source datasets and the difficulty in achieving robust performance across varying change types remain major challenges. To address these issues, we introduce JL1-CD, a large-scale, sub-meter CD dataset consisting of 5,000 image pairs. We further propose a novel Origin-Partition (O-P) strategy and integrate it into a Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation (MTKD) framework to enhance CD performance. The O-P strategy partitions the training set by Change Area Ratio (CAR) and trains specialized teacher models on each subset. The MTKD framework then distills complementary knowledge from these teachers into a single student model, enabling improved detection results across diverse CAR scenarios without additional inference cost. Our MTKD approach demonstrated strong performance in the 2024 ``Jilin-1'' Cup challenge, ranking first in the preliminary and second in the final rounds. Extensive experiments on the JL1-CD and SYSU-CD datasets show that the MTKD framework consistently improves the performance of CD models with various network architectures and parameter sizes, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/circleLZY/MTKD-CD.

Abstract: Image anomaly detection plays a vital role in applications such as industrial quality inspection and medical imaging, where it directly contributes to improving product quality and system reliability. However, existing methods often struggle with complex and diverse anomaly patterns. In particular, the separation between generation and discrimination tasks limits the effective coordination between anomaly sample generation and anomaly region detection. To address these challenges, we propose a novel hybrid diffusion model (HDM) that integrates generation and discrimination into a unified framework. The model consists of three key modules: the Diffusion Anomaly Generation Module (DAGM), the Diffusion Discriminative Module (DDM), and the Probability Optimization Module (POM). DAGM generates realistic and diverse anomaly samples, improving their representativeness. DDM then applies a reverse diffusion process to capture the differences between generated and normal samples, enabling precise anomaly region detection and localization based on probability distributions. POM refines the probability distributions during both the generation and discrimination phases, ensuring high-quality samples are used for training. Extensive experiments on multiple industrial image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, significantly improving both image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection performance, as measured by AUROC.

Abstract: Evaluating creativity is challenging, even for humans, not only because of its subjectivity but also because it involves complex cognitive processes. Inspired by work in marketing, we attempt to break down visual advertisement creativity into atypicality and originality. With fine-grained human annotations on these dimensions, we propose a suite of tasks specifically for such a subjective problem. We also evaluate the alignment between state-of-the-art (SoTA) vision language models (VLMs) and humans on our proposed benchmark, demonstrating both the promises and challenges of using VLMs for automatic creativity assessment.

Abstract: Recent advances in video-based multimodal large language models (Video-LLMs) have significantly improved video understanding by processing videos as sequences of image frames. However, many existing methods treat frames independently in the vision backbone, lacking explicit temporal modeling, which limits their ability to capture dynamic patterns and efficiently handle long videos. To address these limitations, we introduce STORM (Spatiotemporal TOken Reduction for Multimodal LLMs), a novel architecture incorporating a dedicated temporal encoder between the image encoder and the LLM. Our temporal encoder leverages the Mamba State Space Model to integrate temporal information into image tokens, generating enriched representations that preserve inter-frame dynamics across the entire video sequence. This enriched encoding not only enhances video reasoning capabilities but also enables effective token reduction strategies, including test-time sampling and training-based temporal and spatial pooling, substantially reducing computational demands on the LLM without sacrificing key temporal information. By integrating these techniques, our approach simultaneously reduces training and inference latency while improving performance, enabling efficient and robust video understanding over extended temporal contexts. Extensive evaluations show that STORM achieves state-of-the-art results across various long video understanding benchmarks (more than 5% improvement on MLVU and LongVideoBench) while reducing the computation costs by up to $8\times$ and the decoding latency by 2.4-2.9$\times$ for the fixed numbers of input frames.

Abstract: While diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images from text prompts, they struggle with visual consistency when generating image sequences. Existing methods generate each image independently, leading to disjointed narratives - a challenge further exacerbated in non-linear storytelling, where scenes must connect beyond adjacent images. We introduce a novel beam search strategy for latent space exploration, enabling conditional generation of full image sequences with beam search decoding. In contrast to earlier methods that rely on fixed latent priors, our method dynamically samples past latents to search for an optimal sequence of latent representations, ensuring coherent visual transitions. As the latent denoising space is explored, the beam search graph is pruned with a cross-attention mechanism that efficiently scores search paths, prioritizing alignment with both textual prompts and visual context. Human and automatic evaluations confirm that BeamDiffusion outperforms other baseline methods, producing full sequences with superior coherence, visual continuity, and textual alignment.

Abstract: We present a system using Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to analyze a large database with tens of millions of images captured at different times, with the aim of discovering patterns in temporal changes. Specifically, we aim to capture frequent co-occurring changes ("trends") across a city over a certain period. Unlike previous visual analyses, our analysis answers open-ended queries (e.g., "what are the frequent types of changes in the city?") without any predetermined target subjects or training labels. These properties cast prior learning-based or unsupervised visual analysis tools unsuitable. We identify MLLMs as a novel tool for their open-ended semantic understanding capabilities. Yet, our datasets are four orders of magnitude too large for an MLLM to ingest as context. So we introduce a bottom-up procedure that decomposes the massive visual analysis problem into more tractable sub-problems. We carefully design MLLM-based solutions to each sub-problem. During experiments and ablation studies with our system, we find it significantly outperforms baselines and is able to discover interesting trends from images captured in large cities (e.g., "addition of outdoor dining,", "overpass was painted blue," etc.).

Abstract: Despite recent progress in diffusion models, generating realistic head portraits from novel viewpoints remains a significant challenge. Most current approaches are constrained to limited angular ranges, predominantly focusing on frontal or near-frontal views. Moreover, although the recent emerging large-scale diffusion models have been proven robust in handling 3D scenes, they underperform on facial data, given their complex structure and the uncanny valley pitfalls. In this paper, we propose SpinMeRound, a diffusion-based approach designed to generate consistent and accurate head portraits from novel viewpoints. By leveraging a number of input views alongside an identity embedding, our method effectively synthesizes diverse viewpoints of a subject whilst robustly maintaining its unique identity features. Through experimentation, we showcase our model's generation capabilities in 360 head synthesis, while beating current state-of-the-art multiview diffusion models.

Abstract: Wheat accounts for approximately 20% of the world's caloric intake, making it a vital component of global food security. Given this importance, mapping wheat fields plays a crucial role in enabling various stakeholders, including policy makers, researchers, and agricultural organizations, to make informed decisions regarding food security, supply chain management, and resource allocation. In this paper, we tackle the problem of accurately mapping wheat fields out of satellite images by introducing an improved pipeline for winter wheat segmentation, as well as presenting a case study on a decade-long analysis of wheat mapping in Lebanon. We integrate a Temporal Spatial Vision Transformer (TSViT) with Parameter-Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) and a novel post-processing pipeline based on the Fields of The World (FTW) framework. Our proposed pipeline addresses key challenges encountered in existing approaches, such as the clustering of small agricultural parcels in a single large field. By merging wheat segmentation with precise field boundary extraction, our method produces geometrically coherent and semantically rich maps that enable us to perform in-depth analysis such as tracking crop rotation pattern over years. Extensive evaluations demonstrate improved boundary delineation and field-level precision, establishing the potential of the proposed framework in operational agricultural monitoring and historical trend analysis. By allowing for accurate mapping of wheat fields, this work lays the foundation for a range of critical studies and future advances, including crop monitoring and yield estimation.

Abstract: Pain is a manifold condition that impacts a significant percentage of the population. Accurate and reliable pain evaluation for the people suffering is crucial to developing effective and advanced pain management protocols. Automatic pain assessment systems provide continuous monitoring and support decision-making processes, ultimately aiming to alleviate distress and prevent functionality decline. This study introduces PainFormer, a vision foundation model based on multi-task learning principles trained simultaneously on 14 tasks/datasets with a total of 10.9 million samples. Functioning as an embedding extractor for various input modalities, the foundation model provides feature representations to the Embedding-Mixer, a transformer-based module that performs the final pain assessment. Extensive experiments employing behavioral modalities - including RGB, synthetic thermal, and estimated depth videos - and physiological modalities such as ECG, EMG, GSR, and fNIRS revealed that PainFormer effectively extracts high-quality embeddings from diverse input modalities. The proposed framework is evaluated on two pain datasets, BioVid and AI4Pain, and directly compared to 75 different methodologies documented in the literature. Experiments conducted in unimodal and multimodal settings demonstrate state-of-the-art performances across modalities and pave the way toward general-purpose models for automatic pain assessment. The foundation model's architecture (code) and weights are available at: https://github.com/GkikasStefanos/PainFormer.

Abstract: Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment categories that are not annotated during training. While fine-tuning vision-language models has achieved promising results, these models often overfit to seen categories due to the lack of supervision for unseen classes. As an alternative to fully supervised approaches, query-based segmentation has shown great latent in ZSS, as it enables object localization without relying on explicit labels. However, conventional Hungarian matching, a core component in query-based frameworks, needs full supervision and often misclassifies unseen categories as background in the setting of ZSS. To address this issue, we propose Split Matching (SM), a novel assignment strategy that decouples Hungarian matching into two components: one for seen classes in annotated regions and another for latent classes in unannotated regions (referred to as unseen candidates). Specifically, we partition the queries into seen and candidate groups, enabling each to be optimized independently according to its available supervision. To discover unseen candidates, we cluster CLIP dense features to generate pseudo masks and extract region-level embeddings using CLS tokens. Matching is then conducted separately for the two groups based on both class-level similarity and mask-level consistency. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Feature Enhancement (MFE) module that refines decoder features through residual multi-scale aggregation, improving the model's ability to capture spatial details across resolutions. SM is the first to introduce decoupled Hungarian matching under the inductive ZSS setting, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard benchmarks.

Abstract: BEV-based 3D perception has emerged as a focal point of research in end-to-end autonomous driving. However, existing BEV approaches encounter significant challenges due to the large feature space, complicating efficient modeling and hindering effective integration of global attention mechanisms. We propose a novel modeling strategy, called InstanceBEV, that synergistically combines the strengths of both map-centric approaches and object-centric approaches. Our method effectively extracts instance-level features within the BEV features, facilitating the implementation of global attention modeling in a highly compressed feature space, thereby addressing the efficiency challenges inherent in map-centric global modeling. Furthermore, our approach enables effective multi-task learning without introducing additional module. We validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed model through predicting occupancy, achieving 3D occupancy panoptic segmentation by combining instance information. Experimental results on the OCC3D-nuScenes dataset demonstrate that InstanceBEV, utilizing only 8 frames, achieves a RayPQ of 15.3 and a RayIoU of 38.2. This surpasses SparseOcc's RayPQ by 9.3% and RayIoU by 10.7%, showcasing the effectiveness of multi-task synergy.

Abstract: Due to the unidirectional masking mechanism, Decoder-Only models propagate information from left to right. LVLMs (Large Vision-Language Models) follow the same architecture, with visual information gradually integrated into semantic representations during forward propagation. Through systematic analysis, we observe that the majority of the visual information is absorbed into the semantic representations. However, the model's attention distribution does not exhibit sufficient emphasis on semantic representations. This misalignment between the attention distribution and the actual information flow undermines the model's visual understanding ability and contributes to hallucinations. To address this issue, we enhance the model's visual understanding by leveraging the core information embedded in semantic representations. Specifically, we identify attention heads that focus on core semantic representations based on their attention distributions. Then, through a two-stage optimization paradigm, we propagate the advantages of these attention heads across the entire model, aligning the attention distribution with the actual information flow. We evaluate our method on three image captioning benchmarks using five different LVLMs, demonstrating its effectiveness in significantly reducing hallucinations. Further experiments reveal a trade-off between reduced hallucinations and richer details. Notably, our method allows for manual adjustment of the model's conservativeness, enabling flexible control to meet diverse real-world requirements.

Abstract: Existing detectors are often trained on biased datasets, leading to the possibility of overfitting on non-causal image attributes that are spuriously correlated with real/synthetic labels. While these biased features enhance performance on the training data, they result in substantial performance degradation when applied to unbiased datasets. One common solution is to perform dataset alignment through generative reconstruction, matching the semantic content between real and synthetic images. However, we revisit this approach and show that pixel-level alignment alone is insufficient. The reconstructed images still suffer from frequency-level misalignment, which can perpetuate spurious correlations. To illustrate, we observe that reconstruction models tend to restore the high-frequency details lost in real images (possibly due to JPEG compression), inadvertently creating a frequency-level misalignment, where synthetic images appear to have richer high-frequency content than real ones. This misalignment leads to models associating high-frequency features with synthetic labels, further reinforcing biased cues. To resolve this, we propose Dual Data Alignment (DDA), which aligns both the pixel and frequency domains. Moreover, we introduce two new test sets: DDA-COCO, containing DDA-aligned synthetic images for testing detector performance on the most aligned dataset, and EvalGEN, featuring the latest generative models for assessing detectors under new generative architectures such as visual auto-regressive generators. Finally, our extensive evaluations demonstrate that a detector trained exclusively on DDA-aligned MSCOCO could improve across 8 diverse benchmarks by a non-trivial margin, showing a +7.2% on in-the-wild benchmarks, highlighting the improved generalizability of unbiased detectors. Our code is available at: https://github.com/roy-ch/Dual-Data-Alignment.

Abstract: Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content have led to highly realistic synthetic videos, particularly in human-centric scenarios involving speech, gestures, and full-body motion, posing serious threats to information authenticity and public trust. Unlike DeepFake techniques that focus on localized facial manipulation, human-centric video generation methods can synthesize entire human bodies with controllable movements, enabling complex interactions with environments, objects, and even other people. However, existing detection methods largely overlook the growing risks posed by such full-body synthetic content. Meanwhile, a growing body of research has explored leveraging LLMs for interpretable fake detection, aiming to explain decisions in natural language. Yet these approaches heavily depend on supervised fine-tuning, which introduces limitations such as annotation bias, hallucinated supervision, and weakened generalization. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, a novel multimodal human-centric synthetic video detection framework that eliminates the need for dense textual supervision by adopting Group Relative Policy Optimization, enabling LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities from simple binary labels. Our architecture combines a discrete vision tower for high-level semantic inconsistencies and a residual extractor for fine-grained artifact analysis. We further introduce FakeHumanVid, a large-scale benchmark containing 15K real and synthetic videos across nine state-of-the-art human generation methods driven by text, pose, or audio. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AvatarShield outperforms existing methods in both in-domain and cross-domain settings.

Abstract: Many decision-making tasks, where both accuracy and efficiency matter, still require human supervision. For example, tasks like traffic officers reviewing hour-long dashcam footage or researchers screening conference videos can benefit from concise summaries that reduce cognitive load and save time. Yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often produce verbose, redundant outputs that hinder task performance. Existing video caption evaluation depends on costly human annotations and overlooks the summaries' utility in downstream tasks. We address these gaps with Video-to-text Information Bottleneck Evaluation (VIBE), an annotation-free method that scores VLM outputs using two metrics: grounding (how well the summary aligns with visual content) and utility (how informative it is for the task). VIBE selects from randomly sampled VLM outputs by ranking them according to the two scores to support effective human decision-making. Human studies on LearningPaper24, SUTD-TrafficQA, and LongVideoBench show that summaries selected by VIBE consistently improve performance-boosting task accuracy by up to 61.23% and reducing response time by 75.77% compared to naive VLM summaries or raw video.

Abstract: Finding correspondences between semantically similar points across images and object instances is one of the everlasting challenges in computer vision. While large pre-trained vision models have recently been demonstrated as effective priors for semantic matching, they still suffer from ambiguities for symmetric objects or repeated object parts. We propose improving semantic correspondence estimation through 3D-aware pseudo-labeling. Specifically, we train an adapter to refine off-the-shelf features using pseudo-labels obtained via 3D-aware chaining, filtering wrong labels through relaxed cyclic consistency, and 3D spherical prototype mapping constraints. While reducing the need for dataset-specific annotations compared to prior work, we establish a new state-of-the-art on SPair-71k, achieving an absolute gain of over 4% and of over 7% compared to methods with similar supervision requirements. The generality of our proposed approach simplifies the extension of training to other data sources, which we demonstrate in our experiments.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for radiance field rendering, but it typically requires millions of redundant Gaussian primitives, overwhelming memory and rendering budgets. Existing compaction approaches address this by pruning Gaussians based on heuristic importance scores, without global fidelity guarantee. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel optimal transport perspective that casts 3DGS compaction as global Gaussian mixture reduction. Specifically, we first minimize the composite transport divergence over a KD- tree partition to produce a compact geometric representation, and then decouple appearance from geometry by fine-tuning color and opacity attributes with far fewer Gaussian primitives. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method (i) yields negligible loss in rendering quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) compared to vanilla 3DGS with only 10% Gaussians; and (ii) consistently outperforms state- of-the-art 3DGS compaction techniques. Notably, our method is applicable to any stage of vanilla or accelerated 3DGS pipelines, providing an efficient and agnostic pathway to lightweight neural rendering.

Abstract: Human-machine interaction, particularly in prosthetic and robotic control, has seen progress with gesture recognition via surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals.However, classifying similar gestures that produce nearly identical muscle signals remains a challenge, often reducing classification accuracy. Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612 dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment with a 6.75 ms inference latency.

Abstract: Today, Earth Observation (EO) satellites generate massive volumes of data. To fully exploit this, it is essential to pretrain EO Foundation Models (FMs) on large unlabeled datasets, enabling efficient fine-tuning for downstream tasks with minimal labeled data. In this paper, we study scaling-up FMs: we train our models on the pretraining dataset MajorTOM 23TB which includes all regions, and the performance on average is competitive versus models pretrained on more specialized datasets which are substantially smaller and include only land. The additional data of oceans and ice do not decrease the performance on land-focused downstream tasks. These results indicate that large FMs trained on global datasets for a wider variety of downstream tasks can be useful for downstream applications that only require a subset of the information included in their training. The second contribution is the exploration of U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Vision Transformers (ViT), and Mamba State-Space Models (SSM) as FMs. U-Net captures local correlations amongst pixels, while ViT and Mamba capture local and distant correlations. We develop various models using different architectures, including U-Net, ViT, and Mamba, and different number of parameters. We evaluate the FLoating-point OPerations (FLOPs) needed by the models. We fine-tune on the PhilEO Bench for different downstream tasks: roads, buildings, and land cover. For most n-shots for roads and buildings, U-Net 200M-2T outperforms the other models. Using Mamba, we achieve comparable results on the downstream tasks, with less computational expenses. We also compare with the recent FM TerraMind which we evaluate on PhilEO Bench.

Abstract: To be adopted in safety-critical domains like medical image analysis, AI systems must provide human-interpretable decisions. Variational Information Pursuit (V-IP) offers an interpretable-by-design framework by sequentially querying input images for human-understandable concepts, using their presence or absence to make predictions. However, existing V-IP methods overlook sample-specific uncertainty in concept predictions, which can arise from ambiguous features or model limitations, leading to suboptimal query selection and reduced robustness. In this paper, we propose an interpretable and uncertainty-aware framework for medical imaging that addresses these limitations by accounting for upstream uncertainties in concept-based, interpretable-by-design models. Specifically, we introduce two uncertainty-aware models, EUAV-IP and IUAV-IP, that integrate uncertainty estimates into the V-IP querying process to prioritize more reliable concepts per sample. EUAV-IP skips uncertain concepts via masking, while IUAV-IP incorporates uncertainty into query selection implicitly for more informed and clinically aligned decisions. Our approach allows models to make reliable decisions based on a subset of concepts tailored to each individual sample, without human intervention, while maintaining overall interpretability. We evaluate our methods on five medical imaging datasets across four modalities: dermoscopy, X-ray, ultrasound, and blood cell imaging. The proposed IUAV-IP model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among interpretable-by-design approaches on four of the five datasets, and generates more concise explanations by selecting fewer yet more informative concepts. These advances enable more reliable and clinically meaningful outcomes, enhancing model trustworthiness and supporting safer AI deployment in healthcare.

Abstract: A common assumption in probabilistic generative models for image generation is that learning the global data distribution suffices to generate novel images via sampling. We investigate the limitation of this core assumption, namely that learning global distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability Space (MEPS) and the Local Dependence Hypothesis (LDH), for investigation. MEPS arises from the observation that deterministic mappings (e.g. neural networks) involving random variables tend to reduce overlap coefficients among involved random variables, thereby inducing exclusivity. We further propose a lower bound in terms of the overlap coefficient, and introduce a Binary Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) that encodes images into signed binary latent representations. LDH formalizes dependence within a finite observation radius, which motivates our $\gamma$-Autoregressive Random Variable Model ($\gamma$-ARVM). $\gamma$-ARVM is an autoregressive model, with a variable observation range $\gamma$, that predicts a histogram for the next token. Using $\gamma$-ARVM, we observe that as the observation range increases, autoregressive models progressively shift toward memorization. In the limit of global dependence, the model behaves as a pure memorizer when operating on the binary latents produced by our BL-AE. Comprehensive experiments and discussions support our investigation.

Abstract: Surface defects are a primary source of yield loss in manufacturing, yet existing anomaly detection methods often fail in real-world deployment due to limited and unrepresentative datasets. To overcome this, we introduce 3D-ADAM, a 3D Anomaly Detection in Additive Manufacturing dataset, that is the first large-scale, industry-relevant dataset for RGB+3D surface defect detection in additive manufacturing. 3D-ADAM comprises 14,120 high-resolution scans of 217 unique parts, captured with four industrial depth sensors, and includes 27,346 annotated defects across 12 categories along with 27,346 annotations of machine element features in 16 classes. 3D-ADAM is captured in a real industrial environment and as such reflects real production conditions, including variations in part placement, sensor positioning, lighting, and partial occlusion. Benchmarking state-of-the-art models demonstrates that 3D-ADAM presents substantial challenges beyond existing datasets. Validation through expert labelling surveys with industry partners further confirms its industrial relevance. By providing this benchmark, 3D-ADAM establishes a foundation for advancing robust 3D anomaly detection capable of meeting manufacturing demands.

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents significant challenges in reconstructing high-quality novel views, as it often overfits to the widely-varying high-frequency (HF) details of the sparse training views. While frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.

Abstract: Feature-level fusion shows promise in collaborative perception (CP) through balanced performance and communication bandwidth trade-off. However, its effectiveness critically relies on input feature quality. The acquisition of high-quality features faces domain gaps from hardware diversity and deployment conditions, alongside temporal misalignment from transmission delays. These challenges degrade feature quality with cumulative effects throughout the collaborative network. In this paper, we present the Domain-And-Time Alignment (DATA) network, designed to systematically align features while maximizing their semantic representations for fusion. Specifically, we propose a Consistency-preserving Domain Alignment Module (CDAM) that reduces domain gaps through proximal-region hierarchical downsampling and observability-constrained discriminator. We further propose a Progressive Temporal Alignment Module (PTAM) to handle transmission delays via multi-scale motion modeling and two-stage compensation. Building upon the aligned features, an Instance-focused Feature Aggregation Module (IFAM) is developed to enhance semantic representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DATA achieves state-of-the-art performance on three typical datasets, maintaining robustness with severe communication delays and pose errors. The code will be released at https://github.com/ChengchangTian/DATA.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning. Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships. This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models. Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new, high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this direction.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical harmonics with lightweight, arbitrarily oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a 50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half. Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

Abstract: Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases -- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs. horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to human-like robustness.

Abstract: As large vision language models (VLMs) advance, their capabilities in multilingual visual question answering (mVQA) have significantly improved. Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been proven to enhance interpretability and complex reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on textual CoT and provide limited support for multilingual multimodal reasoning, constraining their deployment in real-world applications. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{LaV-CoT}, the first Language-aware Visual CoT framework with Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization. LaV-CoT incorporates an interpretable multi-stage reasoning pipeline consisting of Text Summary with Bounding Box (BBox), Language Identification, Spatial Object-level Captioning, and Step-by-step Logical Reasoning. Following this reasoning pipeline, we design an automated data curation method that generates multilingual CoT annotations through iterative generation, correction, and refinement, enabling scalable and high-quality training data. To improve reasoning and generalization, LaV-CoT adopts a two-stage training paradigm combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Language-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), guided by verifiable multi-aspect rewards including language consistency, structural accuracy, and semantic alignment. Extensive evaluations on public datasets including MMMB, Multilingual MMBench, and MTVQA show that LaV-CoT achieves up to ~9.5% accuracy improvements over open-source baselines of similar size and even surpasses models with 2$\times$ larger scales by ~2.6%. Moreover, LaV-CoT outperforms advanced proprietary models such as GPT-4o-0513 and Gemini-2.5-flash. We further conducted an online A/B test to validate our method on real-world data, highlighting its effectiveness for industrial deployment.

<title>Is Pre-training Truly Better Than Meta-Learning?</title>

Abstract: In the context of few-shot learning, it is currently believed that a fixed pre-trained (PT) model, along with fine-tuning the final layer during evaluation, outperforms standard meta-learning algorithms. We re-evaluate these claims under an in-depth empirical examination of an extensive set of formally diverse datasets and compare PT to Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Unlike previous work, we emphasize a fair comparison by using: the same architecture, the same optimizer, and all models trained to convergence. Crucially, we use a more rigorous statistical tool -- the effect size (Cohen's d) -- to determine the practical significance of the difference between a model trained with PT vs. a MAML. We then use a previously proposed metric -- the diversity coefficient -- to compute the average formal diversity of a dataset. Using this analysis, we demonstrate the following: 1. when the formal diversity of a data set is low, PT beats MAML on average and 2. when the formal diversity is high, MAML beats PT on average. The caveat is that the magnitude of the average difference between a PT vs. MAML using the effect size is low (according to classical statistical thresholds) -- less than 0.2. Nevertheless, this observation is contrary to the currently held belief that a pre-trained model is always better than a meta-learning model. Our extensive experiments consider 21 few-shot learning benchmarks, including the large-scale few-shot learning dataset Meta-Data set. We also show no significant difference between a MAML model vs. a PT model with GPT-2 on Openwebtext. We, therefore, conclude that a pre-trained model does not always beat a meta-learned model and that the formal diversity of a dataset is a driving factor.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a complex group of eye diseases marked by optic nerve damage, commonly linked to elevated intraocular pressure and biomarkers like retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Understanding how these biomarkers interact is crucial for unraveling glaucoma's underlying mechanisms. In this paper, we propose GlaLSTM, a novel concurrent LSTM stream framework for glaucoma detection, leveraging latent biomarker relationships. Unlike traditional CNN-based models that primarily detect glaucoma from images, GlaLSTM provides deeper interpretability, revealing the key contributing factors and enhancing model transparency. This approach not only improves detection accuracy but also empowers clinicians with actionable insights, facilitating more informed decision-making. Experimental evaluations confirm that GlaLSTM surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its potential for both advanced biomarker analysis and reliable glaucoma detection.

Abstract: Expanding the long-context capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models~(MLLMs) is critical for advancing video understanding and high-resolution image analysis. Achieving this requires systematic improvements in model architecture, data construction, and training strategies, particularly to address challenges such as performance degradation with increasing image counts and high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba and Transformer blocks, introduce data construction methods that capture both temporal and spatial dependencies, and employ a progressive training strategy. Our released model, LongLLaVA (\textbf{Long}-Context \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage \textbf{a}nd \textbf{V}ision \textbf{A}ssistant), demonstrates an effective balance between efficiency and performance. LongLLaVA achieves competitive results across various benchmarks while maintaining high throughput and low memory consumption. Notably, it can process nearly one thousand images on a single A100 80GB GPU, underscoring its potential for a wide range of multi-modal applications.

Abstract: Vision-language foundation models (VLMs), such as CLIP, exhibit remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models can be unreliable when significant distribution gaps exist between training and test data, while fine-tuning for diverse scenarios is often costly. Cache-based test-time adapters offer an efficient alternative by storing representative test samples to guide subsequent classifications. Yet, these methods typically employ naive cache management with limited capacity, leading to severe catastrophic forgetting when samples are inevitably dropped during updates. In this paper, we propose DOTA (DistributiOnal Test-time Adaptation), a simple yet effective method addressing this limitation. Crucially, instead of merely memorizing individual test samples, DOTA continuously estimates the underlying distribution of the test data stream. Test-time posterior probabilities are then computed using these dynamically estimated distributions via Bayes' theorem for adaptation. This distribution-centric approach enables the model to continually learn and adapt to the deployment environment. Extensive experiments validate that DOTA significantly mitigates forgetting and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a key technique for enhancing the capabilities and efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). The open-source community has driven model evolution by iteratively merging existing models, yet a principled understanding of the gains and underlying factors in model merging remains limited. In this work, we study model evolution through iterative merging, drawing an analogy to biological evolution, and introduce the concept of model kinship, the degree of similarity or relatedness between LLMs. Through comprehensive empirical analysis, we show that model kinship is closely linked to the performance improvements achieved by merging, providing a useful criterion for selecting candidate models. Building on this insight, we propose a new model merging strategy: Top-k Greedy Merging with Model Kinship, which can improve benchmark performance. Specifically, we discover that incorporating model kinship as a guiding criterion enables continuous merging while mitigating performance degradation caused by local optima, thereby facilitating more effective model evolution.

Abstract: Knowledge Editing (KE) enables the modification of outdated or incorrect information in large language models (LLMs). While existing KE methods can update isolated facts, they often fail to generalize these updates to multi-hop reasoning tasks that rely on the modified knowledge. Through an analysis of reasoning circuits -- the neural pathways LLMs use for knowledge-based inference, we find that current layer-localized KE approaches (e.g., MEMIT, WISE), which edit only single or a few model layers, inadequately integrate updated knowledge into these reasoning pathways. To address this limitation, we present CaKE (Circuit-aware Knowledge Editing), a novel method that enhances the effective integration of updated knowledge in LLMs. By only leveraging a few curated data samples guided by our circuit-based analysis, CaKE stimulates the model to develop appropriate reasoning circuits for newly incorporated knowledge. Experiments show that CaKE enables more accurate and consistent use of edited knowledge across related reasoning tasks, achieving an average improvement of 20% in multi-hop reasoning accuracy on the MQuAKE dataset while requiring less memory than existing KE methods. We release the code and data in https://github.com/zjunlp/CaKE.

Abstract: Fine-tuning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to specific domains, but often compromises their previously established safety alignment. To mitigate the degradation of model safety during fine-tuning, we introduce LookAhead Tuning, a lightweight and effective data-driven approach that preserves safety during fine-tuning. The method introduces two simple strategies that modify training data by previewing partial answer prefixes, thereby minimizing perturbations to the model's initial token distributions and maintaining its built-in safety mechanisms. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LookAhead Tuning effectively maintains model safety without sacrificing robust performance on downstream tasks. Our findings position LookAhead Tuning as a reliable and efficient solution for the safe and effective adaptation of LLMs.

<title>Disentangle and Regularize: Sign Language Production with Articulator-Based Disentanglement and Channel-Aware Regularization</title>

Abstract: In this work, we propose DARSLP, a simple gloss-free, transformer-based sign language production (SLP) framework that directly maps spoken-language text to sign pose sequences. We first train a pose autoencoder that encodes sign poses into a compact latent space using an articulator-based disentanglement strategy, where features corresponding to the face, right hand, left hand, and body are modeled separately to promote structured and interpretable representation learning. Next, a non-autoregressive transformer decoder is trained to predict these latent representations from word-level text embeddings of the input sentence. To guide this process, we apply channel-aware regularization by aligning predicted latent distributions with priors extracted from the ground-truth encodings using a KL divergence loss. The contribution of each channel to the loss is weighted according to its associated articulator region, enabling the model to account for the relative importance of different articulators during training. Our approach does not rely on gloss supervision or pretrained models, and achieves state-of-the-art results on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily datasets.

Abstract: This paper presents a fascinating find: By training an auto-regressive LLM model on text tokens, the text model inherently develops internally an ability to understand images and audio, thereby developing the ability to see and hear just by reading. Popular audio and visual LLM models fine-tune text LLM models to give text output conditioned on images and audio embeddings. On the other hand, our architecture takes in patches of images, audio waveforms or tokens as input. It gives us the embeddings or category labels typical of a classification pipeline. We show the generality of text weights in aiding audio classification for datasets FSD-50K and GTZAN. Further, we show this working for image classification on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, as well on image patches. This pushes the notion of text-LLMs learning powerful internal circuits that can be utilized by activating necessary connections for various applications rather than training models from scratch every single time.

<title>UltraBoneUDF: Self-supervised Bone Surface Reconstruction from Ultrasound Based on Neural Unsigned Distance Functions</title>

Abstract: Bone surface reconstruction is an essential component of computer-assisted orthopedic surgery (CAOS), forming the foundation for preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance. Compared to traditional imaging modalities such as CT and MRI, ultrasound provides a radiation-free, and cost-effective alternative. While ultrasound offers new opportunities in CAOS, technical shortcomings continue to hinder its translation into surgery. In particular, due to the inherent limitations of ultrasound imaging, B-mode ultrasound typically capture only partial bone surfaces, posing major challenges for surface reconstruction. Existing reconstruction methods struggle with such incomplete data, leading to increased reconstruction errors and artifacts. Effective techniques for accurately reconstructing open bone surfaces from real-world 3D ultrasound volumes remain lacking. We propose UltraBoneUDF, a self-supervised framework specifically designed for reconstructing open bone surfaces from ultrasound data using neural unsigned distance functions (UDFs). In addition, we present a novel loss function based on local tangent plane optimization that substantially improves surface reconstruction quality. UltraBoneUDF and competing models are benchmarked on three open-source datasets and further evaluated through ablation studies. Results: Qualitative results highlight the limitations of the state-of-the-art methods for open bone surface reconstruction and demonstrate the effectiveness of UltraBoneUDF. Quantitatively, UltraBoneUDF significantly outperforms competing methods across all evaluated datasets for both open and closed bone surface reconstruction in terms of mean Chamfer distance error: 0.96 mm on the UltraBones100k dataset (28.9% improvement compared to the state-of-the-art), 0.21 mm on the OpenBoneCT dataset (40.0% improvement), and 0.18 mm on the ClosedBoneCT dataset (63.3% improvement).

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art results in text-to-image, text-to-video generation, and editing. However, their large model size and the quadratic cost of spatial-temporal attention over multiple denoising steps make video generation computationally expensive. Static caching mitigates this by reusing features across fixed steps but fails to adapt to generation dynamics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and quality.
  We propose Foresight, an adaptive layer-reuse technique that reduces computational redundancy across denoising steps while preserving baseline performance. Foresight dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs for all layers across steps, adapting to generation parameters such as resolution and denoising schedules to optimize efficiency. Applied to OpenSora, Latte, and CogVideoX, Foresight achieves up to \latencyimprv end-to-end speedup, while maintaining video quality. The source code of Foresight is available at \href{https://github.com/STAR-Laboratory/foresight}{https://github.com/STAR-Laboratory/foresight}.

Abstract: Figure captions are crucial for helping readers understand and remember a figure's key message. Many models have been developed to generate these captions, helping authors compose better quality captions more easily. Yet, authors almost always need to revise generic AI-generated captions to match their writing style and the domain's style, highlighting the need for personalization. Despite language models' personalization (LaMP) advances, these technologies often focus on text-only settings and rarely address scenarios where both inputs and profiles are multimodal. This paper introduces LaMP-Cap, a dataset for personalized figure caption generation with multimodal figure profiles. For each target figure, LaMP-Cap provides not only the needed inputs, such as figure images, but also up to three other figures from the same document--each with its image, caption, and figure-mentioning paragraphs--as a profile to characterize the context. Experiments with four LLMs show that using profile information consistently helps generate captions closer to the original author-written ones. Ablation studies reveal that images in the profile are more helpful than figure-mentioning paragraphs, highlighting the advantage of using multimodal profiles over text-only ones.

Abstract: We present Athena-PRM, a multimodal process reward model (PRM) designed to evaluate the reward score for each step in solving complex reasoning problems. Developing high-performance PRMs typically demands significant time and financial investment, primarily due to the necessity for step-level annotations of reasoning steps. Conventional automated labeling methods, such as Monte Carlo estimation, often produce noisy labels and incur substantial computational costs. To efficiently generate high-quality process-labeled data, we propose leveraging prediction consistency between weak and strong completers as a criterion for identifying reliable process labels. Remarkably, Athena-PRM demonstrates outstanding effectiveness across various scenarios and benchmarks with just 5,000 samples. Furthermore, we also develop two effective strategies to improve the performance of PRMs: ORM initialization and up-sampling for negative data. We validate our approach in three specific scenarios: verification for test time scaling, direct evaluation of reasoning step correctness, and reward ranked fine-tuning. Our Athena-PRM consistently achieves superior performance across multiple benchmarks and scenarios. Notably, when using Qwen2.5-VL-7B as the policy model, Athena-PRM enhances performance by 10.2 points on WeMath and 7.1 points on MathVista for test time scaling. Furthermore, Athena-PRM sets the state-of-the-art (SoTA) results in VisualProcessBench and outperforms the previous SoTA by 3.9 F1-score, showcasing its robust capability to accurately assess the correctness of the reasoning step. Additionally, utilizing Athena-PRM as the reward model, we develop Athena-7B with reward ranked fine-tuning and outperforms baseline with a significant margin on five benchmarks.

Abstract: We present a data-domain sampling regime for quantifying CNNs' graphic perception behaviors. This regime lets us evaluate CNNs' ratio estimation ability in bar charts from three perspectives: sensitivity to training-test distribution discrepancies, stability to limited samples, and relative expertise to human observers. After analyzing 16 million trials from 800 CNNs models and 6,825 trials from 113 human participants, we arrived at a simple and actionable conclusion: CNNs can outperform humans and their biases simply depend on the training-test distance. We show evidence of this simple, elegant behavior of the machines when they interpret visualization images. osf.io/gfqc3 provides registration, the code for our sampling regime, and experimental results.

<title>Class-wise Balancing Data Replay for Federated Class-Incremental Learning</title>

Abstract: Federated Class Incremental Learning (FCIL) aims to collaboratively process continuously increasing incoming tasks across multiple clients. Among various approaches, data replay has become a promising solution, which can alleviate forgetting by reintroducing representative samples from previous tasks. However, their performance is typically limited by class imbalance, both within the replay buffer due to limited global awareness and between replayed and newly arrived classes. To address this issue, we propose a class wise balancing data replay method for FCIL (FedCBDR), which employs a global coordination mechanism for class-level memory construction and reweights the learning objective to alleviate the aforementioned imbalances. Specifically, FedCBDR has two key components: 1) the global-perspective data replay module reconstructs global representations of prior task in a privacy-preserving manner, which then guides a class-aware and importance-sensitive sampling strategy to achieve balanced replay; 2) Subsequently, to handle class imbalance across tasks, the task aware temperature scaling module adaptively adjusts the temperature of logits at both class and instance levels based on task dynamics, which reduces the model's overconfidence in majority classes while enhancing its sensitivity to minority classes. Experimental results verified that FedCBDR achieves balanced class-wise sampling under heterogeneous data distributions and improves generalization under task imbalance between earlier and recent tasks, yielding a 2%-15% Top-1 accuracy improvement over six state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Robust robotic task execution hinges on the reliable detection of execution failures in order to trigger safe operation modes, recovery strategies, or task replanning. However, many failure detection methods struggle to provide meaningful performance when applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that uses spatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs and task-relevant objects within the field of view. Both pieces of information are available in most robotic scenarios and can thus be readily obtained. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets that we amend, in part, with additional annotations of the aforementioned task-relevant knowledge. In light of the results, we also propose a data augmentation method that improves performance by applying variable frame rates to different parts of the video. We observe an improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 in F1 score on the ARMBench dataset without additional computational expense and an additional increase to 81.4 with test-time augmentation. The results emphasize the importance of spatio-temporal information during failure detection and suggest further investigation of suitable heuristics in future implementations. Code and annotations are available.

<div> self-supervised learning, shortcut learning, generative paradigm, discriminative methods, HyGDL 

Summary:
HyGDL addresses the issue of Shortcut Learning in Self-Supervised Learning by proposing a hybrid framework that achieves explicit content-style disentanglement. The framework operates on a single encoder and defines style as the component of a representation that is orthogonal to its style-invariant content. It follows the Invariance Pre-training Principle by systematically varying a bias at the input to force the model to learn an invariant essence. The approach involves a self-distillation objective to learn a stable, style-invariant content direction, an analytical projection to decompose the representation into orthogonal content and style vectors, and a style-conditioned reconstruction objective for end-to-end supervision. This principled disentanglement allows HyGDL to learn robust representations and demonstrate superior performance on benchmarks designed to diagnose shortcut learning. <div>
arXiv:2509.11598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), its generalization is fundamentally hindered by Shortcut Learning, where models exploit superficial features like texture instead of intrinsic structure. We experimentally verify this flaw within the generative paradigm (e.g., MAE) and argue it is a systemic issue also affecting discriminative methods, identifying it as the root cause of their failure on unseen domains. While existing methods often tackle this at a surface level by aligning or separating domain-specific features, they fail to alter the underlying learning mechanism that fosters shortcut dependency. To address this at its core, we propose HyGDL (Hybrid Generative-Discriminative Learning Framework), a hybrid framework that achieves explicit content-style disentanglement. Our approach is guided by the Invariance Pre-training Principle: forcing a model to learn an invariant essence by systematically varying a bias (e.g., style) at the input while keeping the supervision signal constant. HyGDL operates on a single encoder and analytically defines style as the component of a representation that is orthogonal to its style-invariant content, derived via vector projection. This is operationalized through a synergistic design: (1) a self-distillation objective learns a stable, style-invariant content direction; (2) an analytical projection then decomposes the representation into orthogonal content and style vectors; and (3) a style-conditioned reconstruction objective uses these vectors to restore the image, providing end-to-end supervision. Unlike prior methods that rely on implicit heuristics, this principled disentanglement allows HyGDL to learn truly robust representations, demonstrating superior performance on benchmarks designed to diagnose shortcut learning.

Summary:
Speculative decoding is a powerful acceleration technique for autoregressive large language models (LLMs), but implementing it in vision-language models (VLMs) presents challenges due to the dominance of visual tokens in the prefill stage. The SpecVLM system introduces an elastic visual compressor that dynamically selects compression techniques to balance efficiency and accuracy in VLM inference. It also proposes an online-logit distillation protocol that trains the model with on-the-fly teacher logits and features, improving efficiency without the need for offline distillation corpora. The training-time scaling effect is observed to increase the model's efficiency over time. Empirically, SpecVLM achieves significant speedup in inference while maintaining output distribution fidelity, showcasing its effectiveness across various resolutions and task complexities. The code for SpecVLM is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.11815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speculative decoding is a powerful way to accelerate autoregressive large language models (LLMs), but directly porting it to vision-language models (VLMs) faces unique systems constraints: the prefill stage is dominated by visual tokens whose count scales with image resolution and video length, inflating both compute and memory, especially the key-value (KV) cache. We study speculative decoding for VLMs and introduce SpecVLM, a practical system that (1) establishes a strong EAGLE-2-style baseline, EagleVLM, delivering 1.5--2.3x end-to-end speedups over full autoregressive inference, and (2) further accelerates VLM inference with an elastic visual compressor that adaptively selects among pruning, pooling, convolution, and resampler primitives to balance FLOPs/parameters and accuracy per input. To avoid costly offline distillation corpora, we propose an online-logit distillation protocol that trains the draft model with on-the-fly teacher logits and penultimate features using a combined cross-entropy and Smooth L1 objective, eliminating storage and preprocessing while remaining compute-efficient. This protocol reveals a training-time scaling effect: longer online training monotonically increases the draft model's average accepted length, improving speculative efficiency. Empirically, SpecVLM achieves additional acceleration, culminating in 2.5--2.9x end-to-end speedups within 5 epochs across LLaVA and MMMU, consistently over resolutions and task difficulties, while preserving the target model's output distribution (lossless decoding).

The article introduces LoFT, a framework for Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning (LTSSL) that extends the concept to foundation model fine-tuning. By fine-tuning foundation models, LoFT produces more reliable pseudo-labels, which enhances imbalanced learning.

Abstract: Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Among existing approaches, Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning (LTSSL) has emerged as an effective solution by incorporating a large amount of unlabeled data into the imbalanced labeled dataset. However, most prior LTSSL methods are designed to train models from scratch, which often leads to issues such as overconfidence and low-quality pseudo-labels. To address these challenges, we extend LTSSL into the foundation model fine-tuning paradigm and propose a novel framework: LoFT (Long-tailed semi-supervised learning via parameter-efficient Fine-Tuning). We demonstrate that fine-tuned foundation models can generate more reliable pseudolabels, thereby benefiting imbalanced learning. Furthermore, we explore a more practical setting by investigating semi-supervised learning under open-world conditions, where the unlabeled data may include out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. To handle this problem, we propose LoFT-OW (LoFT under Open-World scenarios) to improve the discriminative ability. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to previous approaches, even when utilizing only 1\% of the unlabeled data compared with previous works.

Summary: The article discusses the challenges faced by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in sparse-view settings, leading to undesirable artifacts and overfitting. The proposed solution, AD-GS, introduces an alternating densification framework that controls model capacity growth by alternating high and low densification phases. During high densification, the model aggressively densifies followed by photometric loss-based training to capture fine-grained scene details. In low densification, Gaussians are pruned for opacity and their geometry is refined through pseudo-view consistency and edge-aware depth smoothness. This approach significantly improves rendering quality and geometric consistency compared to existing methods, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on challenging datasets. The source code for AD-GS is available on the project page. <div>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown impressive results in real-time novel view synthesis. However, it often struggles under sparse-view settings, producing undesirable artifacts such as floaters, inaccurate geometry, and overfitting due to limited observations. We find that a key contributing factor is uncontrolled densification, where adding Gaussian primitives rapidly without guidance can harm geometry and cause artifacts. We propose AD-GS, a novel alternating densification framework that interleaves high and low densification phases. During high densification, the model densifies aggressively, followed by photometric loss based training to capture fine-grained scene details. Low densification then primarily involves aggressive opacity pruning of Gaussians followed by regularizing their geometry through pseudo-view consistency and edge-aware depth smoothness. This alternating approach helps reduce overfitting by carefully controlling model capacity growth while progressively refining the scene representation. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that AD-GS significantly improves rendering quality and geometric consistency compared to existing methods.

Summary:
Ensemble Learning was explored in the context of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for digitizing handwritten historical patient records with a high degree of accuracy needed, especially in the medical field. The study found that Ensemble Learning combined with OCR could improve accuracy levels. It also revealed that the size of the training data set did not have a significant impact on the accuracy improvement achieved by Ensemble Learning methods. The research was part of a bachelor project in Professor Lippert's research group in 2021. By leveraging Ensemble Learning techniques, the study aimed to add value to the process of digitizing and extracting valuable information from handwritten patient records. <div>

Abstract: For the bachelor project 2021 of Professor Lippert's research group, handwritten entries of historical patient records needed to be digitized using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) methods. Since the data will be used in the future, a high degree of accuracy is naturally required. Especially in the medical field this has even more importance. Ensemble Learning is a method that combines several machine learning models and is claimed to be able to achieve an increased accuracy for existing methods. For this reason, Ensemble Learning in combination with OCR is investigated in this work in order to create added value for the digitization of the patient records. It was possible to discover that ensemble learning can lead to an increased accuracy for OCR, which methods were able to achieve this and that the size of the training data set did not play a role here.

Abstract: Developing trustworthy intelligent vision systems for high-stakes domains, \emph{e.g.}, remote sensing and medical diagnosis, demands broad robustness without costly retraining. We propose \textbf{Visual Reasoning Agent (VRA)}, a training-free, agentic reasoning framework that wraps off-the-shelf vision-language models \emph{and} pure vision systems in a \emph{Think--Critique--Act} loop. While VRA incurs significant additional test-time computation, it achieves up to 40\% absolute accuracy gains on challenging visual reasoning benchmarks. Future work will optimize query routing and early stopping to reduce inference overhead while preserving reliability in vision tasks.

Summary:
ForestGen3D is a new generative modeling framework that uses aerial LiDAR data to synthesize high-fidelity 3D forest structures. It is based on conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models and trained on ALS/TLS data to reconstruct occluded sub-canopy detail. The model incorporates a geometric containment prior to ensure spatial consistency and ecological plausibility. Evaluation on mixed conifer ecosystems shows that ForestGen3D produces accurate reconstructions in terms of tree height, DBH, crown diameter, and volume. The containment property can serve as a quality proxy in the absence of TLS ground truth. This tool has implications for ecological modeling, wildfire simulation, and fuel characterization in environments where only ALS data is available.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3D structure of living and non-living components in ecosystems plays a critical role in determining ecological processes and feedbacks from both natural and human-driven disturbances. Anticipating the effects of wildfire, drought, disease, or atmospheric deposition depends on accurate characterization of 3D vegetation structure, yet widespread measurement remains prohibitively expensive and often infeasible. We introduce ForestGen3D, a novel generative modeling framework that synthesizes high-fidelity 3D forest structure using only aerial LiDAR (ALS) inputs. ForestGen3D is based on conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) trained on co-registered ALS/TLS (terrestrial LiDAR) data. The model learns to generate TLS-like 3D point clouds conditioned on sparse ALS observations, effectively reconstructing occluded sub-canopy detail at scale. To ensure ecological plausibility, we introduce a geometric containment prior based on the convex hull of ALS observations and provide theoretical and empirical guarantees that generated structures remain spatially consistent. We evaluate ForestGen3D at tree, plot, and landscape scales using real-world data from mixed conifer ecosystems, and show that it produces high-fidelity reconstructions that closely match TLS references in terms of geometric similarity and biophysical metrics, such as tree height, DBH, crown diameter and crown volume. Additionally, we demonstrate that the containment property can serve as a practical proxy for generation quality in settings where TLS ground truth is unavailable. Our results position ForestGen3D as a scalable tool for ecological modeling, wildfire simulation, and structural fuel characterization in ALS-only environments.

<div> NP-hard, Image data generation, Bin Packing problem, Resizable Anchored Region Packing, Heuristic algorithm
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel problem called Resizable Anchored Region Packing (RARP) in the context of image data generation, which involves placing objects in a scene canvas. The problem is conjectured to be NP-hard and a heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve it efficiently. The algorithm packs arbitrary-shaped regions at arbitrary locations in an image canvas iteratively using a greedy approach while meeting optimization constraints. The effectiveness of the algorithm is confirmed through the generation of a synthetic anomaly detection dataset with varying bin packing parameters. This algorithm has practical applications in generative modeling and synthetic data generation in computer vision, making it valuable for the imaging scientific community. <div>
arXiv:2509.16363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of image data generation in computer vision has traditionally been a harder problem to solve, than discriminative problems. Such data generation entails placing relevant objects of appropriate sizes each, at meaningful location in a scene canvas. There have been two classes of popular approaches to such generation: graphics based, and generative models-based. Optimization problems are known to lurk in the background for both these classes of approaches. In this paper, we introduce a novel, practically useful manifestation of the classical Bin Packing problem in the context of generation of synthetic image data. We conjecture that the newly introduced problem, Resizable Anchored Region Packing(RARP) Problem, is NP-hard, and provide detailed arguments about our conjecture. As a first solution, we present a novel heuristic algorithm that is generic enough and therefore scales and packs arbitrary number of arbitrary-shaped regions at arbitrary locations, into an image canvas. The algorithm follows greedy approach to iteratively pack region pairs in a careful way, while obeying the optimization constraints. The algorithm is validated by an implementation that was used to generate a large-scale synthetic anomaly detection dataset, with highly varying degree of bin packing parameters per image sample i.e. RARP instance. Visual inspection of such data and checking of the correctness of each solution proves the effectiveness of our algorithm. With generative modeling being on rise in deep learning, and synthetic data generation poised to become mainstream, we expect that the newly introduced problem will be valued in the imaging scientific community.

Summary:
- Developed a CAD system for accurate thyroid cancer classification focusing on feature extraction.
- Proposed a novel descriptor BPD-LDCT combining Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Improved Local Binary Pattern (ILBP) to capture textural features.
- Addressed challenges in thyroid ultrasound images due to complex anatomy and noisy textures.
- Achieved exceptional classification performance of nearly 100% for benign/malignant nodules and 99-100% for further sub-classification on two publicly available thyroid cancer datasets.
- Utilized non-linear SVM for final classification. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a new CAD system for accurate thyroid cancer classification with emphasis on feature extraction. Prior studies have shown that thyroid texture is important for segregating the thyroid ultrasound images into different classes. Based upon our experience with breast cancer classification, we first conjuncture that the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is the best descriptor for capturing textural features. Thyroid ultrasound images are particularly challenging as the gland is surrounded by multiple complex anatomical structures leading to variations in tissue density. Hence, we second conjuncture the importance of localization and propose that the Local DCT (LDCT) descriptor captures the textural features best in this context. Another disadvantage of complex anatomy around the thyroid gland is scattering of ultrasound waves resulting in noisy and unclear textures. Hence, we third conjuncture that one image descriptor is not enough to fully capture the textural features and propose the integration of another popular texture capturing descriptor (Improved Local Binary Pattern, ILBP) with LDCT. ILBP is known to be noise resilient as well. We term our novel descriptor as Binary Pattern Driven Local Discrete Cosine Transform (BPD-LDCT). Final classification is carried out using a non-linear SVM. The proposed CAD system is evaluated on the only two publicly available thyroid cancer datasets, namely TDID and AUITD. The evaluation is conducted in two stages. In Stage I, thyroid nodules are categorized as benign or malignant. In Stage II, the malignant cases are further sub-classified into TI-RADS (4) and TI-RADS (5). For Stage I classification, our proposed model demonstrates exceptional performance of nearly 100% on TDID and 97% on AUITD. In Stage II classification, the proposed model again attains excellent classification of close to 100% on TDID and 99% on AUITD.

Summary:<br />
This article introduces a new framework called StereoAdapter for underwater stereo depth estimation. The framework addresses the challenges of adapting large vision foundation encoders to the underwater domain and fusing monocular priors with stereo correspondences efficiently. StereoAdapter integrates a LoRA-adapted monocular foundation encoder with a recurrent stereo refinement module and employs dynamic LoRA adaptation for efficient rank selection. The framework is pre-trained on the synthetic UW-StereoDepth-40K dataset to enhance robustness under diverse underwater conditions. Evaluation on benchmarks like TartanAir and SQUID shows significant improvements compared to existing methods. Real-world deployment with the BlueROV2 robot further demonstrates the consistent robustness of the approach. The code and website for StereoAdapter are also made available for access and further research. <div>

Abstract: Underwater stereo depth estimation provides accurate 3D geometry for robotics tasks such as navigation, inspection, and mapping, offering metric depth from low-cost passive cameras while avoiding the scale ambiguity of monocular methods. However, existing approaches face two critical challenges: (i) parameter-efficiently adapting large vision foundation encoders to the underwater domain without extensive labeled data, and (ii) tightly fusing globally coherent but scale-ambiguous monocular priors with locally metric yet photometrically fragile stereo correspondences. To address these challenges, we propose StereoAdapter, a parameter-efficient self-supervised framework that integrates a LoRA-adapted monocular foundation encoder with a recurrent stereo refinement module. We further introduce dynamic LoRA adaptation for efficient rank selection and pre-training on the synthetic UW-StereoDepth-40K dataset to enhance robustness under diverse underwater conditions. Comprehensive evaluations on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show improvements of 6.11% on TartanAir and 5.12% on SQUID compared to state-of-the-art methods, while real-world deployment with the BlueROV2 robot further demonstrates the consistent robustness of our approach.

Summary:
Aha is a real-time highlight detection framework that predicts the relevance of video frames to a specific task described in natural language. It uses a multimodal vision-language model and decoupled heads trained on a large dataset of video labels. The Dynamic SinkCache mechanism ensures constant memory usage for infinite-length streams without compromising performance. Aha outperforms offline and full-context approaches on highlight detection benchmarks, achieving a mean Average Precision improvement of 5.9% on TVSum and 8.3% on Mr.Hisum. The framework shows potential for real-world robotics applications by facilitating real-time reasoning for downstream planning and long-horizon understanding. <div>
arXiv:2509.16421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time understanding of continuous video streams is essential for intelligent agents operating in high-stakes environments, including autonomous vehicles, surveillance drones, and disaster response robots. Yet, most existing video understanding and highlight detection methods assume access to the entire video during inference, making them unsuitable for online or streaming scenarios. In particular, current models optimize for offline summarization, failing to support step-by-step reasoning needed for real-time decision-making. We introduce Aha, an autoregressive highlight detection framework that predicts the relevance of each video frame against a task described in natural language. Without accessing future video frames, Aha utilizes a multimodal vision-language model and lightweight, decoupled heads trained on a large, curated dataset of human-centric video labels. To enable scalability, we introduce the Dynamic SinkCache mechanism that achieves constant memory usage across infinite-length streams without degrading performance on standard benchmarks. This encourages the hidden representation to capture high-level task objectives, enabling effective frame-level rankings for informativeness, relevance, and uncertainty with respect to the natural language task. Aha achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on highlight detection benchmarks, surpassing even prior offline, full-context approaches and video-language models by +5.9% on TVSum and +8.3% on Mr.Hisum in mAP (mean Average Precision). We explore Aha's potential for real-world robotics applications given a task-oriented natural language input and a continuous, robot-centric video. Both experiments demonstrate Aha's potential effectiveness as a real-time reasoning module for downstream planning and long-horizon understanding.

Summary:<br />
Recent advancements in radiance fields and novel view synthesis have enabled the creation of realistic digital twins from photographs. However, existing methods face challenges with flat, texture-less surfaces, resulting in uneven and semi-transparent reconstructions due to photometric reconstruction issues. To address this, a hybrid 2D/3D representation is proposed, optimizing planar Gaussians for flat surfaces and freeform Gaussians for the rest of the scene. This approach dynamically detects and refines planar regions, enhancing both visual fidelity and geometric accuracy. The method achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation on ScanNet++ and ScanNetv2, and excels in mesh extraction without overfitting to a specific camera model. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in producing high-quality reconstructions of indoor scenes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in radiance fields and novel view synthesis enable creation of realistic digital twins from photographs. However, current methods struggle with flat, texture-less surfaces, creating uneven and semi-transparent reconstructions, due to an ill-conditioned photometric reconstruction objective. Surface reconstruction methods solve this issue but sacrifice visual quality. We propose a novel hybrid 2D/3D representation that jointly optimizes constrained planar (2D) Gaussians for modeling flat surfaces and freeform (3D) Gaussians for the rest of the scene. Our end-to-end approach dynamically detects and refines planar regions, improving both visual fidelity and geometric accuracy. It achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation on ScanNet++ and ScanNetv2, and excels at mesh extraction without overfitting to a specific camera model, showing its effectiveness in producing high-quality reconstruction of indoor scenes.

Summary: 
This paper presents a novel white matter tractography method that utilizes Transformers to model the sequential nature of white matter streamlines and predict fiber directions by integrating trajectory context and diffusion MRI measurements. Additionally, CNNs are employed to extract microstructural features from local neighborhoods around each voxel for spatial information incorporation. The combination of these two approaches enhances the precision and completeness of neural pathway mapping, addressing challenges such as crossing, merging, and fanning white-matter configurations. The proposed method is evaluated using the Tractometer toolkit, demonstrating competitive performance against existing models, and showcases strong generalization to real-world data based on qualitative results from the TractoInferno dataset. <div>

Abstract: White matter tractography is an advanced neuroimaging technique that reconstructs the 3D white matter pathways of the brain from diffusion MRI data. It can be framed as a pathfinding problem aiming to infer neural fiber trajectories from noisy and ambiguous measurements, facing challenges such as crossing, merging, and fanning white-matter configurations. In this paper, we propose a novel tractography method that leverages Transformers to model the sequential nature of white matter streamlines, enabling the prediction of fiber directions by integrating both the trajectory context and current diffusion MRI measurements. To incorporate spatial information, we utilize CNNs that extract microstructural features from local neighborhoods around each voxel. By combining these complementary sources of information, our approach improves the precision and completeness of neural pathway mapping compared to traditional tractography models. We evaluate our method with the Tractometer toolkit, achieving competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches, and present qualitative results on the TractoInferno dataset, demonstrating strong generalization to real-world data.

<div> classification, MRI, missing modalities, multimodal, LiFS <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a multimodal MRI classification model designed to handle missing modalities in real-world clinical settings. It utilizes the mmFormer architecture with an adaptive module to address the issue of missing modalities, ensuring consistent lesion feature extraction across available modalities. A missing-modality compensation module is integrated to dynamically synthesize proxy features for recovering missing information using zero-padding, modality availability masks, and a Delta Function with learnable statistical parameters. The model also implements a cross-validation ensemble strategy by training multiple models on different folds and applying soft voting during inference. Evaluation on the CARE 2025 challenge for Liver Fibrosis Staging tasks shows promising results, with accuracies of 66.67% for Cirrhosis Detection and 74.17% for Substantial Fibrosis Detection on in-distribution vendors, along with corresponding AUC scores of 71.73% and 68.48%, respectively. <div>

Abstract: In real-world clinical settings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) frequently suffers from missing modalities due to equipment variability or patient cooperation issues, which can significantly affect model performance. To address this issue, we propose a multimodal MRI classification model based on the mmFormer architecture with an adaptive module for handling arbitrary combinations of missing modalities. Specifically, this model retains the hybrid modality-specific encoders and the modality-correlated encoder from mmFormer to extract consistent lesion features across available modalities. In addition, we integrate a missing-modality compensation module which leverages zero-padding, modality availability masks, and a Delta Function with learnable statistical parameters to dynamically synthesize proxy features for recovering missing information. To further improve prediction performance, we adopt a cross-validation ensemble strategy by training multiple models on different folds and applying soft voting during inference. This method is evaluated on the test set of Comprehensive Analysis & Computing of REal-world medical images (CARE) 2025 challenge, targeting the Liver Fibrosis Staging (LiFS) task based on non-contrast dynamic MRI scans including T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). For Cirrhosis Detection and Substantial Fibrosis Detection on in-distribution vendors, our model obtains accuracies of 66.67%, and 74.17%, and corresponding area under the curve (AUC) scores of 71.73% and 68.48%, respectively.

The study addresses the lack of Arabic benchmarks in video-to-text and text-to-video retrieval by introducing the AutoArabic framework. This framework utilizes large language models to translate English benchmarks into Modern Standard Arabic, reducing manual revision efforts significantly. An error detection module is incorporated to automatically flag potential translation errors with high accuracy. Applying the framework to the DiDeMo benchmark results in DiDeMo-AR, an Arabic variant with over 40,000 fluent Arabic descriptions. Analysis of translation errors is provided, categorized into a taxonomy to guide future efforts in Arabic localization. Training a baseline model on both Arabic and English benchmarks shows a moderate performance gap, indicating preserved benchmark difficulty in Arabic localization. Evaluating different post-editing budgets demonstrates performance improvement with increased post-editing, while even the raw LLM output remains usable. The code for the framework is made available for reproducibility in other languages on GitHub. <div>

Abstract: Video-to-text and text-to-video retrieval are dominated by English benchmarks (e.g. DiDeMo, MSR-VTT) and recent multilingual corpora (e.g. RUDDER), yet Arabic remains underserved, lacking localized evaluation metrics. We introduce a three-stage framework, AutoArabic, utilizing state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to translate non-Arabic benchmarks into Modern Standard Arabic, reducing the manual revision required by nearly fourfold. The framework incorporates an error detection module that automatically flags potential translation errors with 97% accuracy. Applying the framework to DiDeMo, a video retrieval benchmark produces DiDeMo-AR, an Arabic variant with 40,144 fluent Arabic descriptions. An analysis of the translation errors is provided and organized into an insightful taxonomy to guide future Arabic localization efforts. We train a CLIP-style baseline with identical hyperparameters on the Arabic and English variants of the benchmark, finding a moderate performance gap (about 3 percentage points at Recall@1), indicating that Arabic localization preserves benchmark difficulty. We evaluate three post-editing budgets (zero/ flagged-only/ full) and find that performance improves monotonically with more post-editing, while the raw LLM output (zero-budget) remains usable. To ensure reproducibility to other languages, we made the code available at https://github.com/Tahaalshatiri/AutoArabic.

Abstract: Accurate vision-based action recognition is crucial for developing autonomous robots that can operate safely and reliably in complex, real-world environments. In this work, we advance video-based recognition of indoor daily actions for robotic perception by leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) enriched with domain-specific knowledge. We adapt a prompt-learning framework in which class-level textual descriptions of each action are embedded as learnable prompts into a frozen pre-trained VLM backbone. Several strategies for structuring and encoding these textual descriptions are designed and evaluated. Experiments on the ETRI-Activity3D dataset demonstrate that our method, using only RGB video inputs at test time, achieves over 95\% accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the effectiveness of knowledge-augmented prompts in enabling robust action recognition with minimal supervision.

Abstract: Handwriting is significantly affected by neurological disorders (ND) such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prior works have analyzed handwriting tasks using feature-based approaches or computer-vision techniques, but these methods have struggled to generalize across multiple datasets, particularly between temporal features represented as time-series and images. We propose a framework that leverages both time-series and images of handwriting through a joint classifier, based on a ResNet50 pretrained on ImageNet-1k. Binary classification experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performances on existing time-series and image datasets, with significant improvement on specific drawing and writing tasks from the NeuroLogical Signals (NLS) dataset. In particular, the proposed model demonstrates improved performance on Draw Clock and Spiral tasks. Additionally, cross-dataset and multi-dataset experiments were consistently able to achieve high F1 scores, up to 98 for PD detection, highlighting the potential of the proposed model to generalize over different forms of handwriting signals, and enhance the detection of motor deficits in ND.

<div> Keywords: Vision-Language Models, GazeVLM, efficiency, human gaze, visual question answering

Summary:
GazeVLM is a training-free framework that leverages human eye gaze to improve the efficiency of Vision-Language Models. By using human gaze as a supervisory signal, GazeVLM identifies regions of interest in images and combines them with a low-resolution global view to optimize computation. This approach reduces visual tokens, total tokens, and FLOPs while maintaining answer quality. Evaluations on visual question answering tasks demonstrate that GazeVLM can significantly cut down on computational resources without sacrificing performance. By aligning model computation with human gaze, GazeVLM offers a straightforward solution for efficient inference on edge consumer devices like AR/VR devices. <div>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deliver impressive performance in understanding visual content with language instructions. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs, which hinders real-time use on edge consumer devices such as AR/VR devices. Existing efficiency methods commonly prune visual tokens using learned saliency, sparse attention schedules, or controller policies, but they often require architectural modification or access to intermediate activations. These pipelines add inference-time modules that increase compute and memory and often lead to an accuracy trade-off. Moreover, they also suffer from misalignment between the prompts and the region of interest in the images. Without human guidance, the model may focus on the wrong regions and miss small, high-frequency details when prompts or scenes change. In this paper, we propose GazeVLM, a training-free framework that uses the human eye gaze as a natural supervisory signal to allocate computation where it matters. By extracting gaze-driven regions of interest (ROIs) and optionally combining them with a low-resolution global view, GazeVLM mimics fovea-periphery perception to cut redundant visual tokens while preserving task-relevant details. We evaluate the visual question answering tasks on Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B on the VOILA-COCO benchmark with human gaze. Quality of the answer is assessed by GPT-4o pairwise judging and a weighted score over coverage, accuracy, details, and fluency. Efficiency is measured by token counts and FLOPs. GazeVLM reduces visual tokens by up to 93.1%, total tokens by up to 59.6%, and FLOPs by 50%, while keeping better answer quality relative to full-resolution baselines. Our results show that aligning model computation with human gaze offers a simple, plug-and-play path toward efficient VLM inference on consumer devices.

Abstract: Falls among seniors are a major public health issue. Existing solutions using wearable sensors, ambient sensors, and RGB-based vision systems face challenges in reliability, user compliance, and practicality. Studies indicate that stakeholders, such as older adults and eldercare facilities, prefer non-wearable, passive, privacy-preserving, and real-time fall detection systems that require no user interaction. This study proposes an advanced thermal fall detection method using a Bidirectional Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (BiConvLSTM) model, enhanced with spatial, temporal, feature, self, and general attention mechanisms. Through systematic experimentation across hundreds of model variations exploring the integration of attention mechanisms, recurrent modules, and motion flow, we identified top-performing architectures. Among them, BiConvLSTM achieved state-of-the-art performance with a ROC-AUC of $99.7\%$ on the TSF dataset and demonstrated robust results on TF-66, a newly emerged, diverse, and privacy-preserving benchmark. These results highlight the generalizability and practicality of the proposed model, setting new standards for thermal fall detection and paving the way toward deployable, high-performance solutions.

Summary:
The paper introduces a unified framework called Octree Latent Semantic Diffusion for 3D semantic scene completion, extension, and generation in indoor and outdoor settings. The framework operates on a dual octree graph latent representation, allowing efficient and memory-friendly processing. It disentangles the synthesis process into structure diffusion and latent semantic diffusion stages, enabling the generation of semantic embeddings for voxel-level semantic labels. The model can leverage partial LiDAR scans or maps at inference time for semantic scene completion or extension without requiring retraining. The results demonstrate high-quality structure, coherent semantics, and robust completion from single LiDAR scans, showcasing zero-shot generalization capability to out-of-distribution LiDAR data. This approach offers a practical and scalable alternative to traditional regression-based pipelines for real-world robotic perception tasks. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The completion, extension, and generation of 3D semantic scenes are an interrelated set of capabilities that are useful for robotic navigation and exploration. Existing approaches seek to decouple these problems and solve them oneoff. Additionally, these approaches are often domain-specific, requiring separate models for different data distributions, e.g. indoor vs. outdoor scenes. To unify these techniques and provide cross-domain compatibility, we develop a single framework that can perform scene completion, extension, and generation in both indoor and outdoor scenes, which we term Octree Latent Semantic Diffusion. Our approach operates directly on an efficient dual octree graph latent representation: a hierarchical, sparse, and memory-efficient occupancy structure. This technique disentangles synthesis into two stages: (i) structure diffusion, which predicts binary split signals to construct a coarse occupancy octree, and (ii) latent semantic diffusion, which generates semantic embeddings decoded by a graph VAE into voxellevel semantic labels. To perform semantic scene completion or extension, our model leverages inference-time latent inpainting, or outpainting respectively. These inference-time methods use partial LiDAR scans or maps to condition generation, without the need for retraining or finetuning. We demonstrate highquality structure, coherent semantics, and robust completion from single LiDAR scans, as well as zero-shot generalization to out-of-distribution LiDAR data. These results indicate that completion-through-generation in a dual octree graph latent space is a practical and scalable alternative to regression-based pipelines for real-world robotic perception tasks.

Abstract: Synthetic data is crucial for advancing autonomous driving (AD) systems, yet current state-of-the-art video generation models, despite their visual realism, suffer from subtle geometric distortions that limit their utility for downstream perception tasks. We identify and quantify this critical issue, demonstrating a significant performance gap in 3D object detection when using synthetic versus real data. To address this, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Geometric Feedback (RLGF), RLGF uniquely refines video diffusion models by incorporating rewards from specialized latent-space AD perception models. Its core components include an efficient Latent-Space Windowing Optimization technique for targeted feedback during diffusion, and a Hierarchical Geometric Reward (HGR) system providing multi-level rewards for point-line-plane alignment, and scene occupancy coherence. To quantify these distortions, we propose GeoScores. Applied to models like DiVE on nuScenes, RLGF substantially reduces geometric errors (e.g., VP error by 21\%, Depth error by 57\%) and dramatically improves 3D object detection mAP by 12.7\%, narrowing the gap to real-data performance. RLGF offers a plug-and-play solution for generating geometrically sound and reliable synthetic videos for AD development.

Summary:
CommonForms is a new web-scale dataset for form field detection, constructed from filtered Common Crawl PDFs with fillable elements. The dataset contains over 450k pages from 55k documents, showing diversity in languages and domains. Two form field detectors, FFDNet-Small and FFDNet-Large, achieve high precision on the test set at a low cost. High-resolution inputs are crucial for accurate detection, and data cleaning improves efficiency. The detectors outperform a popular commercial PDF reader by predicting checkboxes in addition to text and signature fields. This release marks the first large-scale dataset and open-source models for form field detection. The dataset, models, and code are available on GitHub for further research and development.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces CommonForms, a web-scale dataset for form field detection. It casts the problem of form field detection as object detection: given an image of a page, predict the location and type (Text Input, Choice Button, Signature) of form fields. The dataset is constructed by filtering Common Crawl to find PDFs that have fillable elements. Starting with 8 million documents, the filtering process is used to arrive at a final dataset of roughly 55k documents that have over 450k pages. Analysis shows that the dataset contains a diverse mixture of languages and domains; one third of the pages are non-English, and among the 14 classified domains, no domain makes up more than 25% of the dataset.
  In addition, this paper presents a family of form field detectors, FFDNet-Small and FFDNet-Large, which attain a very high average precision on the CommonForms test set. Each model cost less than $500 to train. Ablation results show that high-resolution inputs are crucial for high-quality form field detection, and that the cleaning process improves data efficiency over using all PDFs that have fillable fields in Common Crawl. A qualitative analysis shows that they outperform a popular, commercially available PDF reader that can prepare forms. Unlike the most popular commercially available solutions, FFDNet can predict checkboxes in addition to text and signature fields. This is, to our knowledge, the first large scale dataset released for form field detection, as well as the first open source models. The dataset, models, and code will be released at https://github.com/jbarrow/commonforms

Summary:
OS-DiffVSR is a novel one-step diffusion model for real-world Video Super-Resolution. It addresses the trade-off between video quality and inference efficiency by introducing an adjacent frame adversarial training paradigm, enhancing the quality of synthetic videos. Additionally, a multi-frame fusion mechanism is employed to preserve inter-frame temporal consistency and reduce flickering in videos. Experimental results on popular VSR benchmarks demonstrate that OS-DiffVSR surpasses existing diffusion-based VSR methods in quality, even outperforming those using multiple sampling steps. This approach shows promise in improving video super-resolution tasks by achieving high-quality results efficiently. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recently, latent diffusion models has demonstrated promising performance in real-world video super-resolution (VSR) task, which can reconstruct high-quality videos from distorted low-resolution input through multiple diffusion steps. Compared to image super-resolution (ISR), VSR methods needs to process each frame in a video, which poses challenges to its inference efficiency. However, video quality and inference efficiency have always been a trade-off for the diffusion-based VSR methods. In this work, we propose One-Step Diffusion model for real-world Video Super-Resolution, namely OS-DiffVSR. Specifically, we devise a novel adjacent frame adversarial training paradigm, which can significantly improve the quality of synthetic videos. Besides, we devise a multi-frame fusion mechanism to maintain inter-frame temporal consistency and reduce the flicker in video. Extensive experiments on several popular VSR benchmarks demonstrate that OS-DiffVSR can even achieve better quality than existing diffusion-based VSR methods that require dozens of sampling steps.

<div> adaptation, spectral compressive imaging, deep unfolding, self-supervised, test-time <br />
<br />Summary:
The paper introduces SlowFast-SCI, a dual-speed framework for spectral compressive imaging that combines slow cumulative learning with fast on-the-fly adaptation. Traditional deep unfolding methods for SCI focus on slow learning with heavy pre-training, leading to difficulties in handling new optical configurations. SlowFast-SCI bridges this gap by incorporating lightweight adaptation modules that can be trained self-supervised at test time. This framework achieves over 70% reduction in parameters and FLOPs, up to 5.79 dB PSNR improvement on out-of-distribution data, and a 4x faster adaptation speed. It maintains cross-domain adaptability and integrates with any deep-unfolding network, allowing for self-adaptive imaging and expanded computational imaging modalities. The code and models for SlowFast-SCI are available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. <div>
arXiv:2509.16509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans learn in two complementary ways: a slow, cumulative process that builds broad, general knowledge, and a fast, on-the-fly process that captures specific experiences. Existing deep-unfolding methods for spectral compressive imaging (SCI) mirror only the slow component-relying on heavy pre-training with many unfolding stages-yet they lack the rapid adaptation needed to handle new optical configurations. As a result, they falter on out-of-distribution cameras, especially in bespoke spectral setups unseen during training. This depth also incurs heavy computation and slow inference. To bridge this gap, we introduce SlowFast-SCI, a dual-speed framework seamlessly integrated into any deep unfolding network beyond SCI systems. During slow learning, we pre-train or reuse a priors-based backbone and distill it via imaging guidance into a compact fast-unfolding model. In the fast learning stage, lightweight adaptation modules are embedded within each block and trained self-supervised at test time via a dual-domain loss-without retraining the backbone. To the best of our knowledge, SlowFast-SCI is the first test-time adaptation-driven deep unfolding framework for efficient, self-adaptive spectral reconstruction. Its dual-stage design unites offline robustness with on-the-fly per-sample calibration-yielding over 70% reduction in parameters and FLOPs, up to 5.79 dB PSNR improvement on out-of-distribution data, preserved cross-domain adaptability, and a 4x faster adaptation speed. In addition, its modularity integrates with any deep-unfolding network, paving the way for self-adaptive, field-deployable imaging and expanded computational imaging modalities.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces the Seeing Culture Benchmark (SCB) to evaluate multimodal vision-language models' performance in cultural reasoning tasks. The SCB consists of 1,065 images capturing 138 cultural artifacts across five categories from Southeast Asia. The benchmark involves two stages: multiple-choice visual question answering and segmenting relevant cultural artifacts. Visual options are categorized based on their origin country. Results show the complexities of cross-modal cultural reasoning and the disparity between visual reasoning and spatial grounding in culturally rich scenarios. The SCB serves as a crucial benchmark for identifying shortcomings in current VLMs and guiding future developments in the field of cultural reasoning. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) have made substantial progress in various tasks that require a combined understanding of visual and textual content, particularly in cultural understanding tasks, with the emergence of new cultural datasets. However, these datasets frequently fall short of providing cultural reasoning while underrepresenting many cultures. In this paper, we introduce the Seeing Culture Benchmark (SCB), focusing on cultural reasoning with a novel approach that requires VLMs to reason on culturally rich images in two stages: i) selecting the correct visual option with multiple-choice visual question answering (VQA), and ii) segmenting the relevant cultural artifact as evidence of reasoning. Visual options in the first stage are systematically organized into three types: those originating from the same country, those from different countries, or a mixed group. Notably, all options are derived from a singular category for each type. Progression to the second stage occurs only after a correct visual option is chosen. The SCB benchmark comprises 1,065 images that capture 138 cultural artifacts across five categories from seven Southeast Asia countries, whose diverse cultures are often overlooked, accompanied by 3,178 questions, of which 1,093 are unique and meticulously curated by human annotators. Our evaluation of various VLMs reveals the complexities involved in cross-modal cultural reasoning and highlights the disparity between visual reasoning and spatial grounding in culturally nuanced scenarios. The SCB serves as a crucial benchmark for identifying these shortcomings, thereby guiding future developments in the field of cultural reasoning. https://github.com/buraksatar/SeeingCulture

Summary:
- Generating realistic videos with diffusion transformers requires significant computation, with attention layers as a bottleneck.
- Prior methods use block-sparse attention, skipping computations only when entire blocks of attention scores are zero.
- The proposed FG-Attn mechanism leverages fine-grained sparsity by skipping computations at the granularity of Mx1 slices of the attention map.
- An efficient bulk-load operation called asynchronous-gather load is developed to implement the sparse attention mechanism.
- Fine-grained sparse attention in video diffusion models achieves a speedup of 1.55X for 480p and 1.41X for 720p videos on a single H100 GPU.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating realistic videos with diffusion transformers demands significant computation, with attention layers the central bottleneck; even producing a short clip requires running a transformer over a very long sequence of embeddings, e.g., more than 30K embeddings for a 5-second video, incurring significant latency. Prior work aims to mitigate this bottleneck by exploiting sparsity in the attention layers to reduce computation. However, these works typically rely on block-sparse attention, which skips score computation only when all entries in a block of attention scores (corresponding to M queries and M keys, with M = 64 typically) are zero. This coarse-granular skipping of attention scores does not fully exploit sparsity in the attention map and leaves room for improvement. In this work, we propose FG-Attn, a sparse attention mechanism for long-context diffusion transformers that leverages sparsity at a fine granularity. Unlike block-sparse attention, which skips entire MxM blocks, our approach skips computations at the granularity of Mx1 slices of the attention map. Each slice is produced by query-key dot products between a block of query vectors and a single key. To implement our proposed sparse attention mechanism, we develop a new efficient bulk-load operation called asynchronous-gather load. This load operation gathers a sparse set of relevant key-value vectors from memory and arranges them into packed tiles in the GPU's shared memory. Only a sparse set of keys relevant to those queries are loaded into shared memory when computing attention for a block of queries, in contrast to loading full blocks of key tokens in block-sparse attention. Our fine-grained sparse attention, applied to video diffusion models, achieves an average 1.55X (up to 1.65X) speedup for 5 second, 480p videos, and an average 1.41X (up to 1.49X) for 5 second, 720p videos on a single H100 GPU.

Abstract: This work proposes the Lattice Boltzmann Model (LBM) to learn real-world pixel dynamicity for visual tracking. LBM decomposes visual representations into dynamic pixel lattices and solves pixel motion states through collision-streaming processes. Specifically, the high-dimensional distribution of the target pixels is acquired through a multilayer predict-update network to estimate the pixel positions and visibility. The predict stage formulates lattice collisions among the spatial neighborhood of target pixels and develops lattice streaming within the temporal visual context. The update stage rectifies the pixel distributions with online visual representations. Compared with existing methods, LBM demonstrates practical applicability in an online and real-time manner, which can efficiently adapt to real-world visual tracking tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of real-world point tracking benchmarks such as TAP-Vid and RoboTAP validate LBM's efficiency. A general evaluation of large-scale open-world object tracking benchmarks such as TAO, BFT, and OVT-B further demonstrates LBM's real-world practicality.

VC-Inspector introduces a reference-free evaluation framework for assessing the quality of video captions without relying on ground truth captions. The model utilizes large language models to generate pseudo captions of varying quality and trains a multimodal evaluator called Qwen2.5-VL. This approach focuses on factual grounding to ensure accurate assessment of caption quality, outperforming existing methods and aligning well with human judgments on the VATEX-Eval dataset. The performance of VC-Inspector also generalizes to image caption datasets by treating images as 1-frame videos. This innovative solution offers a scalable and generalizable method for evaluating the factual accuracy of video captions, enabling more effective and objective assessment in diverse video domains.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video captions offer concise snapshots of actors, objects, and actions within a video, serving as valuable assets for applications such as question answering and event localization. However, acquiring human annotations for video captions is costly or even impractical, especially when dealing with diverse video domains. Existing models trained on supervised datasets face challenges in evaluating performance across different domains due to the reliance on reference-based evaluation protocols, which necessitate ground truth captions. This assumption is unrealistic for evaluating videos in the wild. To address these limitations, we propose a reference-free evaluation framework that does not require ground truth captions, focusing on factual grounding to ensure accurate assessment of caption quality. We introduce VC-Inspector, a novel caption quality evaluator that is both reference-free and factually grounded. Utilizing large language models, we generate pseudo captions of varying quality based on supervised data, which are subsequently used to train a multimodal model (i.e., Qwen2.5-VL) as the evaluator. Our approach demonstrates superior alignment with human judgments on the VATEX-Eval dataset, outperforming existing methods. The performance also generalizes to image caption datasets, Flickr8K-Expert and Flickr8K-CF, when viewing images as 1-frame videos. Overall, VC-Inspector offers a scalable and generalizable solution for evaluating the factual accuracy of video captions, paving the way for more effective and objective assessment methodologies in diverse video domains.

Abstract: Image fusion is a fundamental and important task in computer vision, aiming to combine complementary information from different modalities to fuse images. In recent years, diffusion models have made significant developments in the field of image fusion. However, diffusion models often require complex computations and redundant inference time, which reduces the applicability of these methods. To address this issue, we propose RFfusion, an efficient one-step diffusion model for image fusion based on Rectified Flow. We incorporate Rectified Flow into the image fusion task to straighten the sampling path in the diffusion model, achieving one-step sampling without the need for additional training, while still maintaining high-quality fusion results. Furthermore, we propose a task-specific variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture tailored for image fusion, where the fusion operation is embedded within the latent space to further reduce computational complexity. To address the inherent discrepancy between conventional reconstruction-oriented VAE objectives and the requirements of image fusion, we introduce a two-stage training strategy. This approach facilitates the effective learning and integration of complementary information from multi-modal source images, thereby enabling the model to retain fine-grained structural details while significantly enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both inference speed and fusion quality.

<div> Keywords: 3D occupancy prediction, spatial-temporal modeling, Gaussian-based pipelines, multi-view spatial interaction, temporal consistency 

Summary: 
The paper introduces a Spatial-Temporal Gaussian Splatting (ST-GS) framework for improving 3D occupancy prediction in vision-centric autonomous driving. The framework enhances spatial and temporal modeling in existing Gaussian-based pipelines by incorporating a guidance-informed spatial aggregation strategy with a dual-mode attention mechanism. This strengthens spatial interaction in Gaussian representations. Additionally, a geometry-aware temporal fusion scheme is introduced to leverage historical context and improve temporal continuity in scene completion. Experimental results on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits superior temporal consistency compared to existing Gaussian-based methods. ST-GS not only enhances spatial modeling with improved multi-view spatial interaction but also enhances temporal modeling through effective multi-frame temporal consistency. It addresses limitations in current approaches and provides a comprehensive solution for 3D occupancy prediction in autonomous driving scenarios.

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is critical for comprehensive scene understanding in vision-centric autonomous driving. Recent advances have explored utilizing 3D semantic Gaussians to model occupancy while reducing computational overhead, but they remain constrained by insufficient multi-view spatial interaction and limited multi-frame temporal consistency. To overcome these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Gaussian Splatting (ST-GS) framework to enhance both spatial and temporal modeling in existing Gaussian-based pipelines. Specifically, we develop a guidance-informed spatial aggregation strategy within a dual-mode attention mechanism to strengthen spatial interaction in Gaussian representations. Furthermore, we introduce a geometry-aware temporal fusion scheme that effectively leverages historical context to improve temporal continuity in scene completion. Extensive experiments on the large-scale nuScenes occupancy prediction benchmark showcase that our proposed approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also delivers markedly better temporal consistency compared to existing Gaussian-based methods.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction Recognition (HOIR) and user identification play a crucial role in advancing augmented reality (AR)-based personalized assistive technologies. These systems are increasingly being deployed in high-stakes, human-centric environments such as aircraft cockpits, aerospace maintenance, and surgical procedures. This research introduces I2S (Interact2Sign), a multi stage framework designed for unobtrusive user identification through human object interaction recognition, leveraging 3D hand pose analysis in egocentric videos. I2S utilizes handcrafted features extracted from 3D hand poses and per forms sequential feature augmentation: first identifying the object class, followed by HOI recognition, and ultimately, user identification. A comprehensive feature extraction and description process was carried out for 3D hand poses, organizing the extracted features into semantically meaningful categories: Spatial, Frequency, Kinematic, Orientation, and a novel descriptor introduced in this work, the Inter-Hand Spatial Envelope (IHSE). Extensive ablation studies were conducted to determine the most effective combination of features. The optimal configuration achieved an impressive average F1-score of 97.52% for user identification, evaluated on a bimanual object manipulation dataset derived from the ARCTIC and H2O datasets. I2S demonstrates state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a lightweight model size of under 4 MB and a fast inference time of 0.1 seconds. These characteristics make the proposed framework highly suitable for real-time, on-device authentication in security-critical, AR-based systems.

<div> Keywords: text-video retrieval, multi-modal large language models, caption generation, retrieval relevance scores, Dual-Group Direct Preference Optimization

Summary:
In the field of text-video retrieval, the use of auxiliary captions is common to improve video understanding. However, current large language models often generate generic captions that are not suited for fine-grained retrieval tasks. Traditional captioning evaluation metrics also do not align with retrieval requirements. To address these challenges, the CaRe-DPO framework is introduced, which optimizes caption generation based on retrieval relevance scores. This framework utilizes the Dual-Group Direct Preference Optimization (DG-DPO) strategy to enhance captioning by modeling preferences across groups of video and caption pairs. Additionally, a role-embedding-based retrieval model is presented to differentiate between textual inputs with distinct roles. Experimental results demonstrate that CaRe-DPO effectively leverages auxiliary information to generate detailed captions, improving retrieval performance significantly. The code for this framework is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In text-video retrieval, auxiliary captions are often used to enhance video understanding, bridging the gap between the modalities. While recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot caption generation, we observe that such captions tend to be generic and indistinguishable across visually similar videos, limiting their utility for fine-grained retrieval. Moreover, conventional captioning approaches are typically evaluated using language generation metrics, such as BLEU, which are not typically tailored for retrieval tasks that require making discriminative distinctions between candidates. To address this, we propose $\textbf{CaRe-DPO}$, a retrieval framework that directly optimizes caption generation using retrieval relevance scores. At its core is Dual-Group Direct Preference Optimization (DG-DPO), a novel learning strategy that supervises captioning by modeling preferences across groups of distinct video and caption pairs. In addition, we present an MLLM-based retrieval model that incorporates role-embeddings to better distinguish between textual inputs with different functional roles, such as an auxiliary caption and a text query. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CaRe-DPO significantly enhances retrieval performance by effectively leveraging auxiliary knowledge to generate fine-grained captions for retrieval. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/CaReDPO.

Summary:<br /><br />Researchers introduce a new black-box counterfactual generation framework that focuses on generating human-level explanations without the need for training. The framework suggests optimal edits step-by-step by utilizing a pre-trained image editing diffusion model, ensuring explainable counterfactual generation. This approach does not require access to the classifier's internals, enhancing transparency in the process. By comparing the outputs of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Vision Transformer (ViT), and Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) classifiers with human reasoning, the researchers highlight the explanatory gap between neural model behavior and human understanding.

Abstract: Recent black-box counterfactual generation frameworks fail to take into account the semantic content of the proposed edits, while relying heavily on training to guide the generation process. We propose a novel, plug-and-play black-box counterfactual generation framework, which suggests step-by-step edits based on theoretical guarantees of optimal edits to produce human-level counterfactual explanations with zero training. Our framework utilizes a pre-trained image editing diffusion model, and operates without access to the internals of the classifier, leading to an explainable counterfactual generation process. Throughout our experimentation, we showcase the explanatory gap between human reasoning and neural model behavior by utilizing both Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Vision Transformer (ViT) and Large Vision Language Model (LVLM) classifiers, substantiated through a comprehensive human evaluation.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep generative models have emerged as a transformative tool in medical imaging, offering substantial potential for synthetic data generation. However, recent empirical studies highlight a critical vulnerability: these models can memorize sensitive training data, posing significant risks of unauthorized patient information disclosure. Detecting memorization in generative models remains particularly challenging, necessitating scalable methods capable of identifying training data leakage across large sets of generated samples. In this work, we propose DeepSSIM, a novel self-supervised metric for quantifying memorization in generative models. DeepSSIM is trained to: i) project images into a learned embedding space and ii) force the cosine similarity between embeddings to match the ground-truth SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) scores computed in the image space. To capture domain-specific anatomical features, training incorporates structure-preserving augmentations, allowing DeepSSIM to estimate similarity reliably without requiring precise spatial alignment. We evaluate DeepSSIM in a case study involving synthetic brain MRI data generated by a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) trained under memorization-prone conditions, using 2,195 MRI scans from two publicly available datasets (IXI and CoRR). Compared to state-of-the-art memorization metrics, DeepSSIM achieves superior performance, improving F1 scores by an average of +52.03% over the best existing method. Code and data of our approach are publicly available at the following link: https://github.com/brAIn-science/DeepSSIM.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces SQS, a query-based splatting pre-training method for Sparse Perception Models (SPMs) in autonomous driving. SQS predicts 3D Gaussian representations from sparse queries during pre-training, utilizing self-supervised splatting to learn fine-grained contextual features. The pre-trained Gaussian queries are integrated into downstream networks during fine-tuning through query interaction mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that SQS significantly improves performance in occupancy prediction and 3D object detection tasks, outperforming previous state-of-the-art pre-training methods. Specifically, SQS achieves a +1.3 mIoU improvement in occupancy prediction and a +1.0 NDS improvement in 3D object detection tasks on autonomous driving benchmarks. <div>

Abstract: Sparse Perception Models (SPMs) adopt a query-driven paradigm that forgoes explicit dense BEV or volumetric construction, enabling highly efficient computation and accelerated inference. In this paper, we introduce SQS, a novel query-based splatting pre-training specifically designed to advance SPMs in autonomous driving. SQS introduces a plug-in module that predicts 3D Gaussian representations from sparse queries during pre-training, leveraging self-supervised splatting to learn fine-grained contextual features through the reconstruction of multi-view images and depth maps. During fine-tuning, the pre-trained Gaussian queries are seamlessly integrated into downstream networks via query interaction mechanisms that explicitly connect pre-trained queries with task-specific queries, effectively accommodating the diverse requirements of occupancy prediction and 3D object detection. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that SQS delivers considerable performance gains across multiple query-based 3D perception tasks, notably in occupancy prediction and 3D object detection, outperforming prior state-of-the-art pre-training approaches by a significant margin (i.e., +1.3 mIoU on occupancy prediction and +1.0 NDS on 3D detection).

Summary:<br />
The study explores the challenge of detecting multi-step deepfakes that combine various manipulation methods. FakeChain, a benchmark dataset, is introduced to evaluate detection performance for 1-, 2-, and 3-step forgeries created using different generators. Detection models struggle when the final manipulation type differs from the training distribution, with a significant F1-score decrease. This suggests that detectors focus on last-stage artifacts rather than traces of previous manipulations, indicating a need for models to consider manipulation history and sequences. The findings underscore the importance of benchmarks like FakeChain in addressing the increasing complexity and diversity of deepfake synthesis in real-world scenarios.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-step or hybrid deepfakes, created by sequentially applying different deepfake creation methods such as Face-Swapping, GAN-based generation, and Diffusion methods, can pose an emerging and unforseen technical challenge for detection models trained on single-step forgeries. While prior studies have mainly focused on detecting isolated single manipulation, little is known about the detection model behavior under such compositional, hybrid, and complex manipulation pipelines. In this work, we introduce \textbf{FakeChain}, a large-scale benchmark comprising 1-, 2-, and 3-Step forgeries synthesized using five state-of-the-art representative generators. Using this approach, we analyze detection performance and spectral properties across hybrid manipulation at different step, along with varying generator combinations and quality settings. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that detection performance highly depends on the final manipulation type, with F1-score dropping by up to \textbf{58.83\%} when it differs from training distribution. This clearly demonstrates that detectors rely on last-stage artifacts rather than cumulative manipulation traces, limiting generalization. Such findings highlight the need for detection models to explicitly consider manipulation history and sequences. Our results highlight the importance of benchmarks such as FakeChain, reflecting growing synthesis complexity and diversity in real-world scenarios.

Summary: 
The article introduces the concept of vision-text fusion for accurately assessing image complexity, integrating visual and textual semantic features to enhance representational diversity. The D2S (Describe-to-Score) framework is proposed, which generates image captions using a pre-trained vision-language model. Utilizing feature alignment and entropy distribution alignment mechanisms, D2S guides semantic information for complexity assessment while bridging the gap between vision and text modalities.

Experimental results show that D2S outperforms existing methods on the IC9600 dataset and maintains competitiveness on the no-reference image quality assessment benchmark, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-modal fusion in complexity-related tasks. The code for the D2S framework is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans, cities require detailed air temperature data. However, predictive analytics methods based on conventional machine learning models and limited data infrastructure often provide inaccurate predictions, especially in underserved areas. In this context, geospatial foundation models trained on unstructured global data demonstrate strong generalization and require minimal fine-tuning, offering an alternative for predictions where traditional approaches are limited. This study fine-tunes a geospatial foundation model to predict urban land surface temperatures under future climate scenarios and explores its response to land cover changes using simulated vegetation strategies. The fine-tuned model achieved pixel-wise downscaling errors below 1.74 {\deg}C and aligned with ground truth patterns, demonstrating an extrapolation capacity up to 3.62 {\deg}C.

Abstract: In recent years, Visual Question Localized-Answering in robotic surgery (Surgical-VQLA) has gained significant attention for its potential to assist medical students and junior doctors in understanding surgical scenes. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided more promising solutions for this task. However, current methods struggle to establish complex dependencies between text and visual details, and have difficulty perceiving the spatial information of surgical scenes. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, Surgical-MambaLLM, which is the first to combine Mamba2 with LLM in the surgical domain, that leverages Mamba2's ability to effectively capture cross-modal dependencies and perceive spatial information in surgical scenes, thereby enhancing the LLMs' understanding of surgical images. Specifically, we propose the Cross-modal Bidirectional Mamba2 Integration (CBMI) module to leverage Mamba2 for effective multimodal fusion, with its cross-modal integration capabilities. Additionally, tailored to the geometric characteristics of surgical scenes, we design the Surgical Instrument Perception (SIP) scanning mode for Mamba2 to scan the surgical images, enhancing the model's spatial understanding of the surgical scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Surgical-MambaLLM model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the EndoVis17-VQLA and EndoVis18-VQLA datasets, significantly improving the performance of the Surgical-VQLA task.

Abstract: Skeleton-based gait emotion recognition has received significant attention due to its wide-ranging applications. However, existing methods primarily focus on extracting spatial and local temporal motion information, failing to capture long-range temporal representations. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CGTGait}, a novel framework that collaboratively integrates graph convolution and transformers to extract discriminative spatiotemporal features for gait emotion recognition. Specifically, CGTGait consists of multiple CGT blocks, where each block employs graph convolution to capture frame-level spatial topology and the transformer to model global temporal dependencies. Additionally, we introduce a Bidirectional Cross-Stream Fusion (BCSF) module to effectively aggregate posture and motion spatiotemporal features, facilitating the exchange of complementary information between the two streams. We evaluate our method on two widely used datasets, Emotion-Gait and ELMD, demonstrating that our CGTGait achieves state-of-the-art or at least competitive performance while reducing computational complexity by approximately \textbf{82.2\%} (only requiring 0.34G FLOPs) during testing.

Summary: 
The article introduces Follow-Your-Emoji-Faster, an efficient diffusion-based framework for freestyle portrait animation driven by facial landmarks. The framework addresses challenges such as preserving identity, accurate expression transfer, and maintaining long-term temporal consistency. To address these challenges, the model enhances Stable Diffusion with expression-aware landmarks and a fine-grained facial loss.

Abstract: We present Follow-Your-Emoji-Faster, an efficient diffusion-based framework for freestyle portrait animation driven by facial landmarks. The main challenges in this task are preserving the identity of the reference portrait, accurately transferring target expressions, and maintaining long-term temporal consistency while ensuring generation efficiency. To address identity preservation and accurate expression retargeting, we enhance Stable Diffusion with two key components: a expression-aware landmarks as explicit motion signals, which improve motion alignment, support exaggerated expressions, and reduce identity leakage; and a fine-grained facial loss that leverages both expression and facial masks to better capture subtle expressions and faithfully preserve the reference appearance. With these components, our model supports controllable and expressive animation across diverse portrait types, including real faces, cartoons, sculptures, and animals. However, diffusion-based frameworks typically struggle to efficiently generate long-term stable animation results, which remains a core challenge in this task. To address this, we propose a progressive generation strategy for stable long-term animation, and introduce a Taylor-interpolated cache, achieving a 2.6X lossless acceleration. These two strategies ensure that our method produces high-quality results efficiently, making it user-friendly and accessible. Finally, we introduce EmojiBench++, a more comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse portraits, driving videos, and landmark sequences. Extensive evaluations on EmojiBench++ demonstrate that Follow-Your-Emoji-Faster achieves superior performance in both animation quality and controllability. The code, training dataset and benchmark will be found in https://follow-your-emoji.github.io/.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel framework called DA-Font for few-shot font generation, aiming to create new fonts with limited glyph references. The framework integrates a Dual-Attention Hybrid Module (DAHM) comprising component attention blocks and relation attention blocks that work synergistically to guide the style transfer process and refine spatial relationships. Additionally, corner consistency loss and elastic mesh feature loss are used to improve geometric alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that DA-Font outperforms existing methods in terms of structural integrity and local fidelity across diverse font styles and characters.

Abstract: Few-shot font generation aims to create new fonts with a limited number of glyph references. It can be used to significantly reduce the labor cost of manual font design. However, due to the variety and complexity of font styles, the results generated by existing methods often suffer from visible defects, such as stroke errors, artifacts and blurriness. To address these issues, we propose DA-Font, a novel framework which integrates a Dual-Attention Hybrid Module (DAHM). Specifically, we introduce two synergistic attention blocks: the component attention block that leverages component information from content images to guide the style transfer process, and the relation attention block that further refines spatial relationships through interacting the content feature with both original and stylized component-wise representations. These two blocks collaborate to preserve accurate character shapes and stylistic textures. Moreover, we also design a corner consistency loss and an elastic mesh feature loss to better improve geometric alignment. Extensive experiments show that our DA-Font outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across diverse font styles and characters, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing structural integrity and local fidelity.

<div> Keywords: Vision-Language Models, Model Parity Aligner, Knowledge Transfer, Visual Question Answering, Efficiency 

Summary: 
The study introduces the Model Parity Aligner (MPA) framework to enhance Small Vision-Language Models (S-VLMs) by leveraging knowledge transfer from Large VLMs. MPA targets knowledge disparities between S-VLMs and L-VLMs using unlabeled images to improve efficiency in vision and language tasks. Experiments on four VQA benchmarks show consistent performance enhancements across specialized reasoning capabilities like text recognition and chart interpretation. MPA reduces the performance gap between S-VLMs and L-VLMs while maintaining computational efficiency. The approach offers a novel strategy for improving S-VLMs without requiring labeled training data. The code is publicly available for further research and experimentation.  

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (L-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various vision and language tasks, including visual question answering (VQA). However, their high computational cost makes them impractical for resource-constrained settings and inference-heavy applications. In contrast, Small Vision-Language Models (S-VLMs) offer efficiency but suffer from a significant performance gap compared to their larger counterparts. In this work, we introduce the Model Parity Aligner (MPA), a novel framework designed to systematically improve S-VLMs by leveraging unlabeled images and effective knowledge transfer from L-VLMs. Instead of traditional knowledge distillation methods that rely on labeled training data, MPA employs a strategic parity-based approach that precisely identifies the knowledge disparities between S-VLMs and L-VLMs, and optimizes training by targeting only these disparities. We conduct extensive experiments on four diverse VQA benchmarks, namely TextVQA, ST-VQA, ChartQA, and OKVQA, each of which requires specialized reasoning capabilities such as text recognition, chart interpretation, and commonsense and factual understanding. Our results demonstrate that MPA consistently enhances the performance of S-VLMs on all benchmarks, reducing the performance gap while maintaining computational efficiency. We make our code publicly available.

<div> Keywords: Person re-identification, Anytime ReID, Multi-scenario retrieval, Large-scale dataset, Uni-AT model

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new task called Anytime Person Re-identification (AT-ReID) to address the need for effective person retrieval in various scenarios based on time variations. A large-scale dataset, AT-USTC, containing 403k images of individuals with multiple clothing captured by RGB and IR cameras over 21 months, is introduced to facilitate research in AT-ReID. The proposed Uni-AT model includes a Multi-scenario ReID framework, Mixture-of-Attribute-Experts module, and Hierarchical Dynamic Weighting strategy to ensure balanced training across all scenarios and achieve satisfactory results. Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to generalize well across different scenarios. <div>

Abstract: In real applications, person re-identification (ReID) is expected to retrieve the target person at any time, including both daytime and nighttime, ranging from short-term to long-term. However, existing ReID tasks and datasets can not meet this requirement, as they are constrained by available time and only provide training and evaluation for specific scenarios. Therefore, we investigate a new task called Anytime Person Re-identification (AT-ReID), which aims to achieve effective retrieval in multiple scenarios based on variations in time. To address the AT-ReID problem, we collect the first large-scale dataset, AT-USTC, which contains 403k images of individuals wearing multiple clothes captured by RGB and IR cameras. Our data collection spans 21 months, and 270 volunteers were photographed on average 29.1 times across different dates or scenes, 4-15 times more than current datasets, providing conditions for follow-up investigations in AT-ReID. Further, to tackle the new challenge of multi-scenario retrieval, we propose a unified model named Uni-AT, which comprises a multi-scenario ReID (MS-ReID) framework for scenario-specific features learning, a Mixture-of-Attribute-Experts (MoAE) module to alleviate inter-scenario interference, and a Hierarchical Dynamic Weighting (HDW) strategy to ensure balanced training across all scenarios. Extensive experiments show that our model leads to satisfactory results and exhibits excellent generalization to all scenarios.

Abstract: Point cloud analysis has evolved with diverse network architectures, while existing works predominantly focus on introducing novel structural designs. However, conventional point-based architectures - processing raw points through sequential sampling, grouping, and feature extraction layers - demonstrate underutilized potential. We notice that substantial performance gains can be unlocked through strategic module integration rather than structural modifications. In this paper, we propose the Grouping-Feature Coordination Module (GF-Core), a lightweight separable component that simultaneously regulates both grouping layer and feature extraction layer to enable more nuanced feature aggregation. Besides, we introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy specifically tailored for point-based inputs to enhance model robustness in complex point cloud analysis scenarios. On ModelNet40 dataset, our method elevates baseline networks to 94.0% accuracy, matching advanced frameworks' performance while preserving architectural simplicity. On three variants of the ScanObjectNN dataset, we obtain improvements of 2.96%, 6.34%, and 6.32% respectively.

<div> Keywords: Vision-Language Models, Adversarial attacks, Embodied decision-making, safety threat, fine-grained control

Summary:
The paper introduces a new adversarial attack framework, ADVEDM, targeting Vision-Language Models (VLMs) used in embodied decision-making tasks. Current attacks on VLMs have limitations due to disrupting semantic information in images, causing misalignments with task prompts and resulting in invalid outputs. The ADVEDM framework aims to modify a few key objects in the VLM's perception while preserving other semantic regions, leading to valid but incorrect decisions. This approach poses a significant safety threat in the physical world as it influences agent actions. Two variants of the framework, ADVEDM-R and ADVEDM-A, respectively remove or add object semantics in images, demonstrating fine-grained control and effective attack performance in various scenarios and embodied decision-making tasks. <div>
arXiv:2509.16645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their strong reasoning and planning capabilities, are widely used in embodied decision-making (EDM) tasks in embodied agents, such as autonomous driving and robotic manipulation. Recent research has increasingly explored adversarial attacks on VLMs to reveal their vulnerabilities. However, these attacks either rely on overly strong assumptions, requiring full knowledge of the victim VLM, which is impractical for attacking VLM-based agents, or exhibit limited effectiveness. The latter stems from disrupting most semantic information in the image, which leads to a misalignment between the perception and the task context defined by system prompts. This inconsistency interrupts the VLM's reasoning process, resulting in invalid outputs that fail to affect interactions in the physical world. To this end, we propose a fine-grained adversarial attack framework, ADVEDM, which modifies the VLM's perception of only a few key objects while preserving the semantics of the remaining regions. This attack effectively reduces conflicts with the task context, making VLMs output valid but incorrect decisions and affecting the actions of agents, thus posing a more substantial safety threat in the physical world. We design two variants of based on this framework, ADVEDM-R and ADVEDM-A, which respectively remove the semantics of a specific object from the image and add the semantics of a new object into the image. The experimental results in both general scenarios and EDM tasks demonstrate fine-grained control and excellent attack performance.

Summary: 
This study evaluates the ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in understanding road topology for autonomous driving. The researchers project multi-view images into a unified ground-plane coordinate system and fuse them into bird's-eye-view lanes to formulate topology-related diagnostic tasks. While frontier closed-source models show high accuracy in some tasks, they struggle in others. Open-source VLMs, even at 30B scale, face significant challenges in spatial reasoning tasks. The study highlights that spatial reasoning remains a fundamental bottleneck for current VLMs. The model's performance is positively correlated with model size, length of reasoning tokens, and examples provided, suggesting a direction for future research. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress in multimodal reasoning, yet their applications in autonomous driving remain limited. In particular, the ability to understand road topology, a key requirement for safe navigation, has received relatively little attention. While some recent works have begun to explore VLMs in driving contexts, their performance on topology reasoning is far from satisfactory. In this work, we systematically evaluate VLMs' capabilities in road topology understanding. Specifically, multi-view images are projected into unified ground-plane coordinate system and fused into bird's-eye-view (BEV) lanes. Based on these BEV lanes, we formulate four topology-related diagnostic VQA tasks, which together capture essential components of spatial topology reasoning. Through extensive evaluation, we find that while frontier closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve relatively high accuracy in some tasks, they still fail in some temporal questions that humans can answer (e.g., GPT-4o achieve only 67.8% in vector, a two-class classification problem). Furthermore, we find open-source VLMs, even at 30B scale, struggle significantly. These results indicate that spatial reasoning remains a fundamental bottleneck for current VLMs. We also find that the model's capability is positively correlated with model size, length of reasoning tokens and shots provided as examples, showing direction for future research.

Summary:
In the article, a new approach called MedCutMix is proposed to address the challenges of data diversity and privacy concerns in Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) for radiology diagnosis. MedCutMix is a multi-modal data augmentation method that combines diagnostic sentence CutMix with cross-attention between text and images to improve semantic understanding. The approach outperforms existing methods across four radiology diagnosis datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing performance and generalizability in VLP tasks. By focusing on disease-centric augmentation within medical reports, MedCutMix provides a more nuanced and accurate representation of medical data, ultimately leading to improved results in radiology VLP tasks. <div>

Abstract: Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) is drawing increasing interest for its ability to minimize manual annotation requirements while enhancing semantic understanding in downstream tasks. However, its reliance on image-text datasets poses challenges due to privacy concerns and the high cost of obtaining paired annotations. Data augmentation emerges as a viable strategy to address this issue, yet existing methods often fall short of capturing the subtle and complex variations in medical data due to limited diversity. To this end, we propose MedCutMix, a novel multi-modal disease-centric data augmentation method. MedCutMix performs diagnostic sentence CutMix within medical reports and establishes the cross-attention between the diagnostic sentence and medical image to guide attentive manifold mix within the imaging modality. Our approach surpasses previous methods across four downstream radiology diagnosis datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing performance and generalizability in radiology VLP.

Summary: 
FitPro is a novel framework for Text-based Pedestrian Retrieval (TPR) that addresses challenges in open-world, interactive retrieval scenarios. It includes three key components: Feature Contrastive Decoding (FCD) for generating high-quality structured descriptions, Incremental Semantic Mining (ISM) for holistic pedestrian representation, and Query-aware Hierarchical Retrieval (QHR) for optimizing the retrieval pipeline based on query types. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, FitPro demonstrates superior generalization and semantic modeling capabilities compared to existing methods. The framework shows improved robustness against viewpoint shifts and fine-grained variations in descriptions, paving the way for practical deployment in real-world applications. The code and data for FitPro will be made available on GitHub for further research and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-based Pedestrian Retrieval (TPR) aims to retrieve specific target pedestrians in visual scenes according to natural language descriptions. Although existing methods have achieved progress under constrained settings, interactive retrieval in the open-world scenario still suffers from limited model generalization and insufficient semantic understanding. To address these challenges, we propose FitPro, an open-world interactive zero-shot TPR framework with enhanced semantic comprehension and cross-scene adaptability. FitPro has three innovative components: Feature Contrastive Decoding (FCD), Incremental Semantic Mining (ISM), and Query-aware Hierarchical Retrieval (QHR). The FCD integrates prompt-guided contrastive decoding to generate high-quality structured pedestrian descriptions from denoised images, effectively alleviating semantic drift in zero-shot scenarios. The ISM constructs holistic pedestrian representations from multi-view observations to achieve global semantic modeling in multi-turn interactions,thereby improving robustness against viewpoint shifts and fine-grained variations in descriptions. The QHR dynamically optimizes the retrieval pipeline according to query types, enabling efficient adaptation to multi-modal and multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments on five public datasets and two evaluation protocols demonstrate that FitPro significantly overcomes the generalization limitations and semantic modeling constraints of existing methods in interactive retrieval, paving the way for practical deployment. The code and data will be released at https://github.com/ lilo4096/FitPro-Interactive-Person-Retrieval.

<div> Keywords: embodied intelligence, action-based video object segmentation, label noise, learning strategies, benchmark

Summary:<br />
Embodied intelligence relies on accurately segmenting objects involved in interactions. This study focuses on action-based video object segmentation under label noise, considering textual prompt noise and mask annotation noise. The researchers introduce two types of label noise and establish a benchmark, ActiSeg-NL, for evaluating learning strategies to address this challenge. They analyze failure modes and robustness gains, attributing them to different noise types and foreground-background trade-offs. A Parallel Mask Head Mechanism (PMHM) is introduced to tackle mask annotation noise. Qualitative evaluations highlight boundary leakage and mislocalization under boundary perturbations, as well as occasional identity substitutions under textual flips. Different learning strategies show diverse robustness profiles, with some balancing performance across foreground and background, while others prioritize foreground accuracy. The benchmark and source code will be publicly available, aiding further research in this area. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.16677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied intelligence relies on accurately segmenting objects actively involved in interactions. Action-based video object segmentation addresses this by linking segmentation with action semantics, but it depends on large-scale annotations and prompts that are costly, inconsistent, and prone to multimodal noise such as imprecise masks and referential ambiguity. To date, this challenge remains unexplored. In this work, we take the first step by studying action-based video object segmentation under label noise, focusing on two sources: textual prompt noise (category flips and within-category noun substitutions) and mask annotation noise (perturbed object boundaries to mimic imprecise supervision). Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce two types of label noises for the action-based video object segmentation task. Second, we build up the first action-based video object segmentation under a label noise benchmark ActiSeg-NL and adapt six label-noise learning strategies to this setting, and establish protocols for evaluating them under textual, boundary, and mixed noise. Third, we provide a comprehensive analysis linking noise types to failure modes and robustness gains, and we introduce a Parallel Mask Head Mechanism (PMHM) to address mask annotation noise. Qualitative evaluations further reveal characteristic failure modes, including boundary leakage and mislocalization under boundary perturbations, as well as occasional identity substitutions under textual flips. Our comparative analysis reveals that different learning strategies exhibit distinct robustness profiles, governed by a foreground-background trade-off where some achieve balanced performance while others prioritize foreground accuracy at the cost of background precision. The established benchmark and source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/mylwx/ActiSeg-NL.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel framework called IPF-RDA to enhance the robustness of data augmentation techniques in deep learning models. It includes a class-discriminative information estimation algorithm to identify vulnerable points and importance scores, along with an information-preserving scheme to preserve critical information in augmented samples. Data augmentation methods are categorized and integrated into the framework to improve their robustness and unleash their full potential. Extensive experiments on various datasets show consistent performance improvements with popular deep learning models. The implementation code is available on GitHub. IPF-RDA simplifies the enhancement of data augmentation methods and showcases scalability and performance improvements across different datasets and deep learning models.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely utilized as an effective technique to enhance the generalization performance of deep models. However, data augmentation may inevitably introduce distribution shifts and noises, which significantly constrain the potential and deteriorate the performance of deep networks. To this end, we propose a novel information-preserving framework, namely IPF-RDA, to enhance the robustness of data augmentations in this paper. IPF-RDA combines the proposal of (i) a new class-discriminative information estimation algorithm that identifies the points most vulnerable to data augmentation operations and corresponding importance scores; And (ii) a new information-preserving scheme that preserves the critical information in the augmented samples and ensures the diversity of augmented data adaptively. We divide data augmentation methods into three categories according to the operation types and integrate these approaches into our framework accordingly. After being integrated into our framework, the robustness of data augmentation methods can be enhanced and their full potential can be unleashed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that although being simple, IPF-RDA consistently improves the performance of numerous commonly used state-of-the-art data augmentation methods with popular deep models on a variety of datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, CUHK03, Market1501, Oxford Flower, and MNIST, where its performance and scalability are stressed.

arXiv:2509.16680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is increasingly used in diverse applications ranging from general visual reasoning to safety-critical domains such as medical imaging and autonomous systems, where models must provide not only accurate answers but also explanations that humans can easily understand and verify. Prototype-based modeling has shown promise for interpretability by grounding predictions in semantically meaningful regions for purely visual reasoning tasks, yet remains underexplored in the context of VQA. We present ProtoVQA, a unified prototypical framework that (i) learns question-aware prototypes that serve as reasoning anchors, connecting answers to discriminative image regions, (ii) applies spatially constrained matching to ensure that the selected evidence is coherent and semantically relevant, and (iii) supports both answering and grounding tasks through a shared prototype backbone. To assess explanation quality, we propose the Visual-Linguistic Alignment Score (VLAS), which measures how well the model's attended regions align with ground-truth evidence. Experiments on Visual7W show that ProtoVQA yields faithful, fine-grained explanations while maintaining competitive accuracy, advancing the development of transparent and trustworthy VQA systems.

<title>Active View Selection for Scene-level Multi-view Crowd Counting and Localization with Limited Labels</title>

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting and localization fuse the input multi-views for estimating the crowd number or locations on the ground. Existing methods mainly focus on accurately predicting on the crowd shown in the input views, which neglects the problem of choosing the `best' camera views to perceive all crowds well in the scene. Besides, existing view selection methods require massive labeled views and images, and lack the ability for cross-scene settings, reducing their application scenarios. Thus, in this paper, we study the view selection issue for better scene-level multi-view crowd counting and localization results with cross-scene ability and limited label demand, instead of input-view-level results. We first propose an independent view selection method (IVS) that considers view and scene geometries in the view selection strategy and conducts the view selection, labeling, and downstream tasks independently. Based on IVS, we also put forward an active view selection method (AVS) that jointly optimizes the view selection, labeling, and downstream tasks. In AVS, we actively select the labeled views and consider both the view/scene geometries and the predictions of the downstream task models in the view selection process. Experiments on multi-view counting and localization tasks demonstrate the cross-scene and the limited label demand advantages of the proposed active view selection method (AVS), outperforming existing methods and with wider application scenarios.

Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medicine is remarkable, offering advanced diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities. However, the inherent opacity of complex AI models presents significant challenges to their clinical practicality. This paper focuses primarily on investigating the application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods, with the aim of making AI decisions transparent and interpretable. Our research focuses on implementing simulations using various medical datasets to elucidate the internal workings of the XAI model. These dataset-driven simulations demonstrate how XAI effectively interprets AI predictions, thus improving the decision-making process for healthcare professionals. In addition to a survey of the main XAI methods and simulations, ongoing challenges in the XAI field are discussed. The study highlights the need for the continuous development and exploration of XAI, particularly from the perspective of diverse medical datasets, to promote its adoption and effectiveness in the healthcare domain.

Abstract: In coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI), the captured measurement entangles spatial and spectral information, posing a severely ill-posed inverse problem for hyperspectral images (HSIs) reconstruction. Moreover, the captured radiance inherently depends on scene illumination, making it difficult to recover the intrinsic spectral reflectance that remains invariant to lighting conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a chromaticity-intensity decomposition framework, which disentangles an HSI into a spatially smooth intensity map and a spectrally variant chromaticity cube. The chromaticity encodes lighting-invariant reflectance, enriched with high-frequency spatial details and local spectral sparsity. Building on this decomposition, we develop CIDNet, a Chromaticity-Intensity Decomposition unfolding network within a dual-camera CASSI system. CIDNet integrates a hybrid spatial-spectral Transformer tailored to reconstruct fine-grained and sparse spectral chromaticity and a degradation-aware, spatially-adaptive noise estimation module that captures anisotropic noise across iterative stages. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world CASSI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in both spectral and chromaticity fidelity. Code and models will be publicly available.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images. Recent advancements in Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation have leveraged positional conditions and textual descriptions to facilitate precise and controllable image synthesis. Despite overall progress, current L2I methods still exhibit suboptimal performance. Therefore, we propose InstanceAssemble, a novel architecture that incorporates layout conditions via instance-assembling attention, enabling position control with bounding boxes (bbox) and multimodal content control including texts and additional visual content. Our method achieves flexible adaption to existing DiT-based T2I models through light-weighted LoRA modules. Additionally, we propose a Layout-to-Image benchmark, Denselayout, a comprehensive benchmark for layout-to-image generation, containing 5k images with 90k instances in total. We further introduce Layout Grounding Score (LGS), an interpretable evaluation metric to more precisely assess the accuracy of L2I generation. Experiments demonstrate that our InstanceAssemble method achieves state-of-the-art performance under complex layout conditions, while exhibiting strong compatibility with diverse style LoRA modules.

Abstract: Personalized animal image generation is challenging due to rich appearance cues and large morphological variability. Existing approaches often exhibit feature misalignment across domains, which leads to identity drift. We present AnimalBooth, a framework that strengthens identity preservation with an Animal Net and an adaptive attention module, mitigating cross domain alignment errors. We further introduce a frequency controlled feature integration module that applies Discrete Cosine Transform filtering in the latent space to guide the diffusion process, enabling a coarse to fine progression from global structure to detailed texture. To advance research in this area, we curate AnimalBench, a high resolution dataset for animal personalization. Extensive experiments show that AnimalBooth consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple benchmarks and improves both identity fidelity and perceptual quality.

<title>When Confidence Fails: Revisiting Pseudo-Label Selection in Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16704</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.16704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While significant advances exist in pseudo-label generation for semi-supervised semantic segmentation, pseudo-label selection remains understudied. Existing methods typically use fixed confidence thresholds to retain high-confidence predictions as pseudo-labels. However, these methods cannot cope with network overconfidence tendency, where correct and incorrect predictions overlap significantly in high-confidence regions, making separation challenging and amplifying model cognitive bias. Meanwhile, the direct discarding of low-confidence predictions disrupts spatial-semantic continuity, causing critical context loss. We propose Confidence Separable Learning (CSL) to address these limitations. CSL formulates pseudo-label selection as a convex optimization problem within the confidence distribution feature space, establishing sample-specific decision boundaries to distinguish reliable from unreliable predictions. Additionally, CSL introduces random masking of reliable pixels to guide the network in learning contextual relationships from low-reliability regions, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of discarding uncertain predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Pascal, Cityscapes, and COCO benchmarks show that CSL performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods. Code and model weights are available at https://github.com/PanLiuCSU/CSL.

<title>Text-Scene: A Scene-to-Language Parsing Framework for 3D Scene Understanding</title>

Abstract: Enabling agents to understand and interact with complex 3D scenes is a fundamental challenge for embodied artificial intelligence systems. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant progress in 2D image understanding, extending such capabilities to 3D scenes remains difficult: 1) 3D environment involves richer concepts such as spatial relationships, affordances, physics, layout, and so on, 2) the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language datasets has posed a significant obstacle. In this paper, we introduce Text-Scene, a framework that automatically parses 3D scenes into textual descriptions for scene understanding. Given a 3D scene, our model identifies object attributes and spatial relationships, and then generates a coherent summary of the whole scene, bridging the gap between 3D observation and language without requiring human-in-the-loop intervention. By leveraging both geometric analysis and MLLMs, Text-Scene produces descriptions that are accurate, detailed, and human-interpretable, capturing object-level details and global-level context. Experimental results on benchmarks demonstrate that our textual parses can faithfully represent 3D scenes and benefit downstream tasks. To evaluate the reasoning capability of MLLMs, we present InPlan3D, a comprehensive benchmark for 3D task planning, consisting of 3174 long-term planning tasks across 636 indoor scenes. We emphasize clarity and accessibility in our approach, aiming to make 3D scene content understandable through language. Code and datasets will be released.

<title>Pain in 3D: Generating Controllable Synthetic Faces for Automated Pain Assessment</title>

Abstract: Automated pain assessment from facial expressions is crucial for non-communicative patients, such as those with dementia. Progress has been limited by two challenges: (i) existing datasets exhibit severe demographic and label imbalance due to ethical constraints, and (ii) current generative models cannot precisely control facial action units (AUs), facial structure, or clinically validated pain levels.
  We present 3DPain, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for automated pain assessment, featuring unprecedented annotation richness and demographic diversity. Our three-stage framework generates diverse 3D meshes, textures them with diffusion models, and applies AU-driven face rigging to synthesize multi-view faces with paired neutral and pain images, AU configurations, PSPI scores, and the first dataset-level annotations of pain-region heatmaps. The dataset comprises 82,500 samples across 25,000 pain expression heatmaps and 2,500 synthetic identities balanced by age, gender, and ethnicity.
  We further introduce ViTPain, a Vision Transformer based cross-modal distillation framework in which a heatmap-trained teacher guides a student trained on RGB images, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and clinical reliability. Together, 3DPain and ViTPain establish a controllable, diverse, and clinically grounded foundation for generalizable automated pain assessment.

<title>Min: Mixture of Noise for Pre-Trained Model-Based Class-Incremental Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16738</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.16738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continuously learn new categories while retaining the knowledge of old ones. Pre-trained models (PTMs) show promising capabilities in CIL. However, existing approaches that apply lightweight fine-tuning to backbones still induce parameter drift, thereby compromising the generalization capability of pre-trained models. Parameter drift can be conceptualized as a form of noise that obscures critical patterns learned for previous tasks. However, recent researches have shown that noise is not always harmful. For example, the large number of visual patterns learned from pre-training can be easily abused by a single task, and introducing appropriate noise can suppress some low-correlation features, thus leaving a margin for future tasks. To this end, we propose learning beneficial noise for CIL guided by information theory and propose Mixture of Noise (Min), aiming to mitigate the degradation of backbone generalization from adapting new tasks. Specifically, task-specific noise is learned from high-dimension features of new tasks. Then, a set of weights is adjusted dynamically for optimal mixture of different task noise. Finally, Min embeds the beneficial noise into the intermediate features to mask the response of inefficient patterns. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that Min achieves state-of-the-art performance in most incremental settings, with particularly outstanding results in 50-steps incremental settings. This shows the significant potential for beneficial noise in continual learning.

arXiv:2509.16745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual explanations are often plausible but not structurally faithful. We introduce CAMBench-QR, a structure-aware benchmark that leverages the canonical geometry of QR codes (finder patterns, timing lines, module grid) to test whether CAM methods place saliency on requisite substructures while avoiding background. CAMBench-QR synthesizes QR/non-QR data with exact masks and controlled distortions, and reports structure-aware metrics (Finder/Timing Mass Ratios, Background Leakage, coverage AUCs, Distance-to-Structure) alongside causal occlusion, insertion/deletion faithfulness, robustness, and latency. We benchmark representative, efficient CAMs (LayerCAM, EigenGrad-CAM, XGrad-CAM) under two practical regimes of zero-shot and last-block fine-tuning. The benchmark, metrics, and training recipes provide a simple, reproducible yardstick for structure-aware evaluation of visual explanations. Hence we propose that CAMBENCH-QR can be used as a litmus test of whether visual explanations are truly structure-aware.

<title>HyPlaneHead: Rethinking Tri-plane-like Representations in Full-Head Image Synthesis</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16748</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.16748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tri-plane-like representations have been widely adopted in 3D-aware GANs for head image synthesis and other 3D object/scene modeling tasks due to their efficiency. However, querying features via Cartesian coordinate projection often leads to feature entanglement, which results in mirroring artifacts. A recent work, SphereHead, attempted to address this issue by introducing spherical tri-planes based on a spherical coordinate system. While it successfully mitigates feature entanglement, SphereHead suffers from uneven mapping between the square feature maps and the spherical planes, leading to inefficient feature map utilization during rendering and difficulties in generating fine image details. Moreover, both tri-plane and spherical tri-plane representations share a subtle yet persistent issue: feature penetration across convolutional channels can cause interference between planes, particularly when one plane dominates the others. These challenges collectively prevent tri-plane-based methods from reaching their full potential. In this paper, we systematically analyze these problems for the first time and propose innovative solutions to address them. Specifically, we introduce a novel hybrid-plane (hy-plane for short) representation that combines the strengths of both planar and spherical planes while avoiding their respective drawbacks. We further enhance the spherical plane by replacing the conventional theta-phi warping with a novel near-equal-area warping strategy, which maximizes the effective utilization of the square feature map. In addition, our generator synthesizes a single-channel unified feature map instead of multiple feature maps in separate channels, thereby effectively eliminating feature penetration. With a series of technical improvements, our hy-plane representation enables our method, HyPlaneHead, to achieve state-of-the-art performance in full-head image synthesis.

<title>DiffEye: Diffusion-Based Continuous Eye-Tracking Data Generation Conditioned on Natural Images</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16767</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.16767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous models have been developed for scanpath and saliency prediction, which are typically trained on scanpaths, which model eye movement as a sequence of discrete fixation points connected by saccades, while the rich information contained in the raw trajectories is often discarded. Moreover, most existing approaches fail to capture the variability observed among human subjects viewing the same image. They generally predict a single scanpath of fixed, pre-defined length, which conflicts with the inherent diversity and stochastic nature of real-world visual attention. To address these challenges, we propose DiffEye, a diffusion-based training framework designed to model continuous and diverse eye movement trajectories during free viewing of natural images. Our method builds on a diffusion model conditioned on visual stimuli and introduces a novel component, namely Corresponding Positional Embedding (CPE), which aligns spatial gaze information with the patch-based semantic features of the visual input. By leveraging raw eye-tracking trajectories rather than relying on scanpaths, DiffEye captures the inherent variability in human gaze behavior and generates high-quality, realistic eye movement patterns, despite being trained on a comparatively small dataset. The generated trajectories can also be converted into scanpaths and saliency maps, resulting in outputs that more accurately reflect the distribution of human visual attention. DiffEye is the first method to tackle this task on natural images using a diffusion model while fully leveraging the richness of raw eye-tracking data. Our extensive evaluation shows that DiffEye not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in scanpath generation but also enables, for the first time, the generation of continuous eye movement trajectories.

Abstract: Generative 3D modeling has advanced rapidly, driven by applications in VR/AR, metaverse, and robotics. However, most methods represent the target object as a closed mesh devoid of any structural information, limiting editing, animation, and semantic understanding. Part-aware 3D generation addresses this problem by decomposing objects into meaningful components, but existing pipelines face challenges: in existing methods, the user has no control over which objects are separated and how model imagine the occluded parts in isolation phase. In this paper, we introduce MMPart, an innovative framework for generating part-aware 3D models from a single image. We first use a VLM to generate a set of prompts based on the input image and user descriptions. In the next step, a generative model generates isolated images of each object based on the initial image and the previous step's prompts as supervisor (which control the pose and guide model how imagine previously occluded areas). Each of those images then enters the multi-view generation stage, where a number of consistent images from different views are generated. Finally, a reconstruction model converts each of these multi-view images into a 3D model.

Abstract: With the rapid increase in the number of artificial satellites, astronomical imaging is experiencing growing interference. When these satellites reflect sunlight, they produce streak-like artifacts in photometry images. Such satellite trails can introduce false sources and cause significant photometric errors. As a result, accurately identifying the positions of satellite trails in observational data has become essential. In this work, we propose a satellite trail detection model that combines the U-Net deep neural network for image segmentation with the Line Segment Detector (LSD) algorithm. The model is trained on 375 simulated images of satellite trails, generated using data from the Mini-SiTian Array. Experimental results show that for trails with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 3, the detection rate exceeds 99. Additionally, when applied to real observational data from the Mini-SiTian Array, the model achieves a recall of 79.57 and a precision of 74.56.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved strong performance on vision-language tasks, particularly Visual Question Answering (VQA). While prior work has explored unimodal biases in VQA, the problem of selection bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA), where models may favor specific option tokens (e.g., "A") or positions, remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate both the presence and nature of selection bias in LVLMs through fine-grained MCQA benchmarks spanning easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels, defined by the semantic similarity of the options. We further propose an inference-time logit-level debiasing method that estimates an ensemble bias vector from general and contextual prompts and applies confidence-adaptive corrections to the model's output. Our method mitigates bias without retraining and is compatible with frozen LVLMs. Extensive experiments across several state-of-the-art models reveal consistent selection biases that intensify with task difficulty, and show that our mitigation approach significantly reduces bias while improving accuracy in challenging settings. This work offers new insights into the limitations of LVLMs in MCQA and presents a practical approach to improve their robustness in fine-grained visual reasoning.

Abstract: Multi-modal three-dimensional (3D) medical imaging data, derived from ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and potentially computed tomography (CT), provide a widely adopted approach for non-invasive anatomical visualization. Accurate modeling, registration, and visualization in this setting depend on surface reconstruction and frame-to-frame interpolation. Traditional methods often face limitations due to image noise and incomplete information between frames. To address these challenges, we present MedGS, a semi-supervised neural implicit surface reconstruction framework that employs a Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based interpolation mechanism. In this framework, medical imaging data are represented as consecutive two-dimensional (2D) frames embedded in 3D space and modeled using Gaussian-based distributions. This representation enables robust frame interpolation and high-fidelity surface reconstruction across imaging modalities. As a result, MedGS offers more efficient training than traditional neural implicit methods. Its explicit GS-based representation enhances noise robustness, allows flexible editing, and supports precise modeling of complex anatomical structures with fewer artifacts. These features make MedGS highly suitable for scalable and practical applications in medical imaging.

<title>Looking in the mirror: A faithful counterfactual explanation method for interpreting deep image classification models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.16822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFE) for deep image classifiers aim to reveal how minimal input changes lead to different model decisions, providing critical insights for model interpretation and improvement. However, existing CFE methods often rely on additional image encoders and generative models to create plausible images, neglecting the classifier's own feature space and decision boundaries. As such, they do not explain the intrinsic feature space and decision boundaries learned by the classifier. To address this limitation, we propose Mirror-CFE, a novel method that generates faithful counterfactual explanations by operating directly in the classifier's feature space, treating decision boundaries as mirrors that ``reflect'' feature representations in the mirror. Mirror-CFE learns a mapping function from feature space to image space while preserving distance relationships, enabling smooth transitions between source images and their counterfactuals. Through extensive experiments on four image datasets, we demonstrate that Mirror-CFE achieves superior performance in validity while maintaining input resemblance compared to state-of-the-art explanation methods. Finally, mirror-CFE provides interpretable visualization of the classifier's decision process by generating step-wise transitions that reveal how features evolve as classification confidence changes.

Abstract: Accurate registration between LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point clouds and semantic 3D city models is a fundamental topic in urban digital twinning and a prerequisite for downstream tasks, such as digital construction, change detection and model refinement. However, achieving accurate LiDAR-to-Model registration at individual building level remains challenging, particularly due to the generalization uncertainty in semantic 3D city models at the Level of Detail 2 (LoD2). This paper addresses this gap by proposing L2M-Reg, a plane-based fine registration method that explicitly accounts for model uncertainty. L2M-Reg consists of three key steps: establishing reliable plane correspondence, building a pseudo-plane-constrained Gauss-Helmert model, and adaptively estimating vertical translation. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that L2M-Reg is both more accurate and computationally efficient than existing ICP-based and plane-based methods. Overall, L2M-Reg provides a novel building-level solution regarding LiDAR-to-Model registration when model uncertainty is present.

arXiv:2509.16853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prior studies in learned image compression (LIC) consistently show that only a small subset of latent channels is critical for reconstruction, while many others carry limited information. Exploiting this imbalance could improve both coding and computational efficiency, yet existing approaches often rely on costly, dataset-specific ablation tests and typically analyze channels in isolation, ignoring their interdependencies.
  We propose a generalizable, dataset-agnostic method to identify and organize important channels in pretrained VAE-based LIC models. Instead of brute-force empirical evaluations, our approach leverages intrinsic parameter statistics-weight variances, bias magnitudes, and pairwise correlations-to estimate channel importance. This analysis reveals a consistent organizational structure, termed the Invariant Salient Channel Space (ISCS), where Salient-Core channels capture dominant structures and Salient-Auxiliary channels provide complementary details. Building on ISCS, we introduce a deterministic channel ordering and grouping strategy that enables slice-parallel decoding, reduces redundancy, and improves bitrate efficiency.
  Experiments across multiple LIC architectures demonstrate that our method effectively reduces bitrate and computation while maintaining reconstruction quality, providing a practical and modular enhancement to existing learned compression frameworks.

Abstract: We introduce ConfidentSplat, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based SLAM system for robust, highfidelity RGB-only reconstruction. Addressing geometric inaccuracies in existing RGB-only 3DGS SLAM methods that stem from unreliable depth estimation, ConfidentSplat incorporates a core innovation: a confidence-weighted fusion mechanism. This mechanism adaptively integrates depth cues from multiview geometry with learned monocular priors (Omnidata ViT), dynamically weighting their contributions based on explicit reliability estimates-derived predominantly from multi-view geometric consistency-to generate high-fidelity proxy depth for map supervision. The resulting proxy depth guides the optimization of a deformable 3DGS map, which efficiently adapts online to maintain global consistency following pose updates from a DROID-SLAM-inspired frontend and backend optimizations (loop closure, global bundle adjustment). Extensive validation on standard benchmarks (TUM-RGBD, ScanNet) and diverse custom mobile datasets demonstrates significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy (L1 depth error) and novel view synthesis fidelity (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) over baselines, particularly in challenging conditions. ConfidentSplat underscores the efficacy of principled, confidence-aware sensor fusion for advancing state-of-the-art dense visual SLAM.

Abstract: The gaming and entertainment industry is rapidly evolving, driven by immersive experiences and the integration of generative AI (GAI) technologies. Training such models effectively requires large-scale datasets that capture the diversity and context of gaming environments. However, existing datasets are often limited to specific domains or rely on artificial degradations, which do not accurately capture the unique characteristics of gaming content. Moreover, benchmarks for controllable video generation remain absent.
  To address these limitations, we introduce $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$, a large-scale, multi-modal, multi-view dataset specifically designed to overcome the shortcomings of current resources. Unlike existing datasets, $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$ provides diverse, high-fidelity gaming content rendered with Unreal Engine 5, offering authentic ground-truth LR-HR paired and multi-view frames across 80 scenes in 8 categories. It includes $\mathtt{M^3VIR\_MR}$ for super-resolution (SR), novel view synthesis (NVS), and combined NVS+SR tasks, and $\mathtt{M^3VIR\_{MS}}$, the first multi-style, object-level ground-truth set enabling research on controlled video generation. Additionally, we benchmark several state-of-the-art SR and NVS methods to establish performance baselines. While no existing approaches directly handle controlled video generation, $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$ provides a benchmark for advancing this area. By releasing the dataset, we aim to facilitate research in AI-powered restoration, compression, and controllable content generation for next-generation cloud gaming and entertainment.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot segmentation ability on natural images but encounters difficulties in medical imaging due to domain shifts, anatomical variability, and its reliance on user-provided prompts. Recent prompt-free adaptations alleviate the need for expert intervention, yet still suffer from limited robustness and adaptability, often overlooking the issues of semantic over-smoothing and token uniformity. We propose SAM-DCE, which balances local discrimination and global semantics while mitigating token uniformity, enhancing inter-class separability, and enriching mask decoding with fine-grained, consistent representations. Extensive experiments on diverse medical benchmarks validate its effectiveness.

Abstract: As an essential vision task, infrared small target detection (IRSTD) has seen significant advancements through deep learning. However, critical limitations in current evaluation protocols impede further progress. First, existing methods rely on fragmented pixel- and target-level specific metrics, which fails to provide a comprehensive view of model capabilities. Second, an excessive emphasis on overall performance scores obscures crucial error analysis, which is vital for identifying failure modes and improving real-world system performance. Third, the field predominantly adopts dataset-specific training-testing paradigms, hindering the understanding of model robustness and generalization across diverse infrared scenarios. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a hybrid-level metric incorporating pixel- and target-level performance, proposing a systematic error analysis method, and emphasizing the importance of cross-dataset evaluation. These aim to offer a more thorough and rational hierarchical analysis framework, ultimately fostering the development of more effective and robust IRSTD models. An open-source toolkit has be released to facilitate standardized benchmarking.

<title>Learning from Gene Names, Expression Values and Images: Contrastive Masked Text-Image Pretraining for Spatial Transcriptomics Representation Learning</title>

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics aims to connect high-resolution histology images with spatially resolved gene expression. To achieve better performance on downstream tasks such as gene expression prediction, large-scale pre-training is required to obtain generalisable representations that can bridge histology and transcriptomics across tissues, protocols, and laboratories. Existing cross-modal pre-training approaches for spatial transcriptomics rely on either gene names or expression values in isolation, which strips the gene branch of essential semantics and breaks the association between each gene and its quantitative magnitude. In addition, by restricting supervision to image-text alignment, these methods ignore intrinsic visual cues that are critical for learning robust image features. We present CoMTIP, the first Contrastive Masked Text-Image Pretraining framework that jointly learns from images, gene names, and expression values while capturing fine-grained visual context for spatial transcriptomics. The vision branch uses Masked Feature Modeling to reconstruct occluded patches and learn context-aware image embeddings. The text branch applies a scalable Gene-Text Encoder that processes all gene sentences in parallel, enriches each gene and its numerical value with dedicated embeddings, and employs Pair-aware Adversarial Training (PAAT) to preserve correct gene-value associations. Image and text representations are aligned in a shared InfoNCE-optimised space. Experiments on public spatial transcriptomics datasets show that CoMTIP not only surpasses previous methods on diverse downstream tasks but also achieves zero-shot gene expression prediction, a capability that existing approaches do not provide.

<title>PRISM: Precision-Recall Informed Data-Free Knowledge Distillation via Generative Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to a student without access to the real in-distribution (ID) data. While existing methods perform well on small-scale images, they suffer from mode collapse when synthesizing large-scale images, resulting in limited knowledge transfer. Recently, leveraging advanced generative models to synthesize photorealistic images has emerged as a promising alternative. Nevertheless, directly using off-the-shelf diffusion to generate datasets faces the precision-recall challenges: 1) ensuring synthetic data aligns with the real distribution, and 2) ensuring coverage of the real ID manifold. In response, we propose PRISM, a precision-recall informed synthesis method. Specifically, we introduce Energy-guided Distribution Alignment to avoid the generation of out-of-distribution samples, and design the Diversified Prompt Engineering to enhance coverage of the real ID manifold. Extensive experiments on various large-scale image datasets demonstrate the superiority of PRISM. Moreover, we demonstrate that models trained with PRISM exhibit strong domain generalization.

<title>ME-Mamba: Multi-Expert Mamba with Efficient Knowledge Capture and Fusion for Multimodal Survival Analysis</title>

Abstract: Survival analysis using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer research. Despite significant successes, pathology images typically only provide slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of discriminative representations from gigapixel WSIs. With the rapid advancement of high-throughput sequencing technologies, multimodal survival analysis integrating pathology images and genomics data has emerged as a promising approach. We propose a Multi-Expert Mamba (ME-Mamba) system that captures discriminative pathological and genomic features while enabling efficient integration of both modalities. This approach achieves complementary information fusion without losing critical information from individual modalities, thereby facilitating accurate cancer survival analysis. Specifically, we first introduce a Pathology Expert and a Genomics Expert to process unimodal data separately. Both experts are designed with Mamba architectures that incorporate conventional scanning and attention-based scanning mechanisms, allowing them to extract discriminative features from long instance sequences containing substantial redundant or irrelevant information. Second, we design a Synergistic Expert responsible for modality fusion. It explicitly learns token-level local correspondences between the two modalities via Optimal Transport, and implicitly enhances distribution consistency through a global cross-modal fusion loss based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy. The fused feature representations are then passed to a mamba backbone for further integration. Through the collaboration of the Pathology Expert, Genomics Expert, and Synergistic Expert, our method achieves stable and accurate survival analysis with relatively low computational complexity. Extensive experimental results on five datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We present SLAM-Former, a novel neural approach that integrates full SLAM capabilities into a single transformer. Similar to traditional SLAM systems, SLAM-Former comprises both a frontend and a backend that operate in tandem. The frontend processes sequential monocular images in real-time for incremental mapping and tracking, while the backend performs global refinement to ensure a geometrically consistent result. This alternating execution allows the frontend and backend to mutually promote one another, enhancing overall system performance. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that SLAM-Former achieves superior or highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art dense SLAM methods.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are rare abnormal cell divisions associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Their detection remains a significant challenge due to subtle morphological cues, class imbalance, and inter-observer variability among pathologists. The MIDOG 2025 challenge introduced a dedicated track for atypical mitosis classification, enabling systematic evaluation of deep learning methods. In this study, we investigated the use of large vision foundation models, including Virchow, Virchow2, and UNI, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We conducted extensive experiments with different LoRA ranks, as well as random and group-based data splits, to analyze robustness under varied conditions. Our best approach, Virchow with LoRA rank 8 and ensemble of three-fold cross-validation, achieved a balanced accuracy of 88.37% on the preliminary test set, ranking joint 9th in the challenge leaderboard. These results highlight the promise of foundation models with efficient adaptation strategies for the classification of atypical mitosis, while underscoring the need for improvements in specificity and domain generalization.

<title>Prototype-Based Pseudo-Label Denoising for Source-Free Domain Adaptation in Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.16942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) enables domain adaptation for semantic segmentation of Remote Sensing Images (RSIs) using only a well-trained source model and unlabeled target domain data. However, the lack of ground-truth labels in the target domain often leads to the generation of noisy pseudo-labels. Such noise impedes the effective mitigation of domain shift (DS). To address this challenge, we propose ProSFDA, a prototype-guided SFDA framework. It employs prototype-weighted pseudo-labels to facilitate reliable self-training (ST) under pseudo-labels noise. We, in addition, introduce a prototype-contrast strategy that encourages the aggregation of features belonging to the same class, enabling the model to learn discriminative target domain representations without relying on ground-truth supervision. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms existing methods.

<title>Catching the Details: Self-Distilled RoI Predictors for Fine-Grained MLLM Perception</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16944</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.16944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require high-resolution visual information to perform fine-grained perception, yet processing entire high-resolution images is computationally prohibitive. While recent methods leverage a Region-of-Interest (RoI) mechanism to focus on salient areas, they typically present a difficult trade-off: training-based approaches depend on large-scale annotated datasets, while training-free methods that utilize the model's internal attention are computationally inefficient and less accurate, requiring either multi-pass prefill stages or reliance on the slow auto-regressive decoding process. In this paper, we propose an efficient, annotation-free Self-Distilled Region Proposal Network (SD-RPN) that resolves this trade-off. The SD-RPN is built around a pipeline that transforms the noisy attention maps from the MLLM's middle layers into high-quality pseudo-RoI labels by explicitly denoising the signal and resolving ambiguity. We use these labels to train a lightweight Region Proposal Network (RPN) that learns a more precise localization. This RPN is also highly efficient, predicting the RoI in a single forward pass using features from the MLLM's middle layers, decoupling RoI identification from the auto-regressive generation and avoiding costly multi-pass operations.To validate our approach, we integrate the framework into the LLaVA-1.5 architecture. Despite being trained on only a few (e.g. 10K) question-answer pairs, our method demonstrates exceptional data efficiency and generalization, achieving over a 10% absolute accuracy improvement on unseen benchmarks, including TextVQA, DocVQA, and V-Star. Our work presents a practical and scalable solution for enhancing the fine-grained perception of MLLMs without requiring costly supervision or full model fine-tuning.

<title>Leveraging RGB Images for Pre-Training of Event-Based Hand Pose Estimation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16949</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16949</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.16949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents RPEP, the first pre-training method for event-based 3D hand pose estimation using labeled RGB images and unpaired, unlabeled event data. Event data offer significant benefits such as high temporal resolution and low latency, but their application to hand pose estimation is still limited by the scarcity of labeled training data. To address this, we repurpose real RGB datasets to train event-based estimators. This is done by constructing pseudo-event-RGB pairs, where event data is generated and aligned with the ground-truth poses of RGB images. Unfortunately, existing pseudo-event generation techniques assume stationary objects, thus struggling to handle non-stationary, dynamically moving hands. To overcome this, RPEP introduces a novel generation strategy that decomposes hand movements into smaller, step-by-step motions. This decomposition allows our method to capture temporal changes in articulation, constructing more realistic event data for a moving hand. Additionally, RPEP imposes a motion reversal constraint, regularizing event generation using reversed motion. Extensive experiments show that our pre-trained model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real event data, achieving up to 24% improvement on EvRealHands. Moreover, it delivers strong performance with minimal labeled samples for fine-tuning, making it well-suited for practical deployment.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation is an emerging field in generative AI, enabling the creation of realistic, semantically accurate videos from text prompts. While current models achieve impressive visual quality and alignment with input text, they typically rely on static knowledge, making it difficult to incorporate new data without retraining from scratch. To address this limitation, we propose VidCLearn, a continual learning framework for diffusion-based text-to-video generation. VidCLearn features a student-teacher architecture where the student model is incrementally updated with new text-video pairs, and the teacher model helps preserve previously learned knowledge through generative replay. Additionally, we introduce a novel temporal consistency loss to enhance motion smoothness and a video retrieval module to provide structural guidance at inference. Our architecture is also designed to be more computationally efficient than existing models while retaining satisfactory generation performance. Experimental results show VidCLearn's superiority over baseline methods in terms of visual quality, semantic alignment, and temporal coherence.

Abstract: Oriented object detection for multi-spectral imagery faces significant challenges due to differences both within and between modalities. Although existing methods have improved detection accuracy through complex network architectures, their high computational complexity and memory consumption severely restrict their performance. Motivated by the success of large kernel convolutions in remote sensing, we propose MO R-CNN, a lightweight framework for multi-spectral oriented detection featuring heterogeneous feature extraction network (HFEN), single modality supervision (SMS), and condition-based multimodal label fusion (CMLF). HFEN leverages inter-modal differences to adaptively align, merge, and enhance multi-modal features. SMS constrains multi-scale features and enables the model to learn from multiple modalities. CMLF fuses multimodal labels based on specific rules, providing the model with a more robust and consistent supervisory signal. Experiments on the DroneVehicle, VEDAI and OGSOD datasets prove the superiority of our method. The source code is available at:https://github.com/Iwill-github/MORCNN.

<title>Penalizing Boundary Activation for Object Completeness in Diffusion Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.16968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful technique for text-to-image (T2I) generation, creating high-quality, diverse images across various domains. However, a common limitation in these models is the incomplete display of objects, where fragments or missing parts undermine the model's performance in downstream applications. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the incompleteness issue and reveal that the primary factor behind incomplete object generation is the usage of RandomCrop during model training. This widely used data augmentation method, though enhances model generalization ability, disrupts object continuity during training. To address this, we propose a training-free solution that penalizes activation values at image boundaries during the early denoising steps. Our method is easily applicable to pre-trained Stable Diffusion models with minimal modifications and negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing substantial improvements in object integrity and image quality.

Abstract: Sparse annotation in remote sensing object detection poses significant challenges due to dense object distributions and category imbalances. Although existing Dense Pseudo-Label methods have demonstrated substantial potential in pseudo-labeling tasks, they remain constrained by selection ambiguities and inconsistencies in confidence estimation.In this paper, we introduce an LLM-assisted semantic guidance framework tailored for sparsely annotated remote sensing object detection, exploiting the advanced semantic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to distill high-confidence pseudo-labels.By integrating LLM-generated semantic priors, we propose a Class-Aware Dense Pseudo-Label Assignment mechanism that adaptively assigns pseudo-labels for both unlabeled and sparsely labeled data, ensuring robust supervision across varying data distributions. Additionally, we develop an Adaptive Hard-Negative Reweighting Module to stabilize the supervised learning branch by mitigating the influence of confounding background information. Extensive experiments on DOTA and HRSC2016 demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing single-stage detector-based frameworks, significantly improving detection performance under sparse annotations.

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting and tracking objects in videos conditioned on natural-language expressions, demanding fine-grained understanding of both appearance and motion. Building on Sa2VA, which couples a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) with the video segmentation model SAM2, we identify two key bottlenecks that limit segmentation performance: sparse frame sampling and reliance on a single [SEG] token for an entire video. We propose Segmentation Augmented and Selective Averaged Sa2VA SaSaSa2VA to address these issues. On the 7th LSVOS Challenge (RVOS track), SaSaSa2VA achieves a $J\&amp;F$ of 67.45, ranking first and surpassing the runner-up by 2.80 points. This result and ablation studies demonstrate that efficient segmentation augmentation and test-time ensembling substantially enhance grounded MLLMs for RVOS. The code is released in Sa2VA repository: https://github.com/magic-research/Sa2VA.

Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a task of central importance in the field of document image understanding. State-of-the-art methods for HTR require the use of extensive annotated sets for training, making them impractical for low-resource domains like historical archives or limited-size modern collections. This paper introduces a novel framework that, unlike the standard HTR model paradigm, can leverage mild prior knowledge of lexical characteristics; this is ideal for scenarios where labeled data are scarce. We propose an iterative bootstrapping approach that aligns visual features extracted from unlabeled images with semantic word representations using Optimal Transport (OT). Starting with a minimal set of labeled examples, the framework iteratively matches word images to text labels, generates pseudo-labels for high-confidence alignments, and retrains the recognizer on the growing dataset. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our iterative visual-semantic alignment scheme significantly improves recognition accuracy on low-resource HTR benchmarks.

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive image generation models have wowed audiences with their remarkable capability in creating surprisingly realistic images. Models such as GPT-4o and LlamaGen can not only produce images that faithfully mimic renowned artistic styles like Ghibli, Van Gogh, or Picasso, but also potentially generate Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content, raising significant concerns regarding copyright infringement and ethical use. Despite these concerns, methods to safeguard autoregressive text-to-image models remain underexplored. Previous concept erasure methods, primarily designed for diffusion models that operate in denoising latent space, are not directly applicable to autoregressive models that generate images token by token. To address this critical gap, we propose Visual Contrast Exploitation (VCE), a novel framework comprising: (1) an innovative contrastive image pair construction paradigm that precisely decouples unsafe concepts from their associated content semantics, and (2) a sophisticated DPO-based training approach that enhances the model's ability to identify and leverage visual contrastive features from image pairs, enabling precise concept erasure. Our comprehensive experiments across three challenging tasks-artist style erasure, explicit content erasure, and object removal-demonstrate that our method effectively secures the model, achieving state-of-the-art results while erasing unsafe concepts and maintaining the integrity of unrelated safe concepts. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Maplebb/VCE.

Abstract: Hyperspectral change detection (HCD) aims to accurately identify land-cover changes in hyperspectral images of the same area acquired at different times, with key applications in environmental monitoring and disaster assessment. To address limitations of existing methods, such as insufficient use of multiscale features and low efficiency in differential feature fusion, this paper proposes a cross-hierarchical multi-feature fusion network (CHMFFN) based on a multiscale encoder-decoder architecture. The front-end adopts a multiscale feature extraction subnetwork, built on an encoder-decoder backbone with residual connections and a dual-core channel-spatial attention (DCCSA) module to extract spectral-spatial-temporal features (SSTF). The encoder captures multiscale features from shallow details to deep semantics via residual blocks and convolutional kernels with varying receptive fields. The decoder restores spatial resolution and suppresses noise information through skip connections integrating encoder features. Additionally, a spectral-temporal change feature learning (STCFL) module learns cross-temporal change features at different levels, strengthening inter-temporal difference capture. An adaptive fusion of advanced features (AFAF) module dynamically balances hierarchical differential features via adaptive weights, enhancing representation of complex changes. Experiments on four public hyperspectral datasets show CHMFFN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, verifying its effectiveness.

Abstract: Document image quality assessment (DIQA) is an important component for various applications, including optical character recognition (OCR), document restoration, and the evaluation of document image processing systems. In this paper, we introduce a subjective DIQA dataset DIQA-5000. The DIQA-5000 dataset comprises 5,000 document images, generated by applying multiple document enhancement techniques to 500 real-world images with diverse distortions. Each enhanced image was rated by 15 subjects across three rating dimensions: overall quality, sharpness, and color fidelity. Furthermore, we propose a specialized no-reference DIQA model that exploits document layout features to maintain quality perception at reduced resolutions to lower computational cost. Recognizing that image quality is influenced by both low-level and high-level visual features, we designed a feature fusion module to extract and integrate multi-level features from document images. To generate multi-dimensional scores, our model employs independent quality heads for each dimension to predict score distributions, allowing it to learn distinct aspects of document image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art general-purpose IQA models on both DIQA-5000 and an additional document image dataset focused on OCR accuracy.

<title>When Color-Space Decoupling Meets Diffusion for Adverse-Weather Image Restoration</title>

Abstract: Adverse Weather Image Restoration (AWIR) is a highly challenging task due to the unpredictable and dynamic nature of weather-related degradations. Traditional task-specific methods often fail to generalize to unseen or complex degradation types, while recent prompt-learning approaches depend heavily on the degradation estimation capabilities of vision-language models, resulting in inconsistent restorations. In this paper, we propose \textbf{LCDiff}, a novel framework comprising two key components: \textit{Lumina-Chroma Decomposition Network} (LCDN) and \textit{Lumina-Guided Diffusion Model} (LGDM). LCDN processes degraded images in the YCbCr color space, separately handling degradation-related luminance and degradation-invariant chrominance components. This decomposition effectively mitigates weather-induced degradation while preserving color fidelity. To further enhance restoration quality, LGDM leverages degradation-related luminance information as a guiding condition, eliminating the need for explicit degradation prompts. Additionally, LGDM incorporates a \textit{Dynamic Time Step Loss} to optimize the denoising network, ensuring a balanced recovery of both low- and high-frequency features in the image. Finally, we present DriveWeather, a comprehensive all-weather driving dataset designed to enable robust evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, setting a new benchmark in AWIR. The dataset and code are available at: https://github.com/fiwy0527/LCDiff.

Abstract: Surgical simulation is essential for medical training, enabling practitioners to develop crucial skills in a risk-free environment while improving patient safety and surgical outcomes. However, conventional methods for building simulation environments are cumbersome, time-consuming, and difficult to scale, often resulting in poor details and unrealistic simulations. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Splatting-based framework to directly reconstruct interactive surgical scenes from endoscopic data while ensuring efficiency, rendering quality, and realism. A key challenge in this data-driven simulation paradigm is the restricted movement of endoscopic cameras, which limits viewpoint diversity. As a result, the Gaussian Splatting representation overfits specific perspectives, leading to reduced geometric accuracy. To address this issue, we introduce a novel virtual camera-based regularization method that adaptively samples virtual viewpoints around the scene and incorporates them into the optimization process to mitigate overfitting. An effective depth-based regularization is applied to both real and virtual views to further refine the scene geometry. To enable fast deformation simulation, we propose a sparse control node-based Material Point Method, which integrates physical properties into the reconstructed scene while significantly reducing computational costs. Experimental results on representative surgical data demonstrate that our method can efficiently reconstruct and simulate surgical scenes from sparse endoscopic views. Notably, our method takes only a few minutes to reconstruct the surgical scene and is able to produce physically plausible deformations in real-time with user-defined interactions.

Abstract: Multi-image Interleaved Reasoning aims to improve Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) ability to jointly comprehend and reason across multiple images and their associated textual contexts, introducing unique challenges beyond single-image or non-interleaved multi-image tasks. While current multi-image benchmarks overlook interleaved textual contexts and neglect distinct relationships between individual images and their associated texts, enabling models to reason over multi-image interleaved data may significantly enhance their comprehension of complex scenes and better capture cross-modal correlations. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark MIR, requiring joint reasoning over multiple images accompanied by interleaved textual contexts to accurately associate image regions with corresponding texts and logically connect information across images. To enhance MLLMs ability to comprehend multi-image interleaved data, we introduce reasoning steps for each instance within the benchmark and propose a stage-wise curriculum learning strategy. This strategy follows an "easy to hard" approach, progressively guiding models from simple to complex scenarios, thereby enhancing their ability to handle challenging tasks. Extensive experiments benchmarking multiple MLLMs demonstrate that our method significantly enhances models reasoning performance on MIR and other established benchmarks. We believe that MIR will encourage further research into multi-image interleaved reasoning, facilitating advancements in MLLMs capability to handle complex inter-modal tasks.Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Shelly-coder239/MIRBench.

<title>Towards Generalized Synapse Detection Across Invertebrate Species</title>

Abstract: Behavioural differences across organisms, whether healthy or pathological, are closely tied to the structure of their neural circuits. Yet, the fine-scale synaptic changes that give rise to these variations remain poorly understood, in part due to persistent challenges in detecting synapses reliably and at scale. Volume electron microscopy (EM) offers the resolution required to capture synaptic architecture, but automated detection remains difficult due to sparse annotations, morphological variability, and cross-dataset domain shifts. To address this, we make three key contributions. First, we curate a diverse EM benchmark spanning four datasets across two invertebrate species: adult and larval Drosophila melanogaster, and Megaphragma viggianii (micro-WASP). Second, we propose SimpSyn, a single-stage Residual U-Net trained to predict dual-channel spherical masks around pre- and post-synaptic sites, designed to prioritize training and inference speeds and annotation efficiency over architectural complexity. Third, we benchmark SimpSyn against Buhmann et al.'s Synful [1], a state-of-the-art multi-task model that jointly infers synaptic pairs. Despite its simplicity, SimpSyn consistently outperforms Synful in F1-score across all volumes for synaptic site detection. While generalization across datasets remains limited, SimpSyn achieves competitive performance when trained on the combined cohort. Finally, ablations reveal that simple post-processing strategies - such as local peak detection and distance-based filtering - yield strong performance without complex test-time heuristics. Taken together, our results suggest that lightweight models, when aligned with task structure, offer a practical and scalable solution for synapse detection in large-scale connectomic pipelines.

Abstract: Accurate crop disease diagnosis is essential for sustainable agriculture and global food security. Existing methods, which primarily rely on unimodal models such as image-based classifiers and object detectors, are limited in their ability to incorporate domain-specific agricultural knowledge and lack support for interactive, language-based understanding. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) have opened new avenues for multimodal reasoning. However, their performance in agricultural contexts remains limited due to the absence of specialized datasets and insufficient domain adaptation. In this work, we propose AgriDoctor, a modular and extensible multimodal framework designed for intelligent crop disease diagnosis and agricultural knowledge interaction. As a pioneering effort to introduce agent-based multimodal reasoning into the agricultural domain, AgriDoctor offers a novel paradigm for building interactive and domain-adaptive crop health solutions. It integrates five core components: a router, classifier, detector, knowledge retriever and LLMs. To facilitate effective training and evaluation, we construct AgriMM, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 400000 annotated disease images, 831 expert-curated knowledge entries, and 300000 bilingual prompts for intent-driven tool selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AgriDoctor, trained on AgriMM, significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LVLMs on fine-grained agricultural tasks, establishing a new paradigm for intelligent and sustainable farming applications.

Abstract: Fine-grained hashing has become a powerful solution for rapid and efficient image retrieval, particularly in scenarios requiring high discrimination between visually similar categories. To enable each hash bit to correspond to specific visual attributes, we propoe a novel method that harnesses learnable queries for attribute-aware hash codes learning. This method deploys a tailored set of queries to capture and represent nuanced attribute-level information within the hashing process, thereby enhancing both the interpretability and relevance of each hash bit. Building on this query-based optimization framework, we incorporate an auxiliary branch to help alleviate the challenges of complex landscape optimization often encountered with low-bit hash codes. This auxiliary branch models high-order attribute interactions, reinforcing the robustness and specificity of the generated hash codes. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method generates attribute-aware hash codes and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in retrieval accuracy and robustness, especially for low-bit hash codes, underscoring its potential in fine-grained image hashing tasks.

Abstract: Nonlinear manifolds are widespread in deep visual features, where Euclidean distances often fail to capture true similarity. This limitation becomes particularly severe in prototype-based interpretable fine-grained recognition, where subtle semantic distinctions are essential. To address this challenge, we propose a novel paradigm for prototype-based recognition that anchors similarity within the intrinsic geometry of deep features. Specifically, we distill the latent manifold structure of each class into a diffusion space and introduce a differentiable Nystr\"om interpolation, making the geometry accessible to both unseen samples and learnable prototypes. To ensure efficiency, we employ compact per-class landmark sets with periodic updates. This design keeps the embedding aligned with the evolving backbone, enabling fast and scalable inference. Extensive experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and Stanford Cars datasets show that our GeoProto framework produces prototypes focusing on semantically aligned parts, significantly outperforming Euclidean prototype networks.

<title>CardiacCLIP: Video-based CLIP Adaptation for LVEF Prediction in a Few-shot Manner</title>

Abstract: Echocardiography is a vital non-invasive modality for cardiac assessment, with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) serving as a key indicator of heart function. Existing LVEF estimation methods depend on large-scale annotated video datasets, which are costly and limit adaptability across various clinical settings. Recent vision-language models for echocardiography, such as EchoCLIP, apply image-to-text pretraining but fail to capture crucial temporal dynamics and localized cardiac structures essential for accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose CardiacCLIP, a video-based framework that enhances LVEF prediction through attention-based frame aggregation and multi-resolution input scaling. Specifically, we introduce MFL (Multi Frame Learning), a novel attention-based mechanism for selectively fusing informative frames, and EchoZoom, a multi-scale feature extraction strategy that refines spatial representations of cardiac structures. As a novel adaptation of CLIP models for few-shot echocardiogram video analysis, our approach significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, reducing MAE by 2.07 on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset under 1-shot setting. The code is available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/CardiacCLIP.

<title>Informative Text-Image Alignment for Visual Affordance Learning with Foundation Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17074</link>

Abstract: Visual affordance learning is crucial for robots to understand and interact effectively with the physical world. Recent advances in this field attempt to leverage pre-trained knowledge of vision-language foundation models to learn affordance properties with limited training data, providing a novel paradigm for visual affordance learning. However, these methods overlook the significance of maintaining feature alignment between visual images and language descriptions for identifying affordance areas with textual guidance, and thus may lead to suboptimal results. In this paper, we present an informative framework for text-guided affordance learning, which involves information-based constraints to achieve text-image alignment at feature level. Specifically, we design an affordance mutual information constraint that helps learn appropriate textual prompts and task-oriented visual features simultaneously by maximizing the mutual information between the features of the affordance areas in the input images and the corresponding textual prompts. In addition, we propose an object-level information constraint that maximizes the mutual information between the visual features of a given object and the text features of the category it belongs to. This enables the model to capture high-quality representations for the object, providing more reliable semantic priors for identifying affordance regions. Experimental results on the AGD20K dataset show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and achieves the new state-of-the-art in one-shot affordance learning.

Abstract: While one-stage detectors like YOLOv8 offer fast training speed, they often under-perform on detecting small objects as a trade-off. This becomes even more critical when detecting tiny objects in aerial imagery due to low-resolution targets and cluttered backgrounds. To address this, we introduce three enhancement strategies -- input image resolution adjustment, data augmentation, and attention mechanisms -- that can be easily implemented on YOLOv8. We demonstrate that image size enlargement and the proper use of augmentation can lead to enhancement. Additionally, we designed a Mixture of Orthogonal Neural-modules Network (MoonNet) pipeline which consists of attention-augmented CNNs. Two well-known attention modules, the Squeeze-and-Excitation Block (SE Block) and the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), were integrated into the backbone of YOLOv8 with an increased number of channels, and the MoonNet backbone obtained improved detection accuracy compared to the original YOLOv8. MoonNet further proved its adaptability and potential by achieving state-of-the-art performance on a tiny-object benchmark when integrated with the YOLC model.

<title>A Dual-Modulation Framework for RGB-T Crowd Counting via Spatially Modulated Attention and Adaptive Fusion</title>

Abstract: Accurate RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) crowd counting is crucial for public safety in challenging conditions. While recent Transformer-based methods excel at capturing global context, their inherent lack of spatial inductive bias causes attention to spread to irrelevant background regions, compromising crowd localization precision. Furthermore, effectively bridging the gap between these distinct modalities remains a major hurdle. To tackle this, we propose the Dual Modulation Framework, comprising two modules: Spatially Modulated Attention (SMA), which improves crowd localization by using a learnable Spatial Decay Mask to penalize attention between distant tokens and prevent focus from spreading to the background; and Adaptive Fusion Modulation (AFM), which implements a dynamic gating mechanism to prioritize the most reliable modality for adaptive cross-modal fusion. Extensive experiments on RGB-T crowd counting datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to previous works. Code available at https://github.com/Cht2924/RGBT-Crowd-Counting.

<title>HyRF: Hybrid Radiance Fields for Memory-efficient and High-quality Novel View Synthesis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.17083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful alternative to NeRF-based approaches, enabling real-time, high-quality novel view synthesis through explicit, optimizable 3D Gaussians. However, 3DGS suffers from significant memory overhead due to its reliance on per-Gaussian parameters to model view-dependent effects and anisotropic shapes. While recent works propose compressing 3DGS with neural fields, these methods struggle to capture high-frequency spatial variations in Gaussian properties, leading to degraded reconstruction of fine details. We present Hybrid Radiance Fields (HyRF), a novel scene representation that combines the strengths of explicit Gaussians and neural fields. HyRF decomposes the scene into (1) a compact set of explicit Gaussians storing only critical high-frequency parameters and (2) grid-based neural fields that predict remaining properties. To enhance representational capacity, we introduce a decoupled neural field architecture, separately modeling geometry (scale, opacity, rotation) and view-dependent color. Additionally, we propose a hybrid rendering scheme that composites Gaussian splatting with a neural field-predicted background, addressing limitations in distant scene representation. Experiments demonstrate that HyRF achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while reducing model size by over 20 times compared to 3DGS and maintaining real-time performance.

Abstract: Video action recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision, but state-of-the-art models are often computationally expensive and rely on extensive video pre-training. In parallel, large-scale vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) offer powerful zero-shot capabilities on static images, while motion vectors (MV) provide highly efficient temporal information directly from compressed video streams. To synergize the strengths of these paradigms, we propose MoCLIP-Lite, a simple yet powerful two-stream late fusion framework for efficient video recognition. Our approach combines features from a frozen CLIP image encoder with features from a lightweight, supervised network trained on raw MV. During fusion, both backbones are frozen, and only a tiny Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head is trained, ensuring extreme efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments on the UCF101 dataset, our method achieves a remarkable 89.2% Top-1 accuracy, significantly outperforming strong zero-shot (65.0%) and MV-only (66.5%) baselines. Our work provides a new, highly efficient baseline for video understanding that effectively bridges the gap between large static models and dynamic, low-cost motion cues. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/microa/MoCLIP-Lite.

Abstract: Detecting and localizing poultry is essential for advancing smart poultry farming. Despite the progress of detection-centric methods, challenges persist in free-range settings due to multiscale targets, obstructions, and complex or dynamic backgrounds. To tackle these challenges, we introduce an innovative poultry detection approach named SFN-YOLO that utilizes scale-aware fusion. This approach combines detailed local features with broader global context to improve detection in intricate environments. Furthermore, we have developed a new expansive dataset (M-SCOPE) tailored for varied free-range conditions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our model achieves an mAP of 80.7% with just 7.2M parameters, which is 35.1% fewer than the benchmark, while retaining strong generalization capability across different domains. The efficient and real-time detection capabilities of SFN-YOLO support automated smart poultry farming. The code and dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/chenjessiee/SFN-YOLO.

Abstract: Despite their generative power, diffusion models struggle to maintain style consistency across images conditioned on the same style prompt, hindering their practical deployment in creative workflows. While several training-free methods attempt to solve this, they are constrained to the U-Net architecture, which not only leads to low-quality results and artifacts like object repetition but also renders them incompatible with superior Diffusion Transformer (DiT). To address these issues, we introduce AlignedGen, a novel training-free framework that enhances style consistency across images generated by DiT models. Our work first reveals a critical insight: naive attention sharing fails in DiT due to conflicting positional signals from improper position embeddings. We introduce Shifted Position Embedding (ShiftPE), an effective solution that resolves this conflict by allocating a non-overlapping set of positional indices to each image. Building on this foundation, we develop Advanced Attention Sharing (AAS), a suite of three techniques meticulously designed to fully unleash the potential of attention sharing within the DiT. Furthermore, to broaden the applicability of our method, we present an efficient query, key, and value feature extraction algorithm, enabling our method to seamlessly incorporate external images as style references. Extensive experimental results validate that our method effectively enhances style consistency across generated images while maintaining precise text-to-image alignment.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation has been widely studied in medical image segmentation as a tool to provide reliability, particularly in deep learning approaches. However, previous methods generally lack effective supervision in uncertainty estimation, leading to low interpretability and robustness of the predictions. In this work, we propose a self-supervised approach to guide the learning of uncertainty. Specifically, we introduce three principles about the relationships between the uncertainty and the image gradients around boundaries and noise. Based on these principles, two uncertainty supervision losses are designed. These losses enhance the alignment between model predictions and human interpretation. Accordingly, we introduce novel quantitative metrics for evaluating the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method can achieve competitive segmentation performance and superior results in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios while significantly improving the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for surgical quality assessment promise to democratize access to expertise, with applications in training, guidance, and accreditation. This study presents the SAGES Critical View of Safety (CVS) Challenge, the first AI competition organized by a surgical society, using the CVS in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a universally recommended yet inconsistently performed safety step, as an exemplar of surgical quality assessment. A global collaboration across 54 institutions in 24 countries engaged hundreds of clinicians and engineers to curate 1,000 videos annotated by 20 surgical experts according to a consensus-validated protocol. The challenge addressed key barriers to real-world deployment in surgery, including achieving high performance, capturing uncertainty in subjective assessment, and ensuring robustness to clinical variability. To enable this scale of effort, we developed EndoGlacier, a framework for managing large, heterogeneous surgical video and multi-annotator workflows. Thirteen international teams participated, achieving up to a 17\% relative gain in assessment performance, over 80\% reduction in calibration error, and a 17\% relative improvement in robustness over the state-of-the-art. Analysis of results highlighted methodological trends linked to model performance, providing guidance for future research toward robust, clinically deployable AI for surgical quality assessment.

<title>CoBEVMoE: Heterogeneity-aware Feature Fusion with Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Collaborative Perception</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.17107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception aims to extend sensing coverage and improve perception accuracy by sharing information among multiple agents. However, due to differences in viewpoints and spatial positions, agents often acquire heterogeneous observations. Existing intermediate fusion methods primarily focus on aligning similar features, often overlooking the perceptual diversity among agents. To address this limitation, we propose CoBEVMoE, a novel collaborative perception framework that operates in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space and incorporates a Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (DMoE) architecture. In DMoE, each expert is dynamically generated based on the input features of a specific agent, enabling it to extract distinctive and reliable cues while attending to shared semantics. This design allows the fusion process to explicitly model both feature similarity and heterogeneity across agents. Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Expert Metric Loss (DEML) to enhance inter-expert diversity and improve the discriminability of the fused representation. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V and DAIR-V2X-C datasets demonstrate that CoBEVMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, it improves the IoU for Camera-based BEV segmentation by +1.5% on OPV2V and the AP@50 for LiDAR-based 3D object detection by +3.0% on DAIR-V2X-C, verifying the effectiveness of expert-based heterogeneous feature modeling in multi-agent collaborative perception. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/godk0509/CoBEVMoE.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models can generate striking visuals from text prompts, but they often fail to maintain subject consistency across generations and contexts. One major limitation of current fine-tuning approaches is the inherent trade-off between quality and efficiency. Fine-tuning large models improves fidelity but is computationally expensive, while fine-tuning lightweight models improves efficiency but compromises image fidelity. Moreover, fine-tuning pre-trained models on a small set of images of the subject can damage the existing priors, resulting in suboptimal results. To this end, we present Stencil, a novel framework that jointly employs two diffusion models during inference. Stencil efficiently fine-tunes a lightweight model on images of the subject, while a large frozen pre-trained model provides contextual guidance during inference, injecting rich priors to enhance generation with minimal overhead. Stencil excels at generating high-fidelity, novel renditions of the subject in less than a minute, delivering state-of-the-art performance and setting a new benchmark in subject-driven generation.

Abstract: Industrial vision inspection requires high accuracy under stringent resource constraints, yet existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) deliver strong reasoning capabilities but incur prohibitive computational costs, while lightweight edge models often fail on complex cases. In this paper, we present SAEC, a scene-aware enhanced edge-cloud collaborative industrial vision inspection framework with MLLM. The framework is composed of three synergistic components: (1) Efficient MLLM Fine-Tuning for Complex Defect Inspection, (2) Lightweight Multiscale Scene-Complexity Estimation, and (3) Adaptive Edge-Cloud Scheduler. Together, these modules enable robust defect detection by tailoring multimodal reasoning to scene complexity and dynamically balancing computation between edge and cloud resources. Experimental results on MVTec AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrate that SAEC attains 85.11% and 82.72% accuracy, surpassing Qwen by 22.1% and 20.8%, and LLaVA by 33.3% and 31.6%. It also reduces runtime by up to 22.4% and cuts energy per correct decision by 40%-74%. The code is available at https://github.com/YuHao-Tian/SAEC.

Abstract: The automated prediction of facial beauty is a benchmark task in affective computing that requires a sophisticated understanding of both local aesthetic details (e.g., skin texture) and global facial harmony (e.g., symmetry, proportions). Existing models, based on either Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Vision Transformers (ViTs), exhibit inherent architectural biases that limit their performance; CNNs excel at local feature extraction but struggle with long-range dependencies, while ViTs model global relationships at a significant computational cost. This paper introduces the \textbf{Mamba-Diffusion Network (MD-Net)}, a novel dual-stream architecture that resolves this trade-off by delegating specialized roles to state-of-the-art models. The first stream leverages a frozen U-Net encoder from a pre-trained latent diffusion model, providing a powerful generative prior for fine-grained aesthetic qualities. The second stream employs a Vision Mamba (Vim), a modern state-space model, to efficiently capture global facial structure with linear-time complexity. By synergistically integrating these complementary representations through a cross-attention mechanism, MD-Net creates a holistic and nuanced feature space for prediction. Evaluated on the SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, MD-Net sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9235} and demonstrating the significant potential of hybrid architectures that fuse generative and sequential modeling paradigms for complex visual assessment tasks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of medical images is challenging due to unclear lesion boundaries and mask variability. We introduce \emph{Segmentation Sch\"{o}dinger Bridge (SSB)}, the first application of Sch\"{o}dinger Bridge for ambiguous medical image segmentation, modelling joint image-mask dynamics to enhance performance. SSB preserves structural integrity, delineates unclear boundaries without additional guidance, and maintains diversity using a novel loss function. We further propose the \emph{Diversity Divergence Index} ($D_{DDI}$) to quantify inter-rater variability, capturing both diversity and consensus. SSB achieves state-of-the-art performance on LIDC-IDRI, COCA, and RACER (in-house) datasets.

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality globally, and echocardiography is critical for diagnosis of both common and congenital cardiac conditions. However, echocardiographic data for certain pathologies are scarce, hindering the development of robust automated diagnosis models. In this work, we propose Echo-Path, a novel generative framework to produce echocardiogram videos conditioned on specific cardiac pathologies. Echo-Path can synthesize realistic ultrasound video sequences that exhibit targeted abnormalities, focusing here on atrial septal defect (ASD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Our approach introduces a pathology-conditioning mechanism into a state-of-the-art echo video generator, allowing the model to learn and control disease-specific structural and motion patterns in the heart. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the synthetic videos achieve low distribution distances, indicating high visual fidelity. Clinically, the generated echoes exhibit plausible pathology markers. Furthermore, classifiers trained on our synthetic data generalize well to real data and, when used to augment real training sets, it improves downstream diagnosis of ASD and PAH by 7\% and 8\% respectively. Code, weights and dataset are available here https://github.com/Marshall-mk/EchoPathv1

Abstract: Analyzing cultural-heritage artifacts remains challenging for MLLMs: general models lack domain expertise, and SFT often overfits superficial patterns, yielding brittle reasoning for authentication and historical attribution. This raises the question of how to equip MLLMs with robust, expert-level reasoning for ancient Greek pottery. We present VaseVL, an SFT-then-RL system that turns evaluation into supervision: we construct a taxonomy of question types, probe the SFT model to localize type-specific performance gaps, and optimize with type-conditioned, compositionality-oriented rewards targeting those gaps. We also release VaseVQA, a comprehensive benchmark of 31,773 images designed to probe deep understanding. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on style classification and historical attribution with marked gains in compositional robustness over SFT-only baselines, validating diagnosis-guided, taxonomy-conditioned reward engineering and providing a reusable resource for future research. Code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/VaseVQA.

<title>Guided and Unguided Conditional Diffusion Mechanisms for Structured and Semantically-Aware 3D Point Cloud Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17206</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17206</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D point clouds is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in remote sensing, robotics, and digital object modeling. Existing generative approaches primarily capture geometry, and when semantics are considered, they are typically imposed post hoc through external segmentation or clustering rather than integrated into the generative process itself. We propose a diffusion-based framework that embeds per-point semantic conditioning directly within generation. Each point is associated with a conditional variable corresponding to its semantic label, which guides the diffusion dynamics and enables the joint synthesis of geometry and semantics. This design produces point clouds that are both structurally coherent and segmentation-aware, with object parts explicitly represented during synthesis. Through a comparative analysis of guided and unguided diffusion processes, we demonstrate the significant impact of conditional variables on diffusion dynamics and generation quality. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach, producing detailed and accurate 3D point clouds tailored to specific parts and features.

<title>Point-RTD: Replaced Token Denoising for Pretraining Transformer Models on Point Clouds</title>

Abstract: Pre-training strategies play a critical role in advancing the performance of transformer-based models for 3D point cloud tasks. In this paper, we introduce Point-RTD (Replaced Token Denoising), a novel pretraining strategy designed to improve token robustness through a corruption-reconstruction framework. Unlike traditional mask-based reconstruction tasks that hide data segments for later prediction, Point-RTD corrupts point cloud tokens and leverages a discriminator-generator architecture for denoising. This shift enables more effective learning of structural priors and significantly enhances model performance and efficiency. On the ShapeNet dataset, Point-RTD reduces reconstruction error by over 93% compared to PointMAE, and achieves more than 14x lower Chamfer Distance on the test set. Our method also converges faster and yields higher classification accuracy on ShapeNet, ModelNet10, and ModelNet40 benchmarks, clearly outperforming the baseline Point-MAE framework in every case.

Abstract: This paper presents MirrorSAM2, the first framework that adapts Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to the task of RGB-D video mirror segmentation. MirrorSAM2 addresses key challenges in mirror detection, such as reflection ambiguity and texture confusion, by introducing four tailored modules: a Depth Warping Module for RGB and depth alignment, a Depth-guided Multi-Scale Point Prompt Generator for automatic prompt generation, a Frequency Detail Attention Fusion Module to enhance structural boundaries, and a Mirror Mask Decoder with a learnable mirror token for refined segmentation. By fully leveraging the complementarity between RGB and depth, MirrorSAM2 extends SAM2's capabilities to the prompt-free setting. To our knowledge, this is the first work to enable SAM2 for automatic video mirror segmentation. Experiments on the VMD and DVMD benchmark demonstrate that MirrorSAM2 achieves SOTA performance, even under challenging conditions such as small mirrors, weak boundaries, and strong reflections.

arXiv:2509.17232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Diffusion Model-Optimized Neural Radiance Field (DT-NeRF) method, aimed at enhancing detail recovery and multi-view consistency in 3D scene reconstruction. By combining diffusion models with Transformers, DT-NeRF effectively restores details under sparse viewpoints and maintains high accuracy in complex geometric scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that DT-NeRF significantly outperforms traditional NeRF and other state-of-the-art methods on the Matterport3D and ShapeNet datasets, particularly in metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, Chamfer Distance, and Fidelity. Ablation experiments further confirm the critical role of the diffusion and Transformer modules in the model's performance, with the removal of either module leading to a decline in performance. The design of DT-NeRF showcases the synergistic effect between modules, providing an efficient and accurate solution for 3D scene reconstruction. Future research may focus on further optimizing the model, exploring more advanced generative models and network architectures to enhance its performance in large-scale dynamic scenes.

<title>SPFSplatV2: Efficient Self-Supervised Pose-Free 3D Gaussian Splatting from Sparse Views</title>

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplatV2, an efficient feed-forward framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training and inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a canonical space from unposed inputs. A masked attention mechanism is introduced to efficiently estimate target poses during training, while a reprojection loss enforces pixel-aligned Gaussian primitives, providing stronger geometric constraints. We further demonstrate the compatibility of our training framework with different reconstruction architectures, resulting in two model variants. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose supervision, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain novel view synthesis, even under extreme viewpoint changes and limited image overlap, and surpasses recent methods that rely on geometric supervision for relative pose estimation. By eliminating dependence on ground-truth poses, our method offers the scalability to leverage larger and more diverse datasets. Code and pretrained models will be available on our project page: https://ranrhuang.github.io/spfsplatv2/.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Efficient data compression is crucial for the storage and transmission of visual data. However, in facial expression recognition (FER) tasks, lossy compression often leads to feature degradation and reduced accuracy. To address these challenges, this study proposes an end-to-end model designed to preserve critical features and enhance both compression and recognition performance. A custom loss function is introduced to optimize the model, tailored to balance compression and recognition performance effectively. This study also examines the influence of varying loss term weights on this balance. Experimental results indicate that fine-tuning the compression model alone improves classification accuracy by 0.71% and compression efficiency by 49.32%, while joint optimization achieves significant gains of 4.04% in accuracy and 89.12% in efficiency. Moreover, the findings demonstrate that the jointly optimized classification model maintains high accuracy on both compressed and uncompressed data, while the compression model reliably preserves image details, even at high compression rates.

<title>Task-Oriented Communications for 3D Scene Representation: Balancing Timeliness and Fidelity</title>

Abstract: Real-time Three-dimensional (3D) scene representation is a foundational element that supports a broad spectrum of cutting-edge applications, including digital manufacturing, Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR/AR/MR), and the emerging metaverse. Despite advancements in real-time communication and computing, achieving a balance between timeliness and fidelity in 3D scene representation remains a challenge. This work investigates a wireless network where multiple homogeneous mobile robots, equipped with cameras, capture an environment and transmit images to an edge server over channels for 3D representation. We propose a contextual-bandit Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) framework incorporating both Age of Information (AoI) and semantic information to optimize image selection for representation, balancing data freshness and representation quality. Two policies -- the $\omega$-threshold and $\omega$-wait policies -- together with two benchmark methods are evaluated, timeliness embedding and weighted sum, on standard datasets and baseline 3D scene representation models. Experimental results demonstrate improved representation fidelity while maintaining low latency, offering insight into the model's decision-making process. This work advances real-time 3D scene representation by optimizing the trade-off between timeliness and fidelity in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Building compliance checking (BCC) is a critical process for ensuring that constructed facilities meet regulatory standards. A core component of BCC is the accurate enumeration of facility types and their spatial distribution. Despite its importance, this problem has been largely overlooked in the literature, posing a significant challenge for BCC and leaving a critical gap in existing workflows. Performing this task manually is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to enhance automation by combining visual recognition with reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a new task for BCC: automated facility enumeration, which involves validating the quantity of each facility type against statutory requirements. To address it, we propose a novel method that integrates door detection with LLM-based reasoning. We are the first to apply LLMs to this task and further enhance their performance through a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) pipeline. Our approach generalizes well across diverse datasets and facility types. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic floor plan data demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.

<title>DepTR-MOT: Unveiling the Potential of Depth-Informed Trajectory Refinement for Multi-Object Tracking</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17323</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.17323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a crucial component of robotic perception, yet existing Tracking-By-Detection (TBD) methods often rely on 2D cues, such as bounding boxes and motion modeling, which struggle under occlusions and close-proximity interactions. Trackers relying on these 2D cues are particularly unreliable in robotic environments, where dense targets and frequent occlusions are common. While depth information has the potential to alleviate these issues, most existing MOT datasets lack depth annotations, leading to its underexploited role in the domain. To unveil the potential of depth-informed trajectory refinement, we introduce DepTR-MOT, a DETR-based detector enhanced with instance-level depth information. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: (i) foundation model-based instance-level soft depth label supervision, which refines depth prediction, and (ii) the distillation of dense depth maps to maintain global depth consistency. These strategies enable DepTR-MOT to output instance-level depth during inference, without requiring foundation models and without additional computational cost. By incorporating depth cues, our method enhances the robustness of the TBD paradigm, effectively resolving occlusion and close-proximity challenges. Experiments on both the QuadTrack and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving HOTA scores of 27.59 and 44.47, respectively. In particular, results on QuadTrack, a robotic platform MOT dataset, highlight the advantages of our method in handling occlusion and close-proximity challenges in robotic tracking. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/warriordby/DepTR-MOT.

Abstract: Building autonomous agents that perceive and operate graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like humans has long been a vision in the field of artificial intelligence. Central to these agents is the capability for GUI interaction, which involves GUI understanding and planning capabilities. Existing methods have tried developing GUI agents based on the multi-modal comprehension ability of vision-language models (VLMs). However, the limited scenario, insufficient size, and heterogeneous action spaces hinder the progress of building generalist GUI agents. To resolve these issues, this paper proposes \textbf{UIPro}, a novel generalist GUI agent trained with extensive multi-platform and multi-task GUI interaction data, coupled with a unified action space. We first curate a comprehensive dataset encompassing 20.6 million GUI understanding tasks to pre-train UIPro, granting it a strong GUI grounding capability, which is key to downstream GUI agent tasks. Subsequently, we establish a unified action space to harmonize heterogeneous GUI agent task datasets and produce a merged dataset to foster the action prediction ability of UIPro via continued fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate UIPro's superior performance across multiple GUI task benchmarks on various platforms, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Smoke in real-world scenes can severely degrade the quality of images and hamper visibility. Recent methods for image restoration either rely on data-driven priors that are susceptible to hallucinations, or are limited to static low-density smoke. We introduce SmokeSeer, a method for simultaneous 3D scene reconstruction and smoke removal from a video capturing multiple views of a scene. Our method uses thermal and RGB images, leveraging the fact that the reduced scattering in thermal images enables us to see through the smoke. We build upon 3D Gaussian splatting to fuse information from the two image modalities, and decompose the scene explicitly into smoke and non-smoke components. Unlike prior approaches, SmokeSeer handles a broad range of smoke densities and can adapt to temporally varying smoke. We validate our approach on synthetic data and introduce a real-world multi-view smoke dataset with RGB and thermal images. We provide open-source code and data at the project website.

Abstract: Automatic image captioning, a multifaceted task bridging computer vision and natural lan- guage processing, aims to generate descriptive textual content from visual input. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have achieved significant advancements, they present limitations. The inherent sequential nature of RNNs leads to sluggish training and inference times. LSTMs further struggle with retaining information from earlier sequence elements when dealing with very long se- quences. This project presents a comprehensive guide to constructing and comprehending transformer models for image captioning. Transformers employ self-attention mechanisms, capturing both short- and long-range dependencies within the data. This facilitates efficient parallelization during both training and inference phases. We leverage the well-established Transformer architecture, recognized for its effectiveness in managing sequential data, and present a meticulous methodology. Utilizing the Flickr30k dataset, we conduct data pre- processing, construct a model architecture that integrates an EfficientNetB0 CNN for fea- ture extraction, and train the model with attention mechanisms incorporated. Our approach exemplifies the utilization of parallelization for efficient training and inference. You can find the project on GitHub.

Abstract: Large-scale vision language pre-training has recently shown promise for no-reference image-quality assessment (NR-IQA), yet the relative merits of modern Vision Transformer foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of six prominent pretrained backbones, CLIP, SigLIP2, DINOv2, DINOv3, Perception, and ResNet, for the task of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA), each finetuned using an identical lightweight MLP head. Our study uncovers two previously overlooked factors: (1) SigLIP2 consistently achieves strong performance; and (2) the choice of activation function plays a surprisingly crucial role, particularly for enhancing the generalization ability of image quality assessment models. Notably, we find that simple sigmoid activations outperform commonly used ReLU and GELU on several benchmarks. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a learnable activation selection mechanism that adaptively determines the nonlinearity for each channel, eliminating the need for manual activation design, and achieving new state-of-the-art SRCC on CLIVE, KADID10K, and AGIQA3K. Extensive ablations confirm the benefits across architectures and regimes, establishing strong, resource-efficient NR-IQA baselines.

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are vital for reliable urban positioning. However, multipath and non-line-of-sight reception often introduce large measurement errors that degrade accuracy. Learning-based methods for predicting and compensating pseudorange errors have gained traction, but their performance is limited by complex error distributions. To address this challenge, we propose Diff-GNSS, a coarse-to-fine GNSS measurement (pseudorange) error estimation framework that leverages a conditional diffusion model to capture such complex distributions. Firstly, a Mamba-based module performs coarse estimation to provide an initial prediction with appropriate scale and trend. Then, a conditional denoising diffusion layer refines the estimate, enabling fine-grained modeling of pseudorange errors. To suppress uncontrolled generative diversity and achieve controllable synthesis, three key features related to GNSS measurement quality are used as conditions to precisely guide the reverse denoising process. We further incorporate per-satellite uncertainty modeling within the diffusion stage to assess the reliability of the predicted errors. We have collected and publicly released a real-world dataset covering various scenes. Experiments on public and self-collected datasets show that DiffGNSS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models to pseudorange error estimation. The proposed diffusion-based refinement module is plug-and-play and can be readily integrated into existing networks to markedly improve estimation accuracy.

Abstract: How do vision transformers (ViTs) represent and process the world? This paper addresses this long-standing question through the first systematic analysis of 6.6K features across all layers, extracted via sparse autoencoders, and by introducing the residual replacement model, which replaces ViT computations with interpretable features in the residual stream. Our analysis reveals not only a feature evolution from low-level patterns to high-level semantics, but also how ViTs encode curves and spatial positions through specialized feature types. The residual replacement model scalably produces a faithful yet parsimonious circuit for human-scale interpretability by significantly simplifying the original computations. As a result, this framework enables intuitive understanding of ViT mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our framework in debiasing spurious correlations.

Abstract: Indonesia's marine ecosystems, part of the globally recognized Coral Triangle, are among the richest in biodiversity, requiring efficient monitoring tools to support conservation. Traditional fish detection methods are time-consuming and demand expert knowledge, prompting the need for automated solutions. This study explores the implementation of YOLOv10-nano, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, for real-time marine fish detection in Indonesian waters, using test data from Bunaken National Marine Park. YOLOv10's architecture, featuring improvements like the CSPNet backbone, PAN for feature fusion, and Pyramid Spatial Attention Block, enables efficient and accurate object detection even in complex environments. The model was evaluated on the DeepFish and OpenImages V7-Fish datasets. Results show that YOLOv10-nano achieves a high detection accuracy with mAP50 of 0.966 and mAP50:95 of 0.606 while maintaining low computational demand (2.7M parameters, 8.4 GFLOPs). It also delivered an average inference speed of 29.29 FPS on the CPU, making it suitable for real-time deployment. Although OpenImages V7-Fish alone provided lower accuracy, it complemented DeepFish in enhancing model robustness. Overall, this study demonstrates YOLOv10-nano's potential for efficient, scalable marine fish monitoring and conservation applications in data-limited environments.

Abstract: We propose a single-snapshot depth-from-defocus (DFD) reconstruction method for coded-aperture imaging that replaces hand-crafted priors with a learned diffusion prior used purely as regularization. Our optimization framework enforces measurement consistency via a differentiable forward model while guiding solutions with the diffusion prior in the denoised image domain, yielding higher accuracy and stability than clas- sical optimization. Unlike U-Net-style regressors, our approach requires no paired defocus-RGBD training data and does not tie training to a specific camera configuration. Experiments on comprehensive simulations and a prototype camera demonstrate consistently strong RGBD reconstructions across noise levels, outperforming both U-Net baselines and a classical coded- aperture DFD method.

Abstract: Accurate temporal prediction is the bridge between comprehensive scene understanding and embodied artificial intelligence. However, predicting multiple fine-grained states of a scene at multiple temporal scales is difficult for vision-language models. We formalize the Multi-Scale Temporal Prediction (MSTP) task in general and surgical scenes by decomposing multi-scale into two orthogonal dimensions: the temporal scale, forecasting states of humans and surgery at varying look-ahead intervals, and the state scale, modeling a hierarchy of states in general and surgical scenes. For example, in general scenes, states of contact relationships are finer-grained than states of spatial relationships. In surgical scenes, medium-level steps are finer-grained than high-level phases yet remain constrained by their encompassing phase. To support this unified task, we introduce the first MSTP Benchmark, featuring synchronized annotations across multiple state scales and temporal scales. We further propose a method, Incremental Generation and Multi-agent Collaboration (IG-MC), which integrates two key innovations. First, we present a plug-and-play incremental generation module that continuously synthesizes up-to-date visual previews at expanding temporal scales to inform multiple decision-making agents, keeping decisions and generated visuals synchronized and preventing performance degradation as look-ahead intervals lengthen. Second, we present a decision-driven multi-agent collaboration framework for multi-state prediction, comprising generation, initiation, and multi-state assessment agents that dynamically trigger and evaluate prediction cycles to balance global coherence and local fidelity.

Abstract: The field of Embodied AI predominantly relies on simulation for training and evaluation, often using either fully synthetic environments that lack photorealism or high-fidelity real-world reconstructions captured with expensive hardware. As a result, sim-to-real transfer remains a major challenge. In this paper, we introduce EmbodiedSplat, a novel approach that personalizes policy training by efficiently capturing the deployment environment and fine-tuning policies within the reconstructed scenes. Our method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and the Habitat-Sim simulator to bridge the gap between realistic scene capture and effective training environments. Using iPhone-captured deployment scenes, we reconstruct meshes via GS, enabling training in settings that closely approximate real-world conditions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of training strategies, pre-training datasets, and mesh reconstruction techniques, evaluating their impact on sim-to-real predictivity in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that agents fine-tuned with EmbodiedSplat outperform both zero-shot baselines pre-trained on large-scale real-world datasets (HM3D) and synthetically generated datasets (HSSD), achieving absolute success rate improvements of 20\% and 40\% on real-world Image Navigation task. Moreover, our approach yields a high sim-vs-real correlation (0.87--0.97) for the reconstructed meshes, underscoring its effectiveness in adapting policies to diverse environments with minimal effort.

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to estimate accurate and robust 3D semantic correspondence with the hierarchical neural semantic representation. Our work has three key contributions. First, we design the hierarchical neural semantic representation (HNSR), which consists of a global semantic feature to capture high-level structure and multi-resolution local geometric features to preserve fine details, by carefully harnessing 3D priors from pre-trained 3D generative models. Second, we design a progressive global-to-local matching strategy, which establishes coarse semantic correspondence using the global semantic feature, then iteratively refines it with local geometric features, yielding accurate and semantically-consistent mappings. Third, our framework is training-free and broadly compatible with various pre-trained 3D generative backbones, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse shape categories. Our method also supports various applications, such as shape co-segmentation, keypoint matching, and texture transfer, and generalizes well to structurally diverse shapes, with promising results even in cross-category scenarios. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques.

<title>Training-Free Label Space Alignment for Universal Domain Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where label spaces may differ and the target domain may contain private classes. Previous UniDA methods primarily focused on visual space alignment but often struggled with visual ambiguities due to content differences, which limited their robustness and generalizability. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that leverages the strong \textit{zero-shot capabilities} of recent vision-language foundation models (VLMs) like CLIP, concentrating solely on label space alignment to enhance adaptation stability. CLIP can generate task-specific classifiers based only on label names. However, adapting CLIP to UniDA is challenging because the label space is not fully known in advance. In this study, we first utilize generative vision-language models to identify unknown categories in the target domain. Noise and semantic ambiguities in the discovered labels -- such as those similar to source labels (e.g., synonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms) -- complicate label alignment. To address this, we propose a training-free label-space alignment method for UniDA (\ours). Our method aligns label spaces instead of visual spaces by filtering and refining noisy labels between the domains. We then construct a \textit{universal classifier} that integrates both shared knowledge and target-private class information, thereby improving generalizability under domain shifts. The results reveal that the proposed method considerably outperforms existing UniDA techniques across key DomainBed benchmarks, delivering an average improvement of \textcolor{blue}{+7.9\%}in H-score and \textcolor{blue}{+6.1\%} in H$^3$-score. Furthermore, incorporating self-training further enhances performance and achieves an additional (\textcolor{blue}{+1.6\%}) increment in both H- and H$^3$-scores.

Abstract: The proliferation of facial recognition systems presents major privacy risks, driving the need for effective countermeasures. Current adversarial techniques apply generalized methods rather than adapting to individual facial characteristics, limiting their effectiveness and inconspicuousness. In this work, we introduce Layer Embedding Activation Mapping (LEAM), a novel technique that identifies which facial areas contribute most to recognition at an individual level. Unlike adversarial attack methods that aim to fool recognition systems, LEAM is an explainability technique designed to understand how these systems work, providing insights that could inform future privacy protection research. We integrate LEAM with a face parser to analyze data from 1000 individuals across 9 pre-trained facial recognition models.
  Our analysis reveals that while different layers within facial recognition models vary significantly in their focus areas, these models generally prioritize similar facial regions across architectures when considering their overall activation patterns, which show significantly higher similarity between images of the same individual (Bhattacharyya Coefficient: 0.32-0.57) vs. different individuals (0.04-0.13), validating the existence of person-specific recognition patterns. Our results show that facial recognition models prioritize the central region of face images (with nose areas accounting for 18.9-29.7% of critical recognition regions), while still distributing attention across multiple facial fragments. Proper selection of relevant facial areas was confirmed using validation occlusions, based on just 1% of the most relevant, LEAM-identified, image pixels, which proved to be transferable across different models. Our findings establish the foundation for future individually tailored privacy protection systems centered around LEAM's choice of areas to be perturbed.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships, attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning. While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone: optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image quality and diversity.

Abstract: Spike-based transformer is a novel architecture aiming to enhance the performance of spiking neural networks while mitigating the energy overhead inherent to transformers. However, methods for generating these models suffer from critical limitations: excessive training costs introduced by direct training methods, or unavoidably hardware-unfriendly operations in existing conversion methods. In this paper, we propose CSDformer, a novel conversion method for fully spike-driven transformers. We tailor a conversion-oriented transformer-based architecture and propose a new function NReLU to replace softmax in self-attention. Subsequently, this model is quantized and trained, and converted into a fully spike-driven model with temporal decomposition technique. Also, we propose delayed Integrate-andFire neurons to reduce conversion errors and improve the performance of spiking models. We evaluate CSDformer on ImageNet, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets and achieve 76.36% top-1 accuracy under 7 time-steps on ImageNet, demonstrating superiority over state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, CSDformer eliminates the need for training SNNs, thereby reducing training costs (reducing computational resource by 75% and accelerating training speed by 2-3$\times$). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully spike-driven transformer-based model developed via conversion method, achieving high performance under ultra-low latency, while dramatically reducing both computational complexity and training overhead.

Abstract: The goal of multi-task learning is to learn to conduct multiple tasks simultaneously based on a shared data representation. While this approach can improve learning efficiency, it may also cause performance degradation due to task conflicts that arise when optimizing the model for different objectives. To address this challenge, we introduce MAESTRO, a structured framework designed to generate task-specific features and mitigate feature interference in multi-task 3D perception, including 3D object detection, bird's-eye view (BEV) map segmentation, and 3D occupancy prediction. MAESTRO comprises three components: the Class-wise Prototype Generator (CPG), the Task-Specific Feature Generator (TSFG), and the Scene Prototype Aggregator (SPA). CPG groups class categories into foreground and background groups and generates group-wise prototypes. The foreground and background prototypes are assigned to the 3D object detection task and the map segmentation task, respectively, while both are assigned to the 3D occupancy prediction task. TSFG leverages these prototype groups to retain task-relevant features while suppressing irrelevant features, thereby enhancing the performance for each task. SPA enhances the prototype groups assigned for 3D occupancy prediction by utilizing the information produced by the 3D object detection head and the map segmentation head. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D benchmarks demonstrate that MAESTRO consistently outperforms existing methods across 3D object detection, BEV map segmentation, and 3D occupancy prediction tasks.

Abstract: Portrait animation aims to generate photo-realistic videos from a single source image by reenacting the expression and pose from a driving video. While early methods relied on 3D morphable models or feature warping techniques, they often suffered from limited expressivity, temporal inconsistency, and poor generalization to unseen identities or large pose variations. Recent advances using diffusion models have demonstrated improved quality but remain constrained by weak control signals and architectural limitations. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion based framework that leverages masked facial regions specifically the eyes, nose, and mouth from the driving video as strong motion control cues. To enable robust training without appearance leakage, we adopt cross identity supervision. To leverage the strong prior from the pretrained diffusion model, our novel architecture introduces minimal new parameters that converge faster and help in better generalization. We introduce spatial temporal attention mechanisms that allow inter frame and intra frame interactions, effectively capturing subtle motions and reducing temporal artifacts. Our model uses history frames to ensure continuity across segments. At inference, we propose a novel signal fusion strategy that balances motion fidelity with identity preservation. Our approach achieves superior temporal consistency and accurate expression control, enabling high-quality, controllable portrait animation suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress, yet hallucination remains a critical barrier, particularly in chart understanding, which requires sophisticated perceptual and cognitive abilities as well as rigorous factual accuracy. While prior work has investigated hallucinations and chart comprehension independently, their intersection remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present ChartHal, a benchmark that features a fine-grained taxonomy of hallucination scenarios in chart understanding, along with a human-validated dataset of 1,062 samples. Our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art LVLMs suffer from severe hallucinations on ChartHal, including proprietary models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini, which achieve only 34.46% and 22.79% accuracy, respectively. Further analysis reveals that questions involving information absent from or contradictory to charts are especially likely to trigger hallucinations, underscoring the urgent need for more robust mitigation strategies. Code and data are available at https://github.com/ymcui/ChartHal .

Abstract: Multimodal pathological images are usually in clinical diagnosis, but computer vision-based multimodal image-assisted diagnosis faces challenges with modality fusion, especially in the absence of expert-annotated data. To achieve the modality fusion in multimodal images with label scarcity, we propose a novel ``pretraining + fine-tuning" framework for multimodal semi-supervised medical image classification. Specifically, we propose a synergistic learning pretraining framework of consistency, reconstructive, and aligned learning. By treating one modality as an augmented sample of another modality, we implement a self-supervised learning pre-train, enhancing the baseline model's feature representation capability. Then, we design a fine-tuning method for multimodal fusion. During the fine-tuning stage, we set different encoders to extract features from the original modalities and provide a multimodal fusion encoder for fusion modality. In addition, we propose a distribution shift method for multimodal fusion features, which alleviates the prediction uncertainty and overfitting risks caused by the lack of labeled samples. We conduct extensive experiments on the publicly available gastroscopy image datasets Kvasir and Kvasirv2. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art classification methods. The code will be released at: https://github.com/LQH89757/MICS.

Abstract: Driver drowsiness remains a critical factor in road accidents, accounting for thousands of fatalities and injuries each year. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of real-time, non-intrusive drowsiness detection methods, focusing on computer vision based YOLO (You Look Only Once) algorithms. A publicly available dataset namely, UTA-RLDD was used, containing both awake and drowsy conditions, ensuring variability in gender, eyewear, illumination, and skin tone. Seven YOLO variants (v5s, v9c, v9t, v10n, v10l, v11n, v11l) are fine-tuned, with performance measured in terms of Precision, Recall, mAP0.5, and mAP 0.5-0.95. Among these, YOLOv9c achieved the highest accuracy (0.986 mAP 0.5, 0.978 Recall) while YOLOv11n strikes the optimal balance between precision (0.954) and inference efficiency, making it highly suitable for embedded deployment. Additionally, we implement an Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) approach using Dlib's facial landmarks, which despite its low computational footprint exhibits reduced robustness under pose variation and occlusions. Our findings illustrate clear trade offs between accuracy, latency, and resource requirements, and offer practical guidelines for selecting or combining detection methods in autonomous driving and industrial safety applications.

Abstract: Large-scale Video Object Segmentation (LSVOS) addresses the challenge of accurately tracking and segmenting objects in long video sequences, where difficulties stem from object reappearance, small-scale targets, heavy occlusions, and crowded scenes. Existing approaches predominantly adopt SAM2-based frameworks with various memory mechanisms for complex video mask generation. In this report, we proposed Segment Anything with Memory Strengthened Object Navigation (SAMSON), the 3rd place solution in the MOSE track of ICCV 2025, which integrates the strengths of stateof-the-art VOS models into an effective paradigm. To handle visually similar instances and long-term object disappearance in MOSE, we incorporate a long-term memorymodule for reliable object re-identification. Additionly, we adopt SAM2Long as a post-processing strategy to reduce error accumulation and enhance segmentation stability in long video sequences. Our method achieved a final performance of 0.8427 in terms of J &amp;F in the test-set leaderboard.

Abstract: Volumetric video has emerged as a key medium for immersive telepresence and augmented/virtual reality, enabling six-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) navigation and realistic spatial interactions. However, delivering high-quality dynamic volumetric content at scale remains challenging due to massive data volume, complex motion, and limited editability of existing representations. In this paper, we present 4D-MoDe, a motion-decoupled 4D Gaussian compression framework designed for scalable and editable volumetric video streaming. Our method introduces a layered representation that explicitly separates static backgrounds from dynamic foregrounds using a lookahead-based motion decomposition strategy, significantly reducing temporal redundancy and enabling selective background/foreground streaming. To capture continuous motion trajectories, we employ a multi-resolution motion estimation grid and a lightweight shared MLP, complemented by a dynamic Gaussian compensation mechanism to model emergent content. An adaptive grouping scheme dynamically inserts background keyframes to balance temporal consistency and compression efficiency. Furthermore, an entropy-aware training pipeline jointly optimizes the motion fields and Gaussian parameters under a rate-distortion (RD) objective, while employing range-based and KD-tree compression to minimize storage overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that 4D-MoDe consistently achieves competitive reconstruction quality with an order of magnitude lower storage cost (e.g., as low as \textbf{11.4} KB/frame) compared to state-of-the-art methods, while supporting practical applications such as background replacement and foreground-only streaming.

Abstract: Achieving seamless viewing of high-fidelity volumetric video, comparable to 2D video experiences, remains an open challenge. Existing volumetric video compression methods either lack the flexibility to adjust quality and bitrate within a single model for efficient streaming across diverse networks and devices, or struggle with real-time decoding and rendering on lightweight mobile platforms. To address these challenges, we introduce 4DGCPro, a novel hierarchical 4D Gaussian compression framework that facilitates real-time mobile decoding and high-quality rendering via progressive volumetric video streaming in a single bitstream. Specifically, we propose a perceptually-weighted and compression-friendly hierarchical 4D Gaussian representation with motion-aware adaptive grouping to reduce temporal redundancy, preserve coherence, and enable scalable multi-level detail streaming. Furthermore, we present an end-to-end entropy-optimized training scheme, which incorporates layer-wise rate-distortion (RD) supervision and attribute-specific entropy modeling for efficient bitstream generation. Extensive experiments show that 4DGCPro enables flexible quality and multiple bitrate within a single model, achieving real-time decoding and rendering on mobile devices while outperforming existing methods in RD performance across multiple datasets.

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation requires accurate identification of hierarchical regions including whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC), and enhancing tumor (ET) from multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. Due to tumor tissue heterogeneity, ambiguous boundaries, and contrast variations across MRI sequences, methods relying solely on visual information or post-hoc loss constraints show unstable performance in boundary delineation and hierarchy preservation. To address this challenge, we propose the Unified Multimodal Coherent Field (UMCF) method. This method achieves synchronous interactive fusion of visual, semantic, and spatial information within a unified 3D latent space, adaptively adjusting modal contributions through parameter-free uncertainty gating, with medical prior knowledge directly participating in attention computation, avoiding the traditional "process-then-concatenate" separated architecture. On Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2020 and 2021 datasets, UMCF+nnU-Net achieves average Dice coefficients of 0.8579 and 0.8977 respectively, with an average 4.18% improvement across mainstream architectures. By deeply integrating clinical knowledge with imaging features, UMCF provides a new technical pathway for multimodal information fusion in precision medicine.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide inherent interpretability by first predicting a set of human-understandable concepts and then mapping them to labels through a simple classifier. While users can intervene in the concept space to improve predictions, traditional CBMs typically employ a fixed linear classifier over concept scores, which restricts interventions to manual value adjustments and prevents the incorporation of new concepts or domain knowledge at test time. These limitations are particularly severe in unsupervised CBMs, where concept activations are often noisy and densely activated, making user interventions ineffective. We introduce Chat-CBM, which replaces score-based classifiers with a language-based classifier that reasons directly over concept semantics. By grounding prediction in the semantic space of concepts, Chat-CBM preserves the interpretability of CBMs while enabling richer and more intuitive interventions, such as concept correction, addition or removal of concepts, incorporation of external knowledge, and high-level reasoning guidance. Leveraging the language understanding and few-shot capabilities of frozen large language models, Chat-CBM extends the intervention interface of CBMs beyond numerical editing and remains effective even in unsupervised settings. Experiments on nine datasets demonstrate that Chat-CBM achieves higher predictive performance and substantially improves user interactivity while maintaining the concept-based interpretability of CBMs.

Abstract: Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment specific objects in videos based on natural language expressions involving audio, vision, and text information. This task poses significant challenges in cross-modal reasoning and fine-grained object localization. In this paper, we propose a simple framework, SimToken, that integrates a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The MLLM is guided to generate a special semantic token representing the referred object. This compact token, enriched with contextual information from all modalities, acts as a prompt to guide SAM to segment objectsacross video frames. To further improve semantic learning, we introduce a novel target-consistent semantic alignment loss that aligns token embeddings from different expressions but referring to the same object. Experiments on the Ref-AVS benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.Code will be available at https://github.com/DianJin-HFUT/SimToken

<title>An Empirical Study on the Robustness of YOLO Models for Underwater Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to underwater distortions which degrade low-level features and compromise the reliability of even state-of-the-art detectors. While YOLO models have become the backbone of real-time object detection, little work has systematically examined their robustness under these uniquely challenging conditions. This raises a critical question: Are YOLO models genuinely robust when operating under the chaotic and unpredictable conditions of underwater environments? In this study, we present one of the first comprehensive evaluations of recent YOLO variants (YOLOv8-YOLOv12) across six simulated underwater environments. Using a unified dataset of 10,000 annotated images from DUO and Roboflow100, we not only benchmark model robustness but also analyze how distortions affect key low-level features such as texture, edges, and color. Our findings show that (1) YOLOv12 delivers the strongest overall performance but is highly vulnerable to noise, and (2) noise disrupts edge and texture features, explaining the poor detection performance in noisy images. Class imbalance is a persistent challenge in UOD. Experiments revealed that (3) image counts and instance frequency primarily drive detection performance, while object appearance exerts only a secondary influence. Finally, we evaluated lightweight training-aware strategies: noise-aware sample injection, which improves robustness in both noisy and real-world conditions, and fine-tuning with advanced enhancement, which boosts accuracy in enhanced domains but slightly lowers performance in original data, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation, respectively. Together, these insights provide practical guidance for building resilient and cost-efficient UOD systems.

<title>Visual Instruction Pretraining for Domain-Specific Foundation Models</title>

Abstract: Modern computer vision is converging on a closed loop in which perception, reasoning and generation mutually reinforce each other. However, this loop remains incomplete: the top-down influence of high-level reasoning on the foundational learning of low-level perceptual features is not yet underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a new paradigm for pretraining foundation models in downstream domains. We introduce Visual insTruction Pretraining (ViTP), a novel approach that directly leverages reasoning to enhance perception. ViTP embeds a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone within a Vision-Language Model and pretrains it end-to-end using a rich corpus of visual instruction data curated from target downstream domains. ViTP is powered by our proposed Visual Robustness Learning (VRL), which compels the ViT to learn robust and domain-relevant features from a sparse set of visual tokens. Extensive experiments on 16 challenging remote sensing and medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that ViTP establishes new state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of downstream tasks. The code is available at github.com/zcablii/ViTP.

<title>MRN: Harnessing 2D Vision Foundation Models for Diagnosing Parkinson's Disease with Limited 3D MR Data</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17566</link>

Abstract: The automatic diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is in high clinical demand due to its prevalence and the importance of targeted treatment. Current clinical practice often relies on diagnostic biomarkers in QSM and NM-MRI images. However, the lack of large, high-quality datasets makes training diagnostic models from scratch prone to overfitting. Adapting pre-trained 3D medical models is also challenging, as the diversity of medical imaging leads to mismatches in voxel spacing and modality between pre-training and fine-tuning data. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging 2D vision foundation models (VFMs). Specifically, we crop multiple key ROIs from NM and QSM images, process each ROI through separate branches to compress the ROI into a token, and then combine these tokens into a unified patient representation for classification. Within each branch, we use 2D VFMs to encode axial slices of the 3D ROI volume and fuse them into the ROI token, guided by an auxiliary segmentation head that steers the feature extraction toward specific brain nuclei. Additionally, we introduce multi-ROI supervised contrastive learning, which improves diagnostic performance by pulling together representations of patients from the same class while pushing away those from different classes. Our approach achieved first place in the MICCAI 2025 PDCADxFoundation challenge, with an accuracy of 86.0% trained on a dataset of only 300 labeled QSM and NM-MRI scans, outperforming the second-place method by 5.5%.These results highlight the potential of 2D VFMs for clinical analysis of 3D MR images.

<title>PRNU-Bench: A Novel Benchmark and Model for PRNU-Based Camera Identification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: We propose a novel benchmark for camera identification via Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU) estimation. The benchmark comprises 13K photos taken with 120+ cameras, where the training and test photos are taken in different scenarios, enabling ``in-the-wild'' evaluation. In addition, we propose a novel PRNU-based camera identification model that employs a hybrid architecture, comprising a denoising autoencoder to estimate the PRNU signal and a convolutional network that can perform 1:N verification of camera devices. Instead of using a conventional approach based on contrastive learning, our method takes the Hadamard product between reference and query PRNU signals as input. This novel design leads to significantly better results compared with state-of-the-art models based on denoising autoencoders and contrastive learning. We release our dataset and code at: https://github.com/CroitoruAlin/PRNU-Bench.

<title>Interpreting Attention Heads for Image-to-Text Information Flow in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17588</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.17588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) answer visual questions by transferring information from images to text through a series of attention heads. While this image-to-text information flow is central to visual question answering, its underlying mechanism remains difficult to interpret due to the simultaneous operation of numerous attention heads. To address this challenge, we propose head attribution, a technique inspired by component attribution methods, to identify consistent patterns among attention heads that play a key role in information transfer. Using head attribution, we investigate how LVLMs rely on specific attention heads to identify and answer questions about the main object in an image. Our analysis reveals that a distinct subset of attention heads facilitates the image-to-text information flow. Remarkably, we find that the selection of these heads is governed by the semantic content of the input image rather than its visual appearance. We further examine the flow of information at the token level and discover that (1) text information first propagates to role-related tokens and the final token before receiving image information, and (2) image information is embedded in both object-related and background tokens. Our work provides evidence that image-to-text information flow follows a structured process, and that analysis at the attention-head level offers a promising direction toward understanding the mechanisms of LVLMs.

<title>Domain Adaptive Object Detection for Space Applications with Real-Time Constraints</title>

Abstract: Object detection is essential in space applications targeting Space Domain Awareness and also applications involving relative navigation scenarios. Current deep learning models for Object Detection in space applications are often trained on synthetic data from simulators, however, the model performance drops significantly on real-world data due to the domain gap. However, domain adaptive object detection is an overlooked problem in the community. In this work, we first show the importance of domain adaptation and then explore Supervised Domain Adaptation (SDA) to reduce this gap using minimal labeled real data. We build on a recent semi-supervised adaptation method and tailor it for object detection. Our approach combines domain-invariant feature learning with a CNN-based domain discriminator and invariant risk minimization using a domain-independent regression head. To meet real-time deployment needs, we test our method on a lightweight Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) with MobileNet backbone and on the more advanced Fully Convolutional One-Stage object detector (FCOS) with ResNet-50 backbone. We evaluated on two space datasets, SPEED+ and SPARK. The results show up to 20-point improvements in average precision (AP) with just 250 labeled real images.

<title>COLA: Context-aware Language-driven Test-time Adaptation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17598</link>

arXiv:2509.17598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) has gained increasing popularity due to its efficacy in addressing ``distribution shift'' issue while simultaneously protecting data privacy.
  However, most prior methods assume that a paired source domain model and target domain sharing the same label space coexist, heavily limiting their applicability.
  In this paper, we investigate a more general source model capable of adaptation to multiple target domains without needing shared labels.
  This is achieved by using a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), \egno, CLIP, that can recognize images through matching with class descriptions.
  While the zero-shot performance of VLMs is impressive, they struggle to effectively capture the distinctive attributes of a target domain.
  To that end, we propose a novel method -- Context-aware Language-driven TTA (COLA).
  The proposed method incorporates a lightweight context-aware module that consists of three key components: a task-aware adapter, a context-aware unit, and a residual connection unit for exploring task-specific knowledge, domain-specific knowledge from the VLM and prior knowledge of the VLM, respectively.
  It is worth noting that the context-aware module can be seamlessly integrated into a frozen VLM, ensuring both minimal effort and parameter efficiency.
  Additionally, we introduce a Class-Balanced Pseudo-labeling (CBPL) strategy to mitigate the adverse effects caused by class imbalance.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method not only in TTA scenarios but also in class generalisation tasks.

Abstract: Quadrat images are essential for ecological studies, as they enable standardized sampling, the assessment of plant biodiversity, long-term monitoring, and large-scale field campaigns. These images typically cover an area of fifty centimetres or one square meter, and botanists carefully identify all the species present. Integrating AI could help specialists accelerate their inventories and expand the spatial coverage of ecological studies. To assess progress in this area, the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge relies on a new test set of 2,105 high-resolution multi-label images annotated by experts and covering around 400 species. It also provides a large training set of 1.4 million individual plant images, along with vision transformer models pre-trained on this data. The task is formulated as a (weakly labelled) multi-label classification problem, where the goal is to predict all species present in a quadrat image using single-label training data. This paper provides a detailed description of the data, the evaluation methodology, the methods and models used by participants, and the results achieved.

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection is a strongly application-driven field of research. Consequently, the connection between academia and industry is of paramount importance. In this regard, we present the VAND 3.0 Challenge to showcase current progress in anomaly detection across different practical settings whilst addressing critical issues in the field. The challenge hosted two tracks, fostering the development of anomaly detection methods robust against real-world distribution shifts (Category 1) and exploring the capabilities of Vision Language Models within the few-shot regime (Category 2), respectively. The participants' solutions reached significant improvements over previous baselines by combining or adapting existing approaches and fusing them with novel pipelines. While for both tracks the progress in large pre-trained vision (language) backbones played a pivotal role for the performance increase, scaling up anomaly detection methods more efficiently needs to be addressed by future research to meet real-time and computational constraints on-site.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.17620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating camera intrinsic parameters without prior scene knowledge is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. This capability is particularly important for applications such as autonomous driving and vehicle platooning, where precalibrated setups are impractical and real-time adaptability is necessary. To advance the state-of-the-art, we present a set of equations based on the calibrated trifocal tensor, enabling projective camera self-calibration from minimal image data. Our method, termed TrifocalCalib, significantly improves accuracy and robustness compared to both recent learning-based and classical approaches. Unlike many existing techniques, our approach requires no calibration target, imposes no constraints on camera motion, and simultaneously estimates both focal length and principal point. Evaluations in both procedurally generated synthetic environments and structured dataset-based scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. To support reproducibility, we make the code publicly available.

Abstract: The world is estimated to be home to over 300,000 species of vascular plants. In the face of the ongoing biodiversity crisis, expanding our understanding of these species is crucial for the advancement of human civilization, encompassing areas such as agriculture, construction, and pharmacopoeia. However, the labor-intensive process of plant identification undertaken by human experts poses a significant obstacle to the accumulation of new data and knowledge. Fortunately, recent advancements in automatic identification, particularly through the application of deep learning techniques, have shown promising progress. Despite challenges posed by data-related issues such as a vast number of classes, imbalanced class distribution, erroneous identifications, duplications, variable visual quality, and diverse visual contents (such as photos or herbarium sheets), deep learning approaches have reached a level of maturity which gives us hope that in the near future we will have an identification system capable of accurately identifying all plant species worldwide. The PlantCLEF2023 challenge aims to contribute to this pursuit by addressing a multi-image (and metadata) classification problem involving an extensive set of classes (80,000 plant species). This paper provides an overview of the challenge's resources and evaluations, summarizes the methods and systems employed by participating research groups, and presents an analysis of key findings.

Abstract: Recent advances in video insertion based on diffusion models are impressive. However, existing methods rely on complex control signals but struggle with subject consistency, limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we focus on the task of Mask-free Video Insertion and aim to resolve three key challenges: data scarcity, subject-scene equilibrium, and insertion harmonization. To address the data scarcity, we propose a new data pipeline InsertPipe, constructing diverse cross-pair data automatically. Building upon our data pipeline, we develop OmniInsert, a novel unified framework for mask-free video insertion from both single and multiple subject references. Specifically, to maintain subject-scene equilibrium, we introduce a simple yet effective Condition-Specific Feature Injection mechanism to distinctly inject multi-source conditions and propose a novel Progressive Training strategy that enables the model to balance feature injection from subjects and source video. Meanwhile, we design the Subject-Focused Loss to improve the detailed appearance of the subjects. To further enhance insertion harmonization, we propose an Insertive Preference Optimization methodology to optimize the model by simulating human preferences, and incorporate a Context-Aware Rephraser module during reference to seamlessly integrate the subject into the original scenes. To address the lack of a benchmark for the field, we introduce InsertBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse scenes with meticulously selected subjects. Evaluation on InsertBench indicates OmniInsert outperforms state-of-the-art closed-source commercial solutions. The code will be released.

Abstract: It is estimated that there are more than 300,000 species of vascular plants in the world. Increasing our knowledge of these species is of paramount importance for the development of human civilization (agriculture, construction, pharmacopoeia, etc.), especially in the context of the biodiversity crisis. However, the burden of systematic plant identification by human experts strongly penalizes the aggregation of new data and knowledge. Since then, automatic identification has made considerable progress in recent years as highlighted during all previous editions of PlantCLEF. Deep learning techniques now seem mature enough to address the ultimate but realistic problem of global identification of plant biodiversity in spite of many problems that the data may present (a huge number of classes, very strongly unbalanced classes, partially erroneous identifications, duplications, variable visual quality, diversity of visual contents such as photos or herbarium sheets, etc). The PlantCLEF2022 challenge edition proposes to take a step in this direction by tackling a multi-image (and metadata) classification problem with a very large number of classes (80k plant species). This paper presents the resources and evaluations of the challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and provides an analysis of key findings.

<title>A$^2$M$^2$-Net: Adaptively Aligned Multi-Scale Moment for Few-Shot Action Recognition</title>

Abstract: Thanks to capability to alleviate the cost of large-scale annotation, few-shot action recognition (FSAR) has attracted increased attention of researchers in recent years. Existing FSAR approaches typically neglect the role of individual motion pattern in comparison, and under-explore the feature statistics for video dynamics. Thereby, they struggle to handle the challenging temporal misalignment in video dynamics, particularly by using 2D backbones. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes an adaptively aligned multi-scale second-order moment network, namely A$^2$M$^2$-Net, to describe the latent video dynamics with a collection of powerful representation candidates and adaptively align them in an instance-guided manner. To this end, our A$^2$M$^2$-Net involves two core components, namely, adaptive alignment (A$^2$ module) for matching, and multi-scale second-order moment (M$^2$ block) for strong representation. Specifically, M$^2$ block develops a collection of semantic second-order descriptors at multiple spatio-temporal scales. Furthermore, A$^2$ module aims to adaptively select informative candidate descriptors while considering the individual motion pattern. By such means, our A$^2$M$^2$-Net is able to handle the challenging temporal misalignment problem by establishing an adaptive alignment protocol for strong representation. Notably, our proposed method generalizes well to various few-shot settings and diverse metrics. The experiments are conducted on five widely used FSAR benchmarks, and the results show our A$^2$M$^2$-Net achieves very competitive performance compared to state-of-the-arts, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization.

Abstract: Building digital twins of articulated objects from monocular video presents an essential challenge in computer vision, which requires simultaneous reconstruction of object geometry, part segmentation, and articulation parameters from limited viewpoint inputs. Monocular video offers an attractive input format due to its simplicity and scalability; however, it's challenging to disentangle the object geometry and part dynamics with visual supervision alone, as the joint movement of the camera and parts leads to ill-posed estimation. While motion priors from pre-trained tracking models can alleviate the issue, how to effectively integrate them for articulation learning remains largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce VideoArtGS, a novel approach that reconstructs high-fidelity digital twins of articulated objects from monocular video. We propose a motion prior guidance pipeline that analyzes 3D tracks, filters noise, and provides reliable initialization of articulation parameters. We also design a hybrid center-grid part assignment module for articulation-based deformation fields that captures accurate part motion. VideoArtGS demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in articulation and mesh reconstruction, reducing the reconstruction error by about two orders of magnitude compared to existing methods. VideoArtGS enables practical digital twin creation from monocular video, establishing a new benchmark for video-based articulated object reconstruction. Our work is made publicly available at: https://videoartgs.github.io.

Abstract: Streaming visual transformers like StreamVGGT achieve strong 3D perception but suffer from unbounded growth of key value (KV) memory, which limits scalability. We propose a training-free, inference-time token eviction policy that bounds memory by discarding redundant tokens while keeping the most informative ones. Our method uses significantly less memory with little to no drop in accuracy: on 7-Scenes with long sequences it reduces peak memory from 18.63 GB to 9.39 GB while accuracy and completeness drop by only 0.003. Under strict memory budgets, eviction enables denser frame sampling, which improves reconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline. Experiments across video depth estimation (Sintel, KITTI), 3D reconstruction (7-Scenes, NRGBD), and camera pose estimation (Sintel, TUM-dynamics) show that our approach closely matches StreamVGGT at a fraction of the memory and makes long-horizon streaming inference more practical.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become very popular for Semantic Image Synthesis (SIS) of human faces. Nevertheless, their training and inference is computationally expensive and their computational requirements are high due to the quadratic complexity of attention layers. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture called SISMA, based on the recently proposed Mamba. SISMA generates high quality samples by controlling their shape using a semantic mask at a reduced computational demand. We validated our approach through comprehensive experiments with CelebAMask-HQ, revealing that our architecture not only achieves a better FID score yet also operates at three times the speed of state-of-the-art architectures. This indicates that the proposed design is a viable, lightweight substitute to transformer-based models.

Abstract: With the development of deep learning technology, virtual try-on technology has become an important application value in the fields of e-commerce, fashion, and entertainment. The recently proposed Leffa has improved the texture distortion problem of diffu-sion-based models, but there are limitations in that the bottom detection inaccuracy and the existing clothing silhouette remain in the synthesis results. To solve this problem, this study proposes CaP-VTON (Clothing agnostic Pre-inpainting Virtual Try-ON). CaP-VTON has improved the naturalness and consistency of whole-body clothing syn-thesis by integrating multi-category masking based on Dress Code and skin inpainting based on Stable Diffusion. In particular, a generate skin module was introduced to solve the skin restoration problem that occurs when long-sleeved images are converted into short-sleeved or sleeveless ones, and high-quality restoration was implemented consider-ing the human body posture and color. As a result, CaP-VTON recorded 92.5\%, which is 15.4\% better than Leffa in short-sleeved synthesis accuracy, and showed the performance of consistently reproducing the style and shape of reference clothing in visual evaluation. These structures maintain model-agnostic properties and are applicable to various diffu-sion-based virtual inspection systems, and can contribute to applications that require high-precision virtual wearing, such as e-commerce, custom styling, and avatar creation.

Abstract: The early detection of esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (EGJA) is crucial for improving patient prognosis, yet its current diagnosis is highly operator-dependent. This paper aims to make the first attempt to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) foundation model-based method for both screening and staging diagnosis of EGJA using endoscopic images. In this cohort and learning study, we conducted a multicentre study across seven Chinese hospitals between December 28, 2016 and December 30, 2024. It comprises 12,302 images from 1,546 patients; 8,249 of them were employed for model training, while the remaining were divided into the held-out (112 patients, 914 images), external (230 patients, 1,539 images), and prospective (198 patients, 1,600 images) test sets for evaluation. The proposed model employs DINOv2 (a vision foundation model) and ResNet50 (a convolutional neural network) to extract features of global appearance and local details of endoscopic images for EGJA staging diagnosis. Our model demonstrates satisfactory performance for EGJA staging diagnosis across three test sets, achieving an accuracy of 0.9256, 0.8895, and 0.8956, respectively. In contrast, among representative AI models, the best one (ResNet50) achieves an accuracy of 0.9125, 0.8382, and 0.8519 on the three test sets, respectively; the expert endoscopists achieve an accuracy of 0.8147 on the held-out test set. Moreover, with the assistance of our model, the overall accuracy for the trainee, competent, and expert endoscopists improves from 0.7035, 0.7350, and 0.8147 to 0.8497, 0.8521, and 0.8696, respectively. To our knowledge, our model is the first application of foundation models for EGJA staging diagnosis and demonstrates great potential in both diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: While vision language models (VLMs) excel in 2D semantic visual understanding, their ability to quantitatively reason about 3D spatial relationships remains under-explored, due to the deficiency of 2D images' spatial representation ability. In this paper, we analyze the problem hindering VLMs' spatial understanding abilities and propose SD-VLM, a novel framework that significantly enhances fundamental spatial perception abilities of VLMs through two key contributions: (1) propose Massive Spatial Measuring and Understanding (MSMU) dataset with precise spatial annotations, and (2) introduce a simple depth positional encoding method strengthening VLMs' spatial awareness. MSMU dataset covers massive quantitative spatial tasks with 700K QA pairs, 2.5M physical numerical annotations, and 10K chain-of-thought augmented samples. We have trained SD-VLM, a strong generalist VLM which shows superior quantitative spatial measuring and understanding capability. SD-VLM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on our proposed MSMU-Bench, but also shows spatial generalization abilities on other spatial understanding benchmarks including Q-Spatial and SpatialRGPT-Bench. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SD-VLM outperforms GPT-4o and Intern-VL3-78B by 26.91% and 25.56% respectively on MSMU-Bench. Code and models are released at https://github.com/cpystan/SD-VLM.

<title>Tailored Transformation Invariance for Industrial Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is a subproblem within Computer Vision Anomaly Detection that has been receiving increasing amounts of attention due to its applicability to real-life scenarios. Recent research has focused on how to extract the most informative features, contrasting older kNN-based methods that use only pretrained features. These recent methods are much more expensive to train however and could complicate real-life application. Careful study of related work with regards to transformation invariance leads to the idea that popular benchmarks require robustness to only minor translations. With this idea we then formulate LWinNN, a local window based approach that creates a middle ground between kNN based methods that have either complete or no translation invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this small change increases accuracy considerably, while simultaneously decreasing both train and test time. This teaches us two things: first, the gap between kNN-based approaches and more complex state-of-the-art methodology can still be narrowed by effective usage of the limited data available. Second, our assumption of requiring only limited translation invariance highlights potential areas of interest for future work and the need for more spatially diverse benchmarks, for which our method can hopefully serve as a new baseline. Our code can be found at https://github.com/marietteschonfeld/LWinNN .

Abstract: This paper evaluates DINOv3, a recent large-scale self-supervised vision backbone, for visuomotor diffusion policy learning in robotic manipulation. We investigate whether a purely self-supervised encoder can match or surpass conventional supervised ImageNet-pretrained backbones (e.g., ResNet-18) under three regimes: training from scratch, frozen, and finetuned. Across four benchmark tasks (Push-T, Lift, Can, Square) using a unified FiLM-conditioned diffusion policy, we find that (i) finetuned DINOv3 matches or exceeds ResNet-18 on several tasks, (ii) frozen DINOv3 remains competitive, indicating strong transferable priors, and (iii) self-supervised features improve sample efficiency and robustness. These results support self-supervised large visual models as effective, generalizable perceptual front-ends for action diffusion policies, motivating further exploration of scalable label-free pretraining in robotic manipulation. Compared to using ResNet18 as a backbone, our approach with DINOv3 achieves up to a 10% absolute increase in test-time success rates on challenging tasks such as Can, and on-the-par performance in tasks like Lift, PushT, and Square.

Abstract: Depth imaging is a crucial area in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), as it plays a key role in detecting and measuring objects in the vehicle's surroundings. However, a significant challenge in this domain arises from missing information in Depth images, where certain points are not measurable due to gaps or inconsistencies in pixel data. Our research addresses two key tasks to overcome this challenge. First, we developed an algorithm using a multi-layered training approach to generate Depth images from a single RGB image. Second, we addressed the issue of missing information in Depth images by applying our algorithm to rectify these gaps, resulting in Depth images with complete and accurate data. We further tested our algorithm on the Cityscapes dataset and successfully resolved the missing information in its Depth images, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in real-world urban environments.

<title>FROQ: Observing Face Recognition Models for Efficient Quality Assessment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17689</link>

arXiv:2509.17689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) plays a crucial role in many critical (high-stakes) applications, where errors in the recognition process can lead to serious consequences. Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) techniques enhance FR systems by providing quality estimates of face samples, enabling the systems to discard samples that are unsuitable for reliable recognition or lead to low-confidence recognition decisions. Most state-of-the-art FIQA techniques rely on extensive supervised training to achieve accurate quality estimation. In contrast, unsupervised techniques eliminate the need for additional training but tend to be slower and typically exhibit lower performance. In this paper, we introduce FROQ (Face Recognition Observer of Quality), a semi-supervised, training-free approach that leverages specific intermediate representations within a given FR model to estimate face-image quality, and combines the efficiency of supervised FIQA models with the training-free approach of unsupervised methods. A simple calibration step based on pseudo-quality labels allows FROQ to uncover specific representations, useful for quality assessment, in any modern FR model. To generate these pseudo-labels, we propose a novel unsupervised FIQA technique based on sample perturbations. Comprehensive experiments with four state-of-the-art FR models and eight benchmark datasets show that FROQ leads to highly competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art, achieving both strong performance and efficient runtime, without requiring explicit training.

Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems applied to new domains require an abundance of expensive, pixel-level dense labels to train robust semantic segmentation models under full supervision. This study proposes a model-agnostic Depth Edge Alignment Loss to improve Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation models across different datasets. The methodology generates pixel-level semantic labels from image-level supervision, avoiding expensive annotation processes. While weak supervision is widely explored in traditional computer vision, our approach adds supervision with pixel-level depth information, a modality commonly available in robotic systems. We demonstrate how our approach improves segmentation performance across datasets and models, but can also be combined with other losses for even better performance, with improvements up to +5.439, +1.274 and +16.416 points in mean Intersection over Union on the PASCAL VOC / MS COCO validation, and the HOPE static onboarding split, respectively. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) is a crucial technique in image processing, with a key challenge being the generation of decision maps with precise boundaries. However, traditional methods based on heuristic rules and deep learning methods with black-box mechanisms are difficult to generate high-quality decision maps. To overcome this challenge, we introduce neurodynamics-driven coupled neural P (CNP) systems, which are third-generation neural computation models inspired by spiking mechanisms, to enhance the accuracy of decision maps. Specifically, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the model's neurodynamics to identify the constraints between the network parameters and the input signals. This solid analysis avoids abnormal continuous firing of neurons and ensures the model accurately distinguishes between focused and unfocused regions, generating high-quality decision maps for MFIF. Based on this analysis, we propose a \textbf{N}eurodynamics-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{CNP} \textbf{F}usion model (\textbf{ND-CNPFuse}) tailored for the challenging MFIF task. Unlike current ideas of decision map generation, ND-CNPFuse distinguishes between focused and unfocused regions by mapping the source image into interpretable spike matrices. By comparing the number of spikes, an accurate decision map can be generated directly without any post-processing. Extensive experimental results show that ND-CNPFuse achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four classical MFIF datasets, including Lytro, MFFW, MFI-WHU, and Real-MFF. The code is available at https://github.com/MorvanLi/ND-CNPFuse.

Abstract: The standardisation of Intermodal Loading Units (ILUs), such as containers, semi-trailers and swap bodies, has revolutionised global trade yet their efficient and robust identification remains a critical bottleneck in high-throughput ports and terminals. This paper reviews 63 empirical studies that propose computer vision (CV) based solutions. It covers the last 35 years (1990-2025), tracing the field's evolution from early digital image processing (DIP) and traditional machine learning (ML) to the current dominance of deep learning (DL) techniques. While CV offers cost-effective alternatives for other types of identification techniques, its development is hindered by the lack of publicly available benchmarking datasets. This results in high variance for the reported results such as end-to-end accuracy ranging from 5 % to 96 %. Beyond dataset limitations, this review highlights the emerging challenges especially introduced by the shift from character-based text recognition to scene-text spotting and the integration of mobile cameras (e.g. drones, sensor equipped ground vehicles) for dynamic terminal monitoring. To advance the field, the paper calls for standardised terminology, open-access datasets, shared source code, while outlining future research directions such as contextless text recognition optimised for ISO6346 codes.

Abstract: Radar-camera fusion methods have emerged as a cost-effective approach for 3D object detection but still lag behind LiDAR-based methods in performance. Recent works have focused on employing temporal fusion and Knowledge Distillation (KD) strategies to overcome these limitations. However, existing approaches have not sufficiently accounted for uncertainties arising from object motion or sensor-specific errors inherent in radar and camera modalities. In this work, we propose RCTDistill, a novel cross-modal KD method based on temporal fusion, comprising three key modules: Range-Azimuth Knowledge Distillation (RAKD), Temporal Knowledge Distillation (TKD), and Region-Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (RDKD). RAKD is designed to consider the inherent errors in the range and azimuth directions, enabling effective knowledge transfer from LiDAR features to refine inaccurate BEV representations. TKD mitigates temporal misalignment caused by dynamic objects by aligning historical radar-camera BEV features with current LiDAR representations. RDKD enhances feature discrimination by distilling relational knowledge from the teacher model, allowing the student to differentiate foreground and background features. RCTDistill achieves state-of-the-art radar-camera fusion performance on both the nuScenes and View-of-Delft (VoD) datasets, with the fastest inference speed of 26.2 FPS.

Abstract: Accurate anatomical labeling of intracranial arteries is essential for cerebrovascular diagnosis and hemodynamic analysis but remains time-consuming and subject to interoperator variability. We present a deep learning-based framework for automated artery labeling from 3D Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography (3D ToF-MRA) segmentations (n=35), incorporating uncertainty quantification to enhance interpretability and reliability. We evaluated three convolutional neural network architectures: (1) a UNet with residual encoder blocks, reflecting commonly used baselines in vascular labeling; (2) CS-Net, an attention-augmented UNet incorporating channel and spatial attention mechanisms for enhanced curvilinear structure recognition; and (3) nnUNet, a self-configuring framework that automates preprocessing, training, and architectural adaptation based on dataset characteristics. Among these, nnUNet achieved the highest labeling performance (average Dice score: 0.922; average surface distance: 0.387 mm), with improved robustness in anatomically complex vessels. To assess predictive confidence, we implemented test-time augmentation (TTA) and introduced a novel coordinate-guided strategy to reduce interpolation errors during augmented inference. The resulting uncertainty maps reliably indicated regions of anatomical ambiguity, pathological variation, or manual labeling inconsistency. We further validated clinical utility by comparing flow velocities derived from automated and manual labels in co-registered 4D Flow MRI datasets, observing close agreement with no statistically significant differences. Our framework offers a scalable, accurate, and uncertainty-aware solution for automated cerebrovascular labeling, supporting downstream hemodynamic analysis and facilitating clinical integration.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in visual-textual reasoning, with Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting significantly enhancing interpretability. However, existing MCoT methods rely on rationale-rich datasets and largely focus on inter-object reasoning, overlooking the intra-object understanding crucial for image classification. To address this gap, we propose WISE, a Weak-supervision-guided Step-by-step Explanation method that augments any image classification dataset with MCoTs by reformulating the concept-based representations from Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) into concise, interpretable reasoning chains under weak supervision. Experiments across ten datasets show that our generated MCoTs not only improve interpretability by 37% but also lead to gains in classification accuracy when used to fine-tune MLLMs. Our work bridges concept-based interpretability and generative MCoT reasoning, providing a generalizable framework for enhancing MLLMs in fine-grained visual understanding.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating program workflows for visual tasks. However, previous approaches often rely on closed-source models, lack systematic reasoning, and struggle with long-form video question answering (videoQA). To address these challenges, we introduce the FS-VisPR framework, an adaptive visual program reasoning approach that balances fast reasoning for simple queries with slow reasoning for difficult ones. First, we design efficient visual modules (e.g., key clip retrieval and subtitle retrieval) to support long-form video tasks. Then, we construct a diverse and high-quality fast-slow reasoning dataset with a strong LLM to align open-source language models' ability to generate visual program workflows as FS-LLM. Next, we design a fast-slow reasoning framework with FS-LLM: Simple queries are directly solved by VideoLLMs, while difficult ones invoke visual program reasoning, motivated by human-like reasoning processes. During this process, low-confidence fast-thinking answers will trigger a second-stage slow-reasoning process, and a fallback mechanism to fast reasoning is activated if the program execution fails. Moreover, we improve visual programs through parameter search during both training and inference. By adjusting the parameters of the visual modules within the program, multiple variants are generated: during training, programs that yield correct answers are selected, while during inference, the program with the highest confidence result is applied. Experiments show that FS-VisPR improves both efficiency and reliability in visual program workflows. It achieves 50.4% accuracy on LVBench, surpassing GPT-4o, matching the performance of Qwen2.5VL-72B on VideoMME.

Abstract: Real-world datasets often exhibit class imbalance across multiple categories, manifesting as long-tailed distributions and few-shot scenarios. This is especially challenging in Class-Imbalanced Multi-Label Image Classification (CI-MLIC) tasks, where data imbalance and multi-object recognition present significant obstacles. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method termed Dual-View Alignment Learning with Hierarchical Prompt (HP-DVAL), which leverages multi-modal knowledge from vision-language pretrained (VLP) models to mitigate the class-imbalance problem in multi-label settings. Specifically, HP-DVAL employs dual-view alignment learning to transfer the powerful feature representation capabilities from VLP models by extracting complementary features for accurate image-text alignment. To better adapt VLP models for CI-MLIC tasks, we introduce a hierarchical prompt-tuning strategy that utilizes global and local prompts to learn task-specific and context-related prior knowledge. Additionally, we design a semantic consistency loss during prompt tuning to prevent learned prompts from deviating from general knowledge embedded in VLP models. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on two CI-MLIC benchmarks: MS-COCO and VOC2007. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over SOTA approaches, achieving mAP improvements of 10.0\% and 5.2\% on the long-tailed multi-label image classification task, and 6.8\% and 2.9\% on the multi-label few-shot image classification task.

Abstract: Amodal completion, generating invisible parts of occluded objects, is vital for applications like image editing and AR. Prior methods face challenges with data needs, generalization, or error accumulation in progressive pipelines. We propose a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework based on upfront collaborative reasoning to overcome these issues. Our framework uses multiple agents to collaboratively analyze occlusion relationships and determine necessary boundary expansion, yielding a precise mask for inpainting. Concurrently, an agent generates fine-grained textual descriptions, enabling Fine-Grained Semantic Guidance. This ensures accurate object synthesis and prevents the regeneration of occluders or other unwanted elements, especially within large inpainting areas. Furthermore, our method directly produces layered RGBA outputs guided by visible masks and attention maps from a Diffusion Transformer, eliminating extra segmentation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate our framework achieves state-of-the-art visual quality.

Abstract: This paper proposes Neural-MMGS, a novel neural 3DGS framework for multimodal large-scale scene reconstruction that fuses multiple sensing modalities in a per-gaussian compact, learnable embedding. While recent works focusing on large-scale scene reconstruction have incorporated LiDAR data to provide more accurate geometric constraints, we argue that LiDAR's rich physical properties remain underexplored. Similarly, semantic information has been used for object retrieval, but could provide valuable high-level context for scene reconstruction. Traditional approaches append these properties to Gaussians as separate parameters, increasing memory usage and limiting information exchange across modalities. Instead, our approach fuses all modalities -- image, LiDAR, and semantics -- into a compact, learnable embedding that implicitly encodes optical, physical, and semantic features in each Gaussian. We then train lightweight neural decoders to map these embeddings to Gaussian parameters, enabling the reconstruction of each sensing modality with lower memory overhead and improved scalability. We evaluate Neural-MMGS on the Oxford Spires and KITTI-360 datasets. On Oxford Spires, we achieve higher-quality reconstructions, while on KITTI-360, our method reaches competitive results with less storage consumption compared with current approaches in LiDAR-based novel-view synthesis.

<title>Incorporating the Refractory Period into Spiking Neural Networks through Spike-Triggered Threshold Dynamics</title>

Abstract: As the third generation of neural networks, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently gained widespread attention for their biological plausibility, energy efficiency, and effectiveness in processing neuromorphic datasets. To better emulate biological neurons, various models such as Integrate-and-Fire (IF) and Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) have been widely adopted in SNNs. However, these neuron models overlook the refractory period, a fundamental characteristic of biological neurons. Research on excitable neurons reveal that after firing, neurons enter a refractory period during which they are temporarily unresponsive to subsequent stimuli. This mechanism is critical for preventing over-excitation and mitigating interference from aberrant signals. Therefore, we propose a simple yet effective method to incorporate the refractory period into spiking LIF neurons through spike-triggered threshold dynamics, termed RPLIF. Our method ensures that each spike accurately encodes neural information, effectively preventing neuron over-excitation under continuous inputs and interference from anomalous inputs. Incorporating the refractory period into LIF neurons is seamless and computationally efficient, enhancing robustness and efficiency while yielding better performance with negligible overhead. To the best of our knowledge, RPLIF achieves state-of-the-art performance on Cifar10-DVS(82.40%) and N-Caltech101(83.35%) with fewer timesteps and demonstrates superior performance on DVS128 Gesture(97.22%) at low latency.

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-guided video generation (I2V) has raised concerns about its potential misuse in misinformation and fraud, underscoring the urgent need for effective digital watermarking. While existing watermarking methods demonstrate robustness within a single modality, they fail to trace source images in I2V settings. To address this gap, we introduce the concept of Robust Diffusion Distance, which measures the temporal persistence of watermark signals in generated videos. Building on this, we propose I2VWM, a cross-modal watermarking framework designed to enhance watermark robustness across time. I2VWM leverages a video-simulation noise layer during training and employs an optical-flow-based alignment module during inference. Experiments on both open-source and commercial I2V models demonstrate that I2VWM significantly improves robustness while maintaining imperceptibility, establishing a new paradigm for cross-modal watermarking in the era of generative video. \href{https://github.com/MrCrims/I2VWM-Robust-Watermarking-for-Image-to-Video-Generation}{Code Released.}

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenges associated with merging low-rank adaptations of large neural networks. With the rise of parameter-efficient adaptation techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), model fine-tuning has become more accessible. While fine-tuning models with LoRA is highly efficient, existing merging methods often sacrifice this efficiency by merging fully-sized weight matrices. We propose the Core Space merging framework, which enables the merging of LoRA-adapted models within a common alignment basis, thereby preserving the efficiency of low-rank adaptation while substantially improving accuracy across tasks. We further provide a formal proof that projection into Core Space ensures no loss of information and provide a complexity analysis showing the efficiency gains. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that Core Space significantly improves existing merging techniques and achieves state-of-the-art results on both vision and language tasks while utilizing a fraction of the computational resources.

<title>From Restoration to Reconstruction: Rethinking 3D Gaussian Splatting for Underwater Scenes</title>

Abstract: Underwater image degradation poses significant challenges for 3D reconstruction, where simplified physical models often fail in complex scenes. We propose \textbf{R-Splatting}, a unified framework that bridges underwater image restoration (UIR) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to improve both rendering quality and geometric fidelity. Our method integrates multiple enhanced views produced by diverse UIR models into a single reconstruction pipeline. During inference, a lightweight illumination generator samples latent codes to support diverse yet coherent renderings, while a contrastive loss ensures disentangled and stable illumination representations. Furthermore, we propose \textit{Uncertainty-Aware Opacity Optimization (UAOO)}, which models opacity as a stochastic function to regularize training. This suppresses abrupt gradient responses triggered by illumination variation and mitigates overfitting to noisy or view-specific artifacts. Experiments on Seathru-NeRF and our new BlueCoral3D dataset demonstrate that R-Splatting outperforms strong baselines in both rendering quality and geometric accuracy.

<title>Degradation-Aware All-in-One Image Restoration via Latent Prior Encoding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17792</link>

Abstract: Real-world images often suffer from spatially diverse degradations such as haze, rain, snow, and low-light, significantly impacting visual quality and downstream vision tasks. Existing all-in-one restoration (AIR) approaches either depend on external text prompts or embed hand-crafted architectural priors (e.g., frequency heuristics); both impose discrete, brittle assumptions that weaken generalization to unseen or mixed degradations. To address this limitation, we propose to reframe AIR as learned latent prior inference, where degradation-aware representations are automatically inferred from the input without explicit task cues. Based on latent priors, we formulate AIR as a structured reasoning paradigm: (1) which features to route (adaptive feature selection), (2) where to restore (spatial localization), and (3) what to restore (degradation semantics). We design a lightweight decoding module that efficiently leverages these latent encoded cues for spatially-adaptive restoration. Extensive experiments across six common degradation tasks, five compound settings, and previously unseen degradations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, achieving an average PSNR improvement of 1.68 dB while being three times more efficient.

<title>TS-P$^2$CL: Plug-and-Play Dual Contrastive Learning for Vision-Guided Medical Time Series Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17802</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17802</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.17802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical time series (MedTS) classification is pivotal for intelligent healthcare, yet its efficacy is severely limited by poor cross-subject generation due to the profound cross-individual heterogeneity. Despite advances in architectural innovations and transfer learning techniques, current methods remain constrained by modality-specific inductive biases that limit their ability to learn universally invariant representations. To overcome this, we propose TS-P$^2$CL, a novel plug-and-play framework that leverages the universal pattern recognition capabilities of pre-trained vision models. We introduce a vision-guided paradigm that transforms 1D physiological signals into 2D pseudo-images, establishing a bridge to the visual domain. This transformation enables implicit access to rich semantic priors learned from natural images. Within this unified space, we employ a dual-contrastive learning strategy: intra-modal consistency enforces temporal coherence, while cross-modal alignment aligns time-series dynamics with visual semantics, thereby mitigating individual-specific biases and learning robust, domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments on six MedTS datasets demonstrate that TS-P$^2$CL consistently outperforms fourteen methods in both subject-dependent and subject-independent settings.

<title>Selecting Optimal Camera Views for Gait Analysis: A Multi-Metric Assessment of 2D Projections</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17805</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.17805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To systematically quantify the effect of the camera view (frontal vs. lateral) on the accuracy of 2D markerless gait analysis relative to 3D motion capture ground truth. Methods: Gait data from 18 subjects were recorded simultaneously using frontal, lateral and 3D motion capture systems. Pose estimation used YOLOv8. Four metrics were assessed to evaluate agreement: Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for temporal alignment, Maximum Cross-Correlation (MCC) for signal similarity, Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) for distribution differences, and Information Entropy (IE) for complexity. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (significance: $p < 0.05$) and Cliff's delta ($\delta$) were used to measure statistical differences and effect sizes. Results: Lateral views significantly outperformed frontal views for sagittal plane kinematics: step length (DTW: $53.08 \pm 24.50$ vs. $69.87 \pm 25.36$, $p = 0.005$) and knee rotation (DTW: $106.46 \pm 38.57$ vs. $155.41 \pm 41.77$, $p = 0.004$). Frontal views were superior for symmetry parameters: trunk rotation (KLD: $0.09 \pm 0.06$ vs. $0.30 \pm 0.19$, $p < 0.001$) and wrist-to-hipmid distance (MCC: $105.77 \pm 29.72$ vs. $75.20 \pm 20.38$, $p = 0.003$). Effect sizes were medium-to-large ($\delta: 0.34$--$0.76$). Conclusion: Camera view critically impacts gait parameter accuracy. Lateral views are optimal for sagittal kinematics; frontal views excel for trunk symmetry. Significance: This first systematic evidence enables data-driven camera deployment in 2D gait analysis, enhancing clinical utility. Future implementations should leverage both views via disease-oriented setups.

<title>Enhancing Semantic Segmentation with Continual Self-Supervised Pre-training</title>

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a central paradigm for training foundation models by leveraging large-scale unlabeled datasets, often producing representations with strong generalization capabilities. These models are typically pre-trained on general-purpose datasets such as ImageNet and subsequently adapted to various downstream tasks through finetuning. While recent advances have explored parameter-efficient strategies for adapting pre-trained models, extending SSL pre-training itself to new domains - particularly under limited data regimes and for dense prediction tasks - remains underexplored. In this work, we address the problem of adapting vision foundation models to new domains in an unsupervised and data-efficient manner, specifically targeting downstream semantic segmentation. We propose GLARE (Global Local and Regional Enforcement), a novel continual self-supervised pre-training task designed to enhance downstream segmentation performance. GLARE introduces patch-level augmentations to encourage local consistency and incorporates a regional consistency constraint that leverages spatial semantics in the data. For efficient continual pre-training, we initialize Vision Transformers (ViTs) with weights from existing SSL models and update only lightweight adapter modules - specifically UniAdapter - while keeping the rest of the backbone frozen. Experiments across multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks on different domains demonstrate that GLARE consistently improves downstream performance with minimal computational and parameter overhead.

<title>ContextFlow: Training-Free Video Object Editing via Adaptive Context Enrichment</title>

Abstract: Training-free video object editing aims to achieve precise object-level manipulation, including object insertion, swapping, and deletion. However, it faces significant challenges in maintaining fidelity and temporal consistency. Existing methods, often designed for U-Net architectures, suffer from two primary limitations: inaccurate inversion due to first-order solvers, and contextual conflicts caused by crude "hard" feature replacement. These issues are more challenging in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), where the unsuitability of prior layer-selection heuristics makes effective guidance challenging. To address these limitations, we introduce ContextFlow, a novel training-free framework for DiT-based video object editing. In detail, we first employ a high-order Rectified Flow solver to establish a robust editing foundation. The core of our framework is Adaptive Context Enrichment (for specifying what to edit), a mechanism that addresses contextual conflicts. Instead of replacing features, it enriches the self-attention context by concatenating Key-Value pairs from parallel reconstruction and editing paths, empowering the model to dynamically fuse information. Additionally, to determine where to apply this enrichment (for specifying where to edit), we propose a systematic, data-driven analysis to identify task-specific vital layers. Based on a novel Guidance Responsiveness Metric, our method pinpoints the most influential DiT blocks for different tasks (e.g., insertion, swapping), enabling targeted and highly effective guidance. Extensive experiments show that ContextFlow significantly outperforms existing training-free methods and even surpasses several state-of-the-art training-based approaches, delivering temporally coherent, high-fidelity results.

<title>Semantic and Visual Crop-Guided Diffusion Models for Heterogeneous Tissue Synthesis in Histopathology</title>

Abstract: Synthetic data generation in histopathology faces unique challenges: preserving tissue heterogeneity, capturing subtle morphological features, and scaling to unannotated datasets. We present a latent diffusion model that generates realistic heterogeneous histopathology images through a novel dual-conditioning approach combining semantic segmentation maps with tissue-specific visual crops. Unlike existing methods that rely on text prompts or abstract visual embeddings, our approach preserves critical morphological details by directly incorporating raw tissue crops from corresponding semantic regions. For annotated datasets (i.e., Camelyon16, Panda), we extract patches ensuring 20-80% tissue heterogeneity. For unannotated data (i.e., TCGA), we introduce a self-supervised extension that clusters whole-slide images into 100 tissue types using foundation model embeddings, automatically generating pseudo-semantic maps for training. Our method synthesizes high-fidelity images with precise region-wise annotations, achieving superior performance on downstream segmentation tasks. When evaluated on annotated datasets, models trained on our synthetic data show competitive performance to those trained on real data, demonstrating the utility of controlled heterogeneous tissue generation. In quantitative evaluation, prompt-guided synthesis reduces Frechet Distance by up to 6X on Camelyon16 (from 430.1 to 72.0) and yields 2-3x lower FD across Panda and TCGA. Downstream DeepLabv3+ models trained solely on synthetic data attain test IoU of 0.71 and 0.95 on Camelyon16 and Panda, within 1-2% of real-data baselines (0.72 and 0.96). By scaling to 11,765 TCGA whole-slide images without manual annotations, our framework offers a practical solution for an urgent need for generating diverse, annotated histopathology data, addressing a critical bottleneck in computational pathology.

Abstract: Achieving truly practical dynamic 3D reconstruction requires online operation, global pose and map consistency, detailed appearance modeling, and the flexibility to handle both RGB and RGB-D inputs. However, existing SLAM methods typically merely remove the dynamic parts or require RGB-D input, while offline methods are not scalable to long video sequences, and current transformer-based feedforward methods lack global consistency and appearance details. To this end, we achieve online dynamic scene reconstruction by disentangling the static and dynamic parts within a SLAM system. The poses are tracked robustly with a novel motion masking strategy, and dynamic parts are reconstructed leveraging a progressive adaptation of a Motion Scaffolds graph. Our method yields novel view renderings competitive to offline methods and achieves on-par tracking with state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods.

<title>Trainee Action Recognition through Interaction Analysis in CCATT Mixed-Reality Training</title>

Abstract: This study examines how Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT) members are trained using mixed-reality simulations that replicate the high-pressure conditions of aeromedical evacuation. Each team - a physician, nurse, and respiratory therapist - must stabilize severely injured soldiers by managing ventilators, IV pumps, and suction devices during flight. Proficient performance requires clinical expertise and cognitive skills, such as situational awareness, rapid decision-making, effective communication, and coordinated task management, all of which must be maintained under stress. Recent advances in simulation and multimodal data analytics enable more objective and comprehensive performance evaluation. In contrast, traditional instructor-led assessments are subjective and may overlook critical events, thereby limiting generalizability and consistency. However, AI-based automated and more objective evaluation metrics still demand human input to train the AI algorithms to assess complex team dynamics in the presence of environmental noise and the need for accurate re-identification in multi-person tracking. To address these challenges, we introduce a systematic, data-driven assessment framework that combines Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) with Multimodal Learning Analytics (MMLA). We have developed a domain-specific CTA model for CCATT training and a vision-based action recognition pipeline using a fine-tuned Human-Object Interaction model, the Cascade Disentangling Network (CDN), to detect and track trainee-equipment interactions over time. These interactions automatically yield performance indicators (e.g., reaction time, task duration), which are mapped onto a hierarchical CTA model tailored to CCATT operations, enabling interpretable, domain-relevant performance evaluations.

Abstract: Modern multimodal large language models often claim "video understanding," yet most evaluations use muted videos or simply discard audio. We ask a direct question: how much does audio actually matter for contemporary Video-LLMs and the benchmarks that certify them? We audit widely used suites and observe that many items are even solvable from a single frame, rendering audio largely redundant. Building on LLaVA-OneVision architecture, we attach a speech/audio encoder (e.g., Whisper) and analyze when audio helps, while addressing audio token explosion with a lightweight Mamba-based state-space token compressor. We find that audio yields minimal gains on recent video benchmarks but is decisive on curated, audio-sensitive subsets. To enable faithful evaluation, we release AVQA-Hard and Music-AVQA-Hard, our model, and code. Our findings surface a growing gap between current academic practice and real-world expectations, and provide practical tools for scalable audio-visual Video-LLMs. We will fully open-source our work at https://github.com/naver-ai/LLaVA-AV-SSM.

<title>SmaRT: Style-Modulated Robust Test-Time Adaptation for Cross-Domain Brain Tumor Segmentation in MRI</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Reliable brain tumor segmentation in MRI is indispensable for treatment planning and outcome monitoring, yet models trained on curated benchmarks often fail under domain shifts arising from scanner and protocol variability as well as population heterogeneity. Such gaps are especially severe in low-resource and pediatric cohorts, where conventional test-time or source-free adaptation strategies often suffer from instability and structural inconsistency. We propose SmaRT, a style-modulated robust test-time adaptation framework that enables source-free cross-domain generalization. SmaRT integrates style-aware augmentation to mitigate appearance discrepancies, a dual-branch momentum strategy for stable pseudo-label refinement, and structural priors enforcing consistency, integrity, and connectivity. This synergy ensures both adaptation stability and anatomical fidelity under extreme domain shifts. Extensive evaluations on sub-Saharan Africa and pediatric glioma datasets show that SmaRT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with notable gains in Dice accuracy and boundary precision. Overall, SmaRT bridges the gap between algorithmic advances and equitable clinical applicability, supporting robust deployment of MRI-based neuro-oncology tools in diverse clinical environments.

<title>Multi-needle Localization for Pelvic Seed Implant Brachytherapy based on Tip-handle Detection and Matching</title>

arXiv:2509.17931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate multi-needle localization in intraoperative CT images is crucial for optimizing seed placement in pelvic seed implant brachytherapy. However, this task is challenging due to poor image contrast and needle adhesion. This paper presents a novel approach that reframes needle localization as a tip-handle detection and matching problem to overcome these difficulties. An anchor-free network, based on HRNet, is proposed to extract multi-scale features and accurately detect needle tips and handles by predicting their centers and orientations using decoupled branches for heatmap regression and polar angle prediction. To associate detected tips and handles into individual needles, a greedy matching and merging (GMM) method designed to solve the unbalanced assignment problem with constraints (UAP-C) is presented. The GMM method iteratively selects the most probable tip-handle pairs and merges them based on a distance metric to reconstruct 3D needle paths. Evaluated on a dataset of 100 patients, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher precision and F1 score compared to a segmentation-based method utilizing the nnUNet model,thereby offering a more robust and accurate solution for needle localization in complex clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Combining multimodal data is a key issue in a wide range of machine learning tasks, including many remote sensing problems. In Earth observation, early multimodal data fusion methods were based on specific neural network architectures and supervised learning. Ever since, the scarcity of labeled data has motivated self-supervised learning techniques. State-of-the-art multimodal representation learning techniques leverage the spatial alignment between satellite data from different modalities acquired over the same geographic area in order to foster a semantic alignment in the latent space. In this paper, we investigate how this methods can preserve task-relevant information that is not shared across modalities. First, we show, under simplifying assumptions, when alignment strategies fundamentally lead to an information loss. Then, we support our theoretical insight through numerical experiments in more realistic settings. With those theoretical and empirical evidences, we hope to support new developments in contrastive learning for the combination of multimodal satellite data. Our code and data is publicly available at https://github.com/Romain3Ch216/alg_maclean_25.

<title>DragOSM: Extract Building Roofs and Footprints from Aerial Images by Aligning Historical Labels</title>

Abstract: Extracting polygonal roofs and footprints from remote sensing images is critical for large-scale urban analysis. Most existing methods rely on segmentation-based models that assume clear semantic boundaries of roofs, but these approaches struggle in off- nadir images, where the roof and footprint are significantly displaced, and facade pixels are fused with the roof boundary. With the increasing availability of open vector map annotations, e.g., OpenStreetMap, utilizing historical labels for off-nadir image annotation has become viable because remote sensing images are georeferenced once captured. However, these historical labels commonly suffer from significant positional discrepancies with new images and only have one annotation (roof or footprint), which fails to describe the correct structures of a building. To address these discrepancies, we first introduce a concept of an alignment token, which encodes the correction vector to guide the label correction. Based on this concept, we then propose Drag OpenStreetMap Labels (DragOSM), a novel model designed to align dislocated historical labels with roofs and footprints. Specifically, DragOSM formulates the label alignment as an interactive denoising process, modeling the positional discrepancy as a Gaussian distribution. During training, it learns to correct these errors by simulating misalignment with random Gaussian perturbations; during inference, it iteratively refines the positions of input labels. To validate our method, we further present a new dataset, Repairing Buildings in OSM (ReBO), comprising 179,265 buildings with both OpenStreetMap and manually corrected annotations across 5,473 images from 41 cities. Experimental results on ReBO demonstrate the effectiveness of DragOSM. Code, dataset, and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/likaiucas/DragOSM.git.

Abstract: The modeling of complicated time-evolving physical dynamics from partial observations is a long-standing challenge. Particularly, observations can be sparsely distributed in a seemingly random or unstructured manner, making it difficult to capture highly nonlinear features in a variety of scientific and engineering problems. However, existing data-driven approaches are often constrained by fixed spatial and temporal discretization. While some researchers attempt to achieve spatio-temporal continuity by designing novel strategies, they either overly rely on traditional numerical methods or fail to truly overcome the limitations imposed by discretization. To address these, we propose CoPS, a purely data-driven methods, to effectively model continuous physics simulation from partial observations. Specifically, we employ multiplicative filter network to fuse and encode spatial information with the corresponding observations. Then we customize geometric grids and use message-passing mechanism to map features from original spatial domain to the customized grids. Subsequently, CoPS models continuous-time dynamics by designing multi-scale graph ODEs, while introducing a Markov-based neural auto-correction module to assist and constrain the continuous extrapolations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS advances the state-of-the-art methods in space-time continuous modeling across various scenarios.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful, yet their high complexity greatly limits their potential to be deployed on billions of resource-constrained edge devices. Pruning is a crucial network compression technique, yet most existing methods focus on classification models, with limited attention to detection. Even among those addressing detection, there is a lack of utilization of essential localization information. Also, many pruning methods passively rely on pre-trained models, in which useful and useless components are intertwined, making it difficult to remove the latter without harming the former at the neuron/filter level. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a proactive detection-discriminants-based network compression approach for deep visual detectors, which alternates between two steps: (1) maximizing and compressing detection-related discriminants and aligning them with a subset of neurons/filters immediately before the detection head, and (2) tracing the detection-related discriminating power across the layers and discarding features of lower importance. Object location information is exploited in both steps. Extensive experiments, employing four advanced detection models and four state-of-the-art competing methods on the KITTI and COCO datasets, highlight the superiority of our approach. Remarkably, our compressed models can even beat the original base models with a substantial reduction in complexity.

Abstract: The advancement of diffusion models has enhanced the realism of AI-generated content but also raised concerns about misuse, necessitating robust copyright protection and tampering localization. Although recent methods have made progress toward unified solutions, their reliance on post hoc processing introduces considerable application inconvenience and compromises forensic reliability. We propose StableGuard, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates a binary watermark into the diffusion generation process, ensuring copyright protection and tampering localization in Latent Diffusion Models through an end-to-end design. We develop a Multiplexing Watermark VAE (MPW-VAE) by equipping a pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a lightweight latent residual-based adapter, enabling the generation of paired watermarked and watermark-free images. These pairs, fused via random masks, create a diverse dataset for training a tampering-agnostic forensic network. To further enhance forensic synergy, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts Guided Forensic Network (MoE-GFN) that dynamically integrates holistic watermark patterns, local tampering traces, and frequency-domain cues for precise watermark verification and tampered region detection. The MPW-VAE and MoE-GFN are jointly optimized in a self-supervised, end-to-end manner, fostering a reciprocal training between watermark embedding and forensic accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StableGuard consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in image fidelity, watermark verification, and tampering localization.

Abstract: Recent work has shown promising performance of frontier large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal counterparts in medical quizzes and diagnostic tasks, highlighting their potential for broad clinical utility given their accessible, general-purpose nature. However, beyond diagnosis, a fundamental aspect of medical image interpretation is the ability to localize pathological findings. Evaluating localization not only has clinical and educational relevance but also provides insight into a model's spatial understanding of anatomy and disease. Here, we systematically assess two general-purpose MLLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-5) and a domain-specific model (MedGemma) in their ability to localize pathologies on chest radiographs, using a prompting pipeline that overlays a spatial grid and elicits coordinate-based predictions. Averaged across nine pathologies in the CheXlocalize dataset, GPT-5 exhibited a localization accuracy of 49.7%, followed by GPT-4 (39.1%) and MedGemma (17.7%), all lower than a task-specific CNN baseline (59.9%) and a radiologist benchmark (80.1%). Despite modest performance, error analysis revealed that GPT-5's predictions were largely in anatomically plausible regions, just not always precisely localized. GPT-4 performed well on pathologies with fixed anatomical locations, but struggled with spatially variable findings and exhibited anatomically implausible predictions more frequently. MedGemma demonstrated the lowest performance on all pathologies, showing limited capacity to generalize to this novel task. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current MLLMs in medical imaging and underscore the importance of integrating them with task-specific tools for reliable use.

<title>NeuS-QA: Grounding Long-Form Video Understanding in Temporal Logic and Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Long-Form Video Question Answering (LVQA) poses challenges beyond traditional visual question answering (VQA), which is often limited to static images or short video clips. While current vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in those settings, they struggle with complex queries in LVQA over long videos involving multi-step temporal reasoning and causality. Vanilla approaches, which sample frames uniformly and feed them to a VLM with the question, incur significant token overhead, forcing severe downsampling. As a result, the model often misses fine-grained visual structure, subtle event transitions, or key temporal cues, ultimately leading to incorrect answers. To address these limitations, recent works have explored query-adaptive frame sampling, hierarchical keyframe selection, and agent-based iterative querying. However, these methods remain fundamentally heuristic: they lack explicit temporal representations and cannot enforce or verify logical event relationships. As a result, there are no formal guarantees that the sampled context actually encodes the compositional or causal logic demanded by the question. To address these foundational gaps, we introduce NeuS-QA, a training-free, plug-and-play neuro-symbolic pipeline for LVQA. NeuS-QA translates a natural language question into a formal temporal logic expression, constructs a video automaton from frame-level semantic propositions, and applies model checking to rigorously identify video segments satisfying the question's logical requirements. Only these logic-verified segments are submitted to the VLM, thus improving interpretability, reducing hallucinations, and enabling compositional reasoning without modifying or fine-tuning the model. Experiments on LongVideoBench and CinePile show NeuS-QA improves performance by over 10%, especially on questions involving event ordering, causality, and multi-step compositional reasoning.

<title>TempSamp-R1: Effective Temporal Sampling with Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Video LLMs</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces TempSamp-R1, a new reinforcement fine-tuning framework designed to improve the effectiveness of adapting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to video temporal grounding tasks. We reveal that existing reinforcement learning methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), rely on on-policy sampling for policy updates. However, in tasks with large temporal search spaces, this strategy becomes both inefficient and limited in performance, as it often fails to identify temporally accurate solutions. To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth annotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance, effectively compensating for the sparsity and misalignment in on-policy solutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based updates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method that dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation. By employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1 optimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference modes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TempSamp-R1 outperforms GRPO-based baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets: Charades-STA (R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%), ActivityNet Captions (R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%), and QVHighlights (mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%). Moreover, TempSamp-R1 shows robust few-shot generalization capabilities under limited data. Code: https://github.com/HVision-NKU/TempSamp-R1

Abstract: Despite Bengali being the sixth most spoken language in the world, handwritten text recognition (HTR) systems for Bengali remain severely underdeveloped. The complexity of Bengali script--featuring conjuncts, diacritics, and highly variable handwriting styles--combined with a scarcity of annotated datasets makes this task particularly challenging. We present GraDeT-HTR, a resource-efficient Bengali handwritten text recognition system based on a Grapheme-aware Decoder-only Transformer architecture. To address the unique challenges of Bengali script, we augment the performance of a decoder-only transformer by integrating a grapheme-based tokenizer and demonstrate that it significantly improves recognition accuracy compared to conventional subword tokenizers. Our model is pretrained on large-scale synthetic data and fine-tuned on real human-annotated samples, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate surfaces with radiance fields has achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, prevailing approaches, primarily based on Gaussian Splatting, are increasingly constrained by representational bottlenecks. In this paper, we introduce GeoSVR, an explicit voxel-based framework that explores and extends the under-investigated potential of sparse voxels for achieving accurate, detailed, and complete surface reconstruction. As strengths, sparse voxels support preserving the coverage completeness and geometric clarity, while corresponding challenges also arise from absent scene constraints and locality in surface refinement. To ensure correct scene convergence, we first propose a Voxel-Uncertainty Depth Constraint that maximizes the effect of monocular depth cues while presenting a voxel-oriented uncertainty to avoid quality degradation, enabling effective and robust scene constraints yet preserving highly accurate geometries. Subsequently, Sparse Voxel Surface Regularization is designed to enhance geometric consistency for tiny voxels and facilitate the voxel-based formation of sharp and accurate surfaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance compared to existing methods across diverse challenging scenarios, excelling in geometric accuracy, detail preservation, and reconstruction completeness while maintaining high efficiency.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity images of humans with fine-grained control over attributes such as hairstyle and clothing remains a core challenge in personalized text-to-image synthesis. While prior methods emphasize identity preservation from a reference image, they lack modularity and fail to provide disentangled control over specific visual attributes. We introduce a new paradigm for attribute-specific image prompting, in which distinct sets of reference images are used to guide the generation of individual aspects of human appearance, such as hair, clothing, and identity. Our method encodes these inputs into attribute-specific tokens, which are injected into a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. This enables compositional and disentangled control over multiple visual factors, even across multiple people within a single image. To promote natural composition and robust disentanglement, we curate a cross-reference training dataset featuring subjects in diverse poses and expressions, and propose a multi-attribute cross-reference training strategy that encourages the model to generate faithful outputs from misaligned attribute inputs while adhering to both identity and textual conditioning. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in accurately following both visual and textual prompts. Our framework paves the way for more configurable human image synthesis by combining visual prompting with text-driven generation. Webpage is available at: https://snap-research.github.io/composeme/.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated their remarkable success as general-purpose multi-modal assistants, with particular focuses on holistic image- and video-language understanding. Conversely, less attention has been given to scaling fine-grained pixel-level understanding capabilities, where the models are expected to realize pixel-level alignment between visual signals and language semantics. Some previous studies have applied LMMs to related tasks such as region-level captioning and referring expression segmentation. However, these models are limited to performing either referring or segmentation tasks independently and fail to integrate these fine-grained perception capabilities into visual reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose UniPixel, a large multi-modal model capable of flexibly comprehending visual prompt inputs and generating mask-grounded responses. Our model distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating pixel-level perception with general visual understanding capabilities. Specifically, UniPixel processes visual prompts and generates relevant masks on demand, and performs subsequent reasoning conditioning on these intermediate pointers during inference, thereby enabling fine-grained pixel-level reasoning. The effectiveness of our approach has been verified on 10 benchmarks across a diverse set of tasks, including pixel-level referring/segmentation and object-centric understanding in images/videos. A novel PixelQA task that jointly requires referring, segmentation, and question answering is also designed to verify the flexibility of our method.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at translating language prompts into photorealistic images by implicitly grounding textual concepts through their cross-modal attention mechanisms. Recent multi-modal diffusion transformers extend this by introducing joint self-attention over concatenated image and text tokens, enabling richer and more scalable cross-modal alignment. However, a detailed understanding of how and where these attention maps contribute to image generation remains limited. In this paper, we introduce Seg4Diff (Segmentation for Diffusion), a systematic framework for analyzing the attention structures of MM-DiT, with a focus on how specific layers propagate semantic information from text to image. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify a semantic grounding expert layer, a specific MM-DiT block that consistently aligns text tokens with spatially coherent image regions, naturally producing high-quality semantic segmentation masks. We further demonstrate that applying a lightweight fine-tuning scheme with mask-annotated image data enhances the semantic grouping capabilities of these layers and thereby improves both segmentation performance and generated image fidelity. Our findings demonstrate that semantic grouping is an emergent property of diffusion transformers and can be selectively amplified to advance both segmentation and generation performance, paving the way for unified models that bridge visual perception and generation.

Abstract: Dynamic surface reconstruction of objects from point cloud sequences is a challenging field in computer graphics. Existing approaches either require multiple regularization terms or extensive training data which, however, lead to compromises in reconstruction accuracy as well as over-smoothing or poor generalization to unseen objects and motions. To address these lim- itations, we introduce Preconditioned Deformation Grids, a novel technique for estimating coherent deformation fields directly from unstructured point cloud sequences without requiring or forming explicit correspondences. Key to our approach is the use of multi-resolution voxel grids that capture the overall motion at varying spatial scales, enabling a more flexible deformation representation. In conjunction with incorporating grid-based Sobolev preconditioning into gradient-based optimization, we show that applying a Chamfer loss between the input point clouds as well as to an evolving template mesh is sufficient to obtain accurate deformations. To ensure temporal consistency along the object surface, we include a weak isometry loss on mesh edges which complements the main objective without constraining deformation fidelity. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior results, particularly for long sequences, compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: Frequency-modulated continuous wave radars have gained increasing popularity in the automotive industry. Its robustness against adverse weather conditions makes it a suitable choice for radar object detection in advanced driver assistance systems. These real-time embedded systems have requirements for the compactness and efficiency of the model, which have been largely overlooked in previous work. In this work, we propose mRadNet, a novel radar object detection model with compactness in mind. mRadNet employs a U-net style architecture with MetaFormer blocks, in which separable convolution and attention token mixers are used to capture both local and global features effectively. More efficient token embedding and merging strategies are introduced to further facilitate the lightweight design of the model. The performance of mRadNet is validated on the CRUW dataset, improving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection through Pap smear analysis is critical to improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality of Cervical cancer. State-of-the-art (SOTA) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) require substantial computational resources, extended training time, and large datasets. In this study, a lightweight CNN model, S-Net (Simple Net), is developed specifically for cervical cancer detection and classification using Pap smear images to address these limitations. Alongside S-Net, six SOTA CNNs were evaluated using transfer learning, including multi-path (DenseNet201, ResNet152), depth-based (Serasnet152), width-based multi-connection (Xception), depth-wise separable convolutions (MobileNetV2), and spatial exploitation-based (VGG19). All models, including S-Net, achieved comparable accuracy, with S-Net reaching 99.99%. However, S-Net significantly outperforms the SOTA CNNs in terms of computational efficiency and inference time, making it a more practical choice for real-time and resource-constrained applications. A major limitation in CNN-based medical diagnosis remains the lack of transparency in the decision-making process. To address this, Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM, were employed to visualize and interpret the key image regions influencing model predictions. The novelty of this study lies in the development of a highly accurate yet computationally lightweight model (S-Net) caPable of rapid inference while maintaining interpretability through XAI integration. Furthermore, this work analyzes the behavior of SOTA CNNs, investigates the effects of negative transfer learning on Pap smear images, and examines pixel intensity patterns in correctly and incorrectly classified samples.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are criticized for their extensive computational power, long training times, and large datasets. To overcome this limitation, we propose a reasonable network (R-Net), a lightweight CNN only to detect and classify colorectal cancer (CRC) using the Enteroscope Biopsy Histopathological Hematoxylin and Eosin Image Dataset (EBHI). Furthermore, six SOTA CNNs, including Multipath-based CNNs (DenseNet121, ResNet50), Depth-based CNNs (InceptionV3), width-based multi-connection CNNs (Xception), depth-wise separable convolutions (MobileNetV2), spatial exploitation-based CNNs (VGG16), Transfer learning, and two ensemble models are also tested on the same dataset. The ensemble models are a multipath-depth-width combination (DenseNet121-InceptionV3-Xception) and a multipath-depth-spatial combination (ResNet18-InceptionV3-VGG16). However, the proposed R-Net lightweight achieved 99.37% accuracy, outperforming MobileNet (95.83%) and ResNet50 (96.94%). Most importantly, to understand the decision-making of R-Net, Explainable AI such as SHAP, LIME, and Grad-CAM are integrated to visualize which parts of the EBHI image contribute to the detection and classification process of R-Net. The main novelty of this research lies in building a reliable, lightweight CNN R-Net that requires fewer computing resources yet maintains strong prediction results. SOTA CNNs, transfer learning, and ensemble models also extend our knowledge on CRC classification and detection. XAI functionality and the impact of pixel intensity on correct and incorrect classification images are also some novelties in CRC detection and classification.

Abstract: Medical domain automated text generation is an active area of research and development; however, evaluating the clinical quality of generated reports remains a challenge, especially in instances where domain-specific metrics are lacking, e.g. histopathology. We propose HARE (Histopathology Automated Report Evaluation), a novel entity and relation centric framework, composed of a benchmark dataset, a named entity recognition (NER) model, a relation extraction (RE) model, and a novel metric, which prioritizes clinically relevant content by aligning critical histopathology entities and relations between reference and generated reports. To develop the HARE benchmark, we annotated 813 de-identified clinical diagnostic histopathology reports and 652 histopathology reports from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) with domain-specific entities and relations. We fine-tuned GatorTronS, a domain-adapted language model to develop HARE-NER and HARE-RE which achieved the highest overall F1-score (0.915) among the tested models. The proposed HARE metric outperformed traditional metrics including ROUGE and Meteor, as well as radiology metrics such as RadGraph-XL, with the highest correlation and the best regression to expert evaluations (higher than the second best method, GREEN, a large language model based radiology report evaluator, by Pearson $r = 0.168$, Spearman $\rho = 0.161$, Kendall $\tau = 0.123$, $R^2 = 0.176$, $RMSE = 0.018$). We release HARE, datasets, and the models at https://github.com/knowlab/HARE to foster advancements in histopathology report generation, providing a robust framework for improving the quality of reports.

Abstract: Learning editable high-resolution scene representations for dynamic scenes is an open problem with applications across the domains from autonomous driving to creative editing - the most successful approaches today make a trade-off between editability and supporting scene complexity: neural atlases represent dynamic scenes as two deforming image layers, foreground and background, which are editable in 2D, but break down when multiple objects occlude and interact. In contrast, scene graph models make use of annotated data such as masks and bounding boxes from autonomous-driving datasets to capture complex 3D spatial relationships, but their implicit volumetric node representations are challenging to edit view-consistently. We propose Neural Atlas Graphs (NAGs), a hybrid high-resolution scene representation, where every graph node is a view-dependent neural atlas, facilitating both 2D appearance editing and 3D ordering and positioning of scene elements. Fit at test-time, NAGs achieve state-of-the-art quantitative results on the Waymo Open Dataset - by 5 dB PSNR increase compared to existing methods - and make environmental editing possible in high resolution and visual quality - creating counterfactual driving scenarios with new backgrounds and edited vehicle appearance. We find that the method also generalizes beyond driving scenes and compares favorably - by more than 7 dB in PSNR - to recent matting and video editing baselines on the DAVIS video dataset with a diverse set of human and animal-centric scenes.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific "forget" data from a trained model while preserving its knowledge of the remaining "retain" data. Existing MU methods based on label manipulation or model weight perturbations often achieve limited unlearning effectiveness. To address this, we introduce CoUn, a novel MU framework inspired by the observation that a model retrained from scratch using only retain data classifies forget data based on their semantic similarity to the retain data. CoUn emulates this behavior by adjusting learned data representations through contrastive learning (CL) and supervised learning, applied exclusively to retain data. Specifically, CoUn (1) leverages semantic similarity between data samples to indirectly adjust forget representations using CL, and (2) maintains retain representations within their respective clusters through supervised learning. Extensive experiments across various datasets and model architectures show that CoUn consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MU baselines in unlearning effectiveness. Additionally, integrating our CL module into existing baselines empowers their unlearning effectiveness.

Abstract: With society's increasing reliance on digital data sharing, the protection of sensitive information has become critical. Encryption serves as one of the privacy-preserving methods; however, its realization in the audio domain predominantly relies on signal processing or software methods embedded into hardware. In this paper, we introduce LenslessMic, a hybrid optical hardware-based encryption method that utilizes a lensless camera as a physical layer of security applicable to multiple types of audio. We show that LenslessMic enables (1) robust authentication of audio recordings and (2) encryption strength that can rival the search space of 256-bit digital standards, while maintaining high-quality signals and minimal loss of content information. The approach is validated with a low-cost Raspberry Pi prototype and is open-sourced together with datasets to facilitate research in the area.

Abstract: Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is the premier method for characterizing the nanoscale surface pores in ultrafiltration (UF) membranes and the support layers of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Based on SEM, the conventional understanding is that membranes typically have low surface porosities of <10%. We hypothesized that high acceleration voltage during SEM imaging and sputter metal coatings required for SEM have led to systematic underestimations of porosity and pore size. We showed that imaging a commercial UF membrane at 1, 5, and 10 kV reduced measured porosity from 10.3% (1 kV) to 6.3% (10 kV), while increasing Pt coating thickness from 1.5 to 5 nm lowered porosity by 54% for the UF membrane (12.9% to 5.8%) and 46% for an RO support (13.1% to 7.0%). To account for coating thickness, we developed a digital correction method that simulates pore dilation, enabling the pore structure to be estimated for uncoated membranes. Dilation yielded uncoated porosity values of 23% for the UF membrane and 20% for the RO support, about 3-fold greater than values observed with a 4 nm coating. Mean pore diameters were 2-fold greater for the UF membrane and 1.5-fold greater for the RO support. Critically, dilation-derived pore-size distributions agreed with low-flux dextran-retention data fitted with the Bungay-Brenner model. Our results suggest that surface porosities and pore sizes of nanoporous membranes are much larger than previously understood, with major implications for structure/transport relationships. For future nanoscale pore analysis of membranes (and other nanoporous materials), we recommend low acceleration voltage (1 kV), minimal coatings (1-2 nm), and digital dilation to account for coating artifacts

Abstract: How humans interpret and produce images is influenced by the images we have been exposed to. Similarly, visual generative AI models are exposed to many training images and learn to generate new images based on this. Given the importance of iconic images in human visual communication, as they are widely seen, reproduced, and used as inspiration, we may expect that they may similarly have a proportionally large influence within the generative AI process. In this work we explore this question through a three-part analysis, involving data attribution, semantic similarity analysis, and a user-study. Our findings indicate that iconic images do not have an obvious influence on the generative process, and that for many icons it is challenging to reproduce an image which resembles it closely. This highlights an important difference in how humans and visual generative AI models draw on and learn from prior visual communication.

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) based autoencoders often underutilize the global Class token and employ static attention mechanisms, limiting both generative control and optimization efficiency. This paper introduces ViTCAE, a framework that addresses these issues by re-purposing the Class token into a generative linchpin. In our architecture, the encoder maps the Class token to a global latent variable that dictates the prior distribution for local, patch-level latent variables, establishing a robust dependency where global semantics directly inform the synthesis of local details. Drawing inspiration from opinion dynamics, we treat each attention head as a dynamical system of interacting tokens seeking consensus. This perspective motivates a convergence-aware temperature scheduler that adaptively anneals each head's influence function based on its distributional stability. This process enables a principled head-freezing mechanism, guided by theoretically-grounded diagnostics like an attention evolution distance and a consensus/cluster functional. This technique prunes converged heads during training to significantly improve computational efficiency without sacrificing fidelity. By unifying a generative Class token with an adaptive attention mechanism rooted in multi-agent consensus theory, ViTCAE offers a more efficient and controllable approach to transformer-based generation.

Abstract: Bearing fault diagnosis in rotating machinery is critical for ensuring operational reliability, therefore early fault detection is essential to avoid catastrophic failures and expensive emergency repairs. Traditional methods like Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) often fail to capture the complex, non-stationary nature of vibration signals. This study leverages the cyclostationary properties of vibration data through Spectral Correlation Density (SCD) images to enhance fault detection and apply deep learning for classification. Using a publicly available dataset with bearing faults seeded in two distinct housings (A and B) under varying load conditions (0 Nm, 2 Nm, 4 Nm), we processed vibration signals into 2D SCD images to reveal fault-specific periodicities, such as broadband spectra (2000--8000 Hz) for larger faults. Three convolutional neural network (CNN) models, Custom CNN, ResNet152V2, and EfficientNetB0, were developed to classify seven bearing conditions. The custom CNN achieved the highest accuracies of 96.58\% and 94.95\% on Housing A and B, respectively, followed by ResNet152V2 at 96.49\% and 95.35\%, and EfficientNetB0 at 94.16\% and 91.65\%, respectively. The models' high accuracies across different housings demonstrate a robust solution suitable for cost-effective condition monitoring deployable near sensing platforms, contributing to applied machine learning for edge intelligence and showcasing effective signal processing strategies for handling complex, potentially large-scale vibration data.

Abstract: Machine learning is gaining significant attention as a diagnostic tool in medical imaging, particularly in the analysis of retinal fundus images. However, this approach is not yet clinically applicable, as it still depends on human validation from a professional. Therefore, we present the design for a mobile application that monitors metrics related to retinal fundus images correlating to age-related conditions. The purpose of this platform is to observe for a change in these metrics over time, offering early insights into potential ocular diseases without explicitly delivering diagnostics. Metrics analysed include vessel tortuosity, as well as signs of glaucoma, retinopathy and macular edema. To evaluate retinopathy grade and risk of macular edema, a model was trained on the Messidor dataset and compared to a similar model trained on the MAPLES-DR dataset. Information from the DeepSeeNet glaucoma detection model, as well as tortuosity calculations, is additionally incorporated to ultimately present a retinal fundus image monitoring platform. As a result, the mobile application permits monitoring of trends or changes in ocular metrics correlated to age-related conditions with regularly uploaded photographs.

<title>SOLAR: Switchable Output Layer for Accuracy and Robustness in Once-for-All Training</title>

Abstract: Once-for-All (OFA) training enables a single super-net to generate multiple sub-nets tailored to diverse deployment scenarios, supporting flexible trade-offs among accuracy, robustness, and model-size without retraining. However, as the number of supported sub-nets increases, excessive parameter sharing in the backbone limits representational capacity, leading to degraded calibration and reduced overall performance. To address this, we propose SOLAR (Switchable Output Layer for Accuracy and Robustness in Once-for-All Training), a simple yet effective technique that assigns each sub-net a separate classification head. By decoupling the logit learning process across sub-nets, the Switchable Output Layer (SOL) reduces representational interference and improves optimization, without altering the shared backbone. We evaluate SOLAR on five datasets (SVHN, CIFAR-10, STL-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet) using four super-net backbones (ResNet-34, WideResNet-16-8, WideResNet-40-2, and MobileNetV2) for two OFA training frameworks (OATS and SNNs). Experiments show that SOLAR outperforms the baseline methods: compared to OATS, it improves accuracy of sub-nets up to 1.26 %, 4.71 %, 1.67 %, and 1.76 %, and robustness up to 9.01 %, 7.71 %, 2.72 %, and 1.26 % on SVHN, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and CIFAR-100, respectively. Compared to SNNs, it improves TinyImageNet accuracy by up to 2.93 %, 2.34 %, and 1.35 % using ResNet-34, WideResNet-16-8, and MobileNetV2 backbones (with 8 sub-nets), respectively.

<title>PhysHDR: When Lighting Meets Materials and Scene Geometry in HDR Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Low Dynamic Range (LDR) to High Dynamic Range (HDR) image translation is a fundamental task in many computational vision problems. Numerous data-driven methods have been proposed to address this problem; however, they lack explicit modeling of illumination, lighting, and scene geometry in images. This limits the quality of the reconstructed HDR images. Since lighting and shadows interact differently with different materials, (e.g., specular surfaces such as glass and metal, and lambertian or diffuse surfaces such as wood and stone), modeling material-specific properties (e.g., specular and diffuse reflectance) has the potential to improve the quality of HDR image reconstruction. This paper presents PhysHDR, a simple yet powerful latent diffusion-based generative model for HDR image reconstruction. The denoising process is conditioned on lighting and depth information and guided by a novel loss to incorporate material properties of surfaces in the scene. The experimental results establish the efficacy of PhysHDR in comparison to a number of recent state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Towards Interpretable and Efficient Attention: Compressing All by Contracting a Few</title>

Abstract: Attention mechanisms in Transformers have gained significant empirical success. Nonetheless, the optimization objectives underlying their forward pass are still unclear. Additionally, the quadratic complexity of self-attention is increasingly prohibitive. Unlike the prior work on addressing the interpretability or efficiency issue separately, we propose a unified optimization objective to alleviate both issues simultaneously. By unrolling the optimization over the objective, we derive an inherently interpretable and efficient attention mechanism, which compresses all tokens into low-dimensional structures by contracting a few representative tokens and then broadcasting the contractions back. This Contract-and-Broadcast Self-Attention (CBSA) mechanism can not only scale linearly but also generalize existing attention mechanisms as its special cases. Experiments further demonstrate comparable performance and even superior advantages of CBSA on several visual tasks. Code is available at this https URL.

Abstract: Video and audio inpainting for mixed audio-visual content has become a crucial task in multimedia editing recently. However, precisely removing an object and its corresponding audio from a video without affecting the rest of the scene remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose VAInpaint, a novel pipeline that first utilizes a segmentation model to generate masks and guide a video inpainting model in removing objects. At the same time, an LLM then analyzes the scene globally, while a region-specific model provides localized descriptions. Both the overall and regional descriptions will be inputted into an LLM, which will refine the content and turn it into text queries for our text-driven audio separation model. Our audio separation model is fine-tuned on a customized dataset comprising segmented MUSIC instrument images and VGGSound backgrounds to enhance its generalization performance. Experiments show that our method achieves performance comparable to current benchmarks in both audio and video inpainting.

<title>Long-Tailed Out-of-Distribution Detection with Refined Separate Class Learning</title>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying robust machine learning models. However, when training data follows a long-tailed distribution, the model's ability to accurately detect OOD samples is significantly compromised, due to the confusion between OOD samples and head/tail classes. To distinguish OOD samples from both head and tail classes, the separate class learning (SCL) approach has emerged as a promising solution, which separately conduct head-specific and tail-specific class learning. To this end, we examine the limitations of existing works of SCL and reveal that the OOD detection performance is notably influenced by the use of static scaling temperature value and the presence of uninformative outliers. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel approach termed Refined Separate Class Learning (RSCL), which leverages dynamic class-wise temperature adjustment to modulate the temperature parameter for each in-distribution class and informative outlier mining to identify diverse types of outliers based on their affinity with head and tail classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCL achieves superior OOD detection performance while improving the classification accuracy on in-distribution data.

Abstract: Breast ultrasound (BUS) is an essential tool for diagnosing breast lesions, with millions of examinations per year. However, publicly available high-quality BUS benchmarks for AI development are limited in data scale and annotation richness. In this work, we present BUS-CoT, a BUS dataset for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning analysis, which contains 11,439 images of 10,019 lesions from 4,838 patients and covers all 99 histopathology types. To facilitate research on incentivizing CoT reasoning, we construct the reasoning processes based on observation, feature, diagnosis and pathology labels, annotated and verified by experienced experts. Moreover, by covering lesions of all histopathology types, we aim to facilitate robust AI systems in rare cases, which can be error-prone in clinical practice.

Abstract: Head and gaze dynamics are crucial in expressive 3D facial animation for conveying emotion and intention. However, existing methods frequently address facial components in isolation, overlooking the intricate coordination between gaze, head motion, and speech. The scarcity of high-quality gaze-annotated datasets hinders the development of data-driven models capable of capturing realistic, personalized gaze control. To address these challenges, we propose StyGazeTalk, an audio-driven method that generates synchronized gaze and head motion styles. We extract speaker-specific motion traits from gaze-head sequences with a multi-layer LSTM structure incorporating a style encoder, enabling the generation of diverse animation styles. We also introduce a high-precision multimodal dataset comprising eye-tracked gaze, audio, head pose, and 3D facial parameters, providing a valuable resource for training and evaluating head and gaze control models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates realistic, temporally coherent, and style-aware head-gaze motions, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in audio-driven facial animation.

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) are a natural implicit representation for open surfaces but, unlike Signed Distance Fields (SDFs), are challenging to triangulate into explicit meshes. This is especially true at high resolutions where neural UDFs exhibit higher noise levels, which makes it hard to capture fine details. Most current techniques perform within single voxels without reference to their neighborhood, resulting in missing surface and holes where the UDF is ambiguous or noisy. We show that this can be remedied by performing several passes and by reasoning on previously extracted surface elements to incorporate neighborhood information. Our key contribution is an iterative neural network that does this and progressively improves surface recovery within each voxel by spatially propagating information from increasingly distant neighbors. Unlike single-pass methods, our approach integrates newly detected surfaces, distance values, and gradients across multiple iterations, effectively correcting errors and stabilizing extraction in challenging regions. Experiments on diverse 3D models demonstrate that our method produces significantly more accurate and complete meshes than existing approaches, particularly for complex geometries, enabling UDF surface extraction at higher resolutions where traditional methods fail.

Abstract: One way illustrators engage in disciplined drawing - the process of drawing to improve technical skills - is through studying and replicating reference images. However, for many novice and intermediate digital artists, knowing how to approach studying a reference image can be challenging. It can also be difficult to receive immediate feedback on their works-in-progress. To help these users develop their professional vision, we propose ArtKrit, a tool that scaffolds the process of replicating a reference image into three main steps: composition, value, and color. At each step, our tool offers computational guidance, such as adaptive composition line generation, and automatic feedback, such as value and color accuracy. Evaluating this tool with intermediate digital artists revealed that ArtKrit could flexibly accommodate their unique workflows. Our code and supplemental materials are available at https://majiaju.io/artkrit .

Abstract: Visual teach-and-repeat navigation enables robots to autonomously traverse previously demonstrated paths by comparing current sensory input with recorded trajectories. However, conventional frame-based cameras fundamentally limit system responsiveness: their fixed frame rates (typically 30-60 Hz) create inherent latency between environmental changes and control responses. Here we present the first event-camera-based visual teach-and-repeat system. To achieve this, we develop a frequency-domain cross-correlation framework that transforms the event stream matching problem into computationally efficient Fourier space multiplications, capable of exceeding 300Hz processing rates, an order of magnitude faster than frame-based approaches. By exploiting the binary nature of event frames and applying image compression techniques, we further enhance the computational speed of the cross-correlation process without sacrificing localization accuracy. Extensive experiments using a Prophesee EVK4 HD event camera mounted on an AgileX Scout Mini robot demonstrate successful autonomous navigation across 4000+ meters of indoor and outdoor trajectories. Our system achieves ATEs below 24 cm while maintaining consistent high-frequency control updates. Our evaluations show that our approach achieves substantially higher update rates compared to conventional frame-based systems, underscoring the practical viability of event-based perception for real-time robotic navigation.

Abstract: Coral aquaculture for reef restoration requires accurate and continuous spawn counting for resource distribution and larval health monitoring, but current methods are labor-intensive and represent a critical bottleneck in the coral production pipeline. We propose the Coral Spawn and Larvae Imaging Camera System (CSLICS), which uses low cost modular cameras and object detectors trained using human-in-the-loop labeling approaches for automated spawn counting in larval rearing tanks. This paper details the system engineering, dataset collection, and computer vision techniques to detect, classify and count coral spawn. Experimental results from mass spawning events demonstrate an F1 score of 82.4\% for surface spawn detection at different embryogenesis stages, 65.3\% F1 score for sub-surface spawn detection, and a saving of 5,720 hours of labor per spawning event compared to manual sampling methods at the same frequency. Comparison of manual counts with CSLICS monitoring during a mass coral spawning event on the Great Barrier Reef demonstrates CSLICS' accurate measurement of fertilization success and sub-surface spawn counts. These findings enhance the coral aquaculture process and enable upscaling of coral reef restoration efforts to address climate change threats facing ecosystems like the Great Barrier Reef.

Abstract: Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are the primary medium for human-computer interaction, yet automating GUI interactions remains challenging due to the complexity of visual elements, dynamic environments, and the need for multi-step reasoning. Existing methods based on vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from limited resolution, domain mismatch, and insufficient sequential decisionmaking capability. To address these issues, we propose Mano, a robust GUI agent built upon a multi-modal foundation model pre-trained on extensive web and computer system data. Our approach integrates a novel simulated environment for high-fidelity data generation, a three-stage training pipeline (supervised fine-tuning, offline reinforcement learning, and online reinforcement learning), and a verification module for error recovery. Mano demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple GUI benchmarks, including Mind2Web and OSWorld, achieving significant improvements in success rate and operational accuracy. Our work provides new insights into the effective integration of reinforcement learning with VLMs for practical GUI agent deployment, highlighting the importance of domain-specific data, iterative training, and holistic reward design.

Abstract: Spelling correction from visual input poses unique challenges for vision language models (VLMs), as it requires not only detecting but also correcting textual errors directly within images. We present ReViCo (Real Visual Correction), the first benchmark that systematically evaluates VLMs on real-world visual spelling correction across Chinese and English. ReViCo contains naturally occurring errors collected from real-world image data and supports fine-grained evaluation at both image and token levels. Through comprehensive experiments on representative cascaded (Qwen) and native (InternVL) open-source models, as well as closed-source systems (GPT-4o, Claude), we show that current VLMs fall significantly short of human performance, particularly in correction. To address these limitations, we explore two solution paradigms: a Joint OCR-Correction pipeline and a Background Information enhanced approach, both of which yield consistent performance gains. Our analysis highlights fundamental limitations of existing architectures and provides actionable insights for advancing multimodal spelling correction.

Abstract: As generative models are advancing in quality and quantity for creating synthetic content, deepfakes begin to cause online mistrust. Deepfake detectors are proposed to counter this effect, however, misuse of detectors claiming fake content as real or vice versa further fuels this misinformation problem. We present the first comprehensive uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors, systematically investigating how generative artifacts influence prediction confidence. As reflected in detectors' responses, deepfake generators also contribute to this uncertainty as their generative residues vary, so we cross the uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors and generators. Based on our observations, the uncertainty manifold holds enough consistent information to leverage uncertainty for deepfake source detection. Our approach leverages Bayesian Neural Networks and Monte Carlo dropout to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties across diverse detector architectures. We evaluate uncertainty on two datasets with nine generators, with four blind and two biological detectors, compare different uncertainty methods, explore region- and pixel-based uncertainty, and conduct ablation studies. We conduct and analyze binary real/fake, multi-class real/fake, source detection, and leave-one-out experiments between the generator/detector combinations to share their generalization capability, model calibration, uncertainty, and robustness against adversarial attacks. We further introduce uncertainty maps that localize prediction confidence at the pixel level, revealing distinct patterns correlated with generator-specific artifacts. Our analysis provides critical insights for deploying reliable deepfake detection systems and establishes uncertainty quantification as a fundamental requirement for trustworthy synthetic media detection.

Abstract: LoRA has become one of the most widely used parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, numerous studies have shown that LoRA often introduces substantial parameter redundancy, which not only increases the number of trainable parameters but also hinders the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Since identifying redundant parameters in LoRA is inherently difficult, how to eliminate them efficiently and accurately remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose TASO, a redundancy reduction method that leverages importance information from the pretrained model's weights to mitigate LoRA redundancy. Specifically, we estimate parameter importance on downstream tasks and identify task-specific core regions based on the distribution of importance scores. The location information of these core regions is then used to determine the sparse structure of LoRA modules, enabling redundancy removal before fine-tuning. Our approach significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters required for task adaptation, while providing a novel task-aligned perspective for LoRA redundancy reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that, with a parameter budget comparable to LoRA with rank $r = 1$, TASO consistently outperforms standard LoRA across multiple tasks, achieving strong fine-tuning performance while effectively eliminating redundant parameters.

Abstract: Neural fields offer continuous, learnable representations that extend beyond traditional discrete formats in visual computing. We study the problem of learning neural representations of repeated antiderivatives directly from a function, a continuous analogue of summed-area tables. Although widely used in discrete domains, such cumulative schemes rely on grids, which prevents their applicability in continuous neural contexts. We introduce and analyze a range of neural methods for repeated integration, including both adaptations of prior work and novel designs. Our evaluation spans multiple input dimensionalities and integration orders, assessing both reconstruction quality and performance in downstream tasks such as filtering and rendering. These results enable integrating classical cumulative operators into modern neural systems and offer insights into learning tasks involving differential and integral operators.

Abstract: We present Qwen3-Omni, a single multimodal model that, for the first time, maintains state-of-the-art performance across text, image, audio, and video without any degradation relative to single-modal counterparts. Qwen3-Omni matches the performance of same-sized single-modal models within the Qwen series and excels particularly on audio tasks. Across 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni achieves open-source SOTA on 32 benchmarks and overall SOTA on 22, outperforming strong closed-source models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro, Seed-ASR, and GPT-4o-Transcribe. Qwen3-Omni adopts a Thinker-Talker MoE architecture that unifies perception and generation across text, images, audio, and video, yielding fluent text and natural real-time speech. It supports text interaction in 119 languages, speech understanding in 19 languages, and speech generation in 10 languages. To reduce first-packet latency in streaming synthesis, Talker autoregressively predicts discrete speech codecs using a multi-codebook scheme. Leveraging the representational capacity of these codebooks, we replace computationally intensive block-wise diffusion with a lightweight causal ConvNet, enabling streaming from the first codec frame. In cold-start settings, Qwen3-Omni achieves a theoretical end-to-end first-packet latency of 234 ms. To further strengthen multimodal reasoning, we introduce a Thinking model that explicitly reasons over inputs from any modality. Since the research community currently lacks a general-purpose audio captioning model, we fine-tuned Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B to obtain Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B-Captioner, which produces detailed, low-hallucination captions for arbitrary audio inputs.

<title>Sight Over Site: Perception-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Robotic Inspection</title>

Abstract: Autonomous inspection is a central problem in robotics, with applications ranging from industrial monitoring to search-and-rescue. Traditionally, inspection has often been reduced to navigation tasks, where the objective is to reach a predefined location while avoiding obstacles. However, this formulation captures only part of the real inspection problem. In real-world environments, the inspection targets may become visible well before their exact coordinates are reached, making further movement both redundant and inefficient. What matters more for inspection is not simply arriving at the target's position, but positioning the robot at a viewpoint from which the target becomes observable. In this work, we revisit inspection from a perception-aware perspective. We propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that explicitly incorporates target visibility as the primary objective, enabling the robot to find the shortest trajectory that guarantees visual contact with the target without relying on a map. The learned policy leverages both perceptual and proprioceptive sensing and is trained entirely in simulation, before being deployed to a real-world robot. We further develop an algorithm to compute ground-truth shortest inspection paths, which provides a reference for evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our method outperforms existing classical and learning-based navigation approaches, yielding more efficient inspection trajectories in both simulated and real-world settings.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has substantially progressed by directly predicting future trajectories from raw perception inputs, which bypasses traditional modular pipelines. However, mainstream methods trained via imitation learning suffer from critical safety limitations, as they fail to distinguish between trajectories that appear human-like but are potentially unsafe. Some recent approaches attempt to address this by regressing multiple rule-driven scores but decoupling supervision from policy optimization, resulting in suboptimal performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose DriveDPO, a Safety Direct Preference Optimization Policy Learning framework. First, we distill a unified policy distribution from human imitation similarity and rule-based safety scores for direct policy optimization. Further, we introduce an iterative Direct Preference Optimization stage formulated as trajectory-level preference alignment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that DriveDPO achieves a new state-of-the-art PDMS of 90.0. Furthermore, qualitative results across diverse challenging scenarios highlight DriveDPO's ability to produce safer and more reliable driving behaviors.

<title>ComposableNav: Instruction-Following Navigation in Dynamic Environments via Composable Diffusion</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17941</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.17941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of enabling robots to navigate dynamic environments while following instructions. The challenge lies in the combinatorial nature of instruction specifications: each instruction can include multiple specifications, and the number of possible specification combinations grows exponentially as the robot's skill set expands. For example, "overtake the pedestrian while staying on the right side of the road" consists of two specifications: "overtake the pedestrian" and "walk on the right side of the road." To tackle this challenge, we propose ComposableNav, based on the intuition that following an instruction involves independently satisfying its constituent specifications, each corresponding to a distinct motion primitive. Using diffusion models, ComposableNav learns each primitive separately, then composes them in parallel at deployment time to satisfy novel combinations of specifications unseen in training. Additionally, to avoid the onerous need for demonstrations of individual motion primitives, we propose a two-stage training procedure: (1) supervised pre-training to learn a base diffusion model for dynamic navigation, and (2) reinforcement learning fine-tuning that molds the base model into different motion primitives. Through simulation and real-world experiments, we show that ComposableNav enables robots to follow instructions by generating trajectories that satisfy diverse and unseen combinations of specifications, significantly outperforming both non-compositional VLM-based policies and costmap composing baselines.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in diverse applications, but the problems of high latency and energy overhead are inevitable on resource-constrained devices. To address this challenge, most researchers focus on the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique to balance the latency and energy consumption by changing the computing frequency of processors. However, the adjustment of memory frequency is usually ignored and not fully utilized to achieve efficient DNN inference, which also plays a significant role in the inference time and energy consumption. In this paper, we first investigate the impact of joint memory frequency and computing frequency scaling on the inference time and energy consumption with a model-based and data-driven method. Then by combining with the fitting parameters of different DNN models, we give a preliminary analysis for the proposed model to see the effects of adjusting memory frequency and computing frequency simultaneously. Finally, simulation results in local inference and cooperative inference cases further validate the effectiveness of jointly scaling the memory frequency and computing frequency to reduce the energy consumption of devices.

<title>Intra-Cluster Mixup: An Effective Data Augmentation Technique for Complementary-Label Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17971</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.17971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges of complementary-label learning (CLL), a specialized form of weakly-supervised learning (WSL) where models are trained with labels indicating classes to which instances do not belong, rather than standard ordinary labels. This alternative supervision is appealing because collecting complementary labels is generally cheaper and less labor-intensive. Although most existing research in CLL emphasizes the development of novel loss functions, the potential of data augmentation in this domain remains largely underexplored. In this work, we uncover that the widely-used Mixup data augmentation technique is ineffective when directly applied to CLL. Through in-depth analysis, we identify that the complementary-label noise generated by Mixup negatively impacts the performance of CLL models. We then propose an improved technique called Intra-Cluster Mixup (ICM), which only synthesizes augmented data from nearby examples, to mitigate the noise effect. ICM carries the benefits of encouraging complementary label sharing of nearby examples, and leads to substantial performance improvements across synthetic and real-world labeled datasets. In particular, our wide spectrum of experimental results on both balanced and imbalanced CLL settings justifies the potential of ICM in allying with state-of-the-art CLL algorithms, achieving significant accuracy increases of 30% and 10% on MNIST and CIFAR datasets, respectively.

<title>Detection of Misreporting Attacks on Software-Defined Immersive Environments</title>

Abstract: The ability to centrally control network infrastructure using a programmable middleware has made Software-Defined Networking (SDN) ideal for emerging applications, such as immersive environments. However, such flexibility introduces new vulnerabilities, such as switch misreporting led load imbalance, which in turn make such immersive environment vulnerable to severe quality degradation. In this paper, we present a hybrid machine learning (ML)-based network anomaly detection framework that identifies such stealthy misreporting by capturing temporal inconsistencies in switch-reported loads, and thereby counter potentially catastrophic quality degradation of hosted immersive application. The detection system combines unsupervised anomaly scoring with supervised classification to robustly distinguish malicious behavior. Data collected from a realistic testbed deployment under both benign and adversarial conditions is used to train and evaluate the model. Experimental results show that the framework achieves high recall in detecting misreporting behavior, making it effective for early and reliable detection in SDN environments.

<title>MetaEmbed: Scaling Multimodal Retrieval at Test-Time with Flexible Late Interaction</title>

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models have achieved great success in capturing semantic relevance between queries and candidates. However, current methods either condense queries and candidates into a single vector, potentially limiting the expressiveness for fine-grained information, or produce too many vectors that are prohibitively expensive for multi-vector retrieval. In this work, we introduce MetaEmbed, a new framework for multimodal retrieval that rethinks how multimodal embeddings are constructed and interacted with at scale. During training, a fixed number of learnable Meta Tokens are appended to the input sequence. At test-time, their last-layer contextualized representations serve as compact yet expressive multi-vector embeddings. Through the proposed Matryoshka Multi-Vector Retrieval training, MetaEmbed learns to organize information by granularity across multiple vectors. As a result, we enable test-time scaling in multimodal retrieval, where users can balance retrieval quality against efficiency demands by selecting the number of tokens used for indexing and retrieval interactions. Extensive evaluations on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB) and the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark (ViDoRe) confirm that MetaEmbed achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance while scaling robustly to models with 32B parameters.

Abstract: In the past few years the transformer model has been utilized for a variety of tasks such as image captioning, image classification natural language generation, and natural language understanding. As a key component of the transformer model, self-attention calculates the attention values by mapping the relationships among the head elements of the source and target sequence, yet there is no explicit mechanism to refine and intensify the attention values with respect to the context of the input and target sequences. Based on this intuition, we introduce a novel refine and intensify attention mechanism that is called Zoneup Dropout Injection Attention Calculation (ZoDIAC), in which the intensities of attention values in the elements of the input source and target sequences are first refined using GELU and dropout and then intensified using a proposed zoneup process which includes the injection of a learned scalar factor. Our extensive experiments show that ZoDIAC achieves statistically significant higher scores under all image captioning metrics using various feature extractors in comparison to the conventional self-attention module in the transformer model on the MS-COCO dataset. Our proposed ZoDIAC attention modules can be used as a drop-in replacement for the attention components in all transformer models. The code for our experiments is publicly available at: https://github.com/zanyarz/zodiac

Abstract: Selection of appropriate template matching algorithms to run effectively on real-time low-cost systems is always major issue. This is due to unpredictable changes in image scene which often necessitate more sophisticated real-time algorithms to retain image consistency. Inefficiency of low cost auxiliary hardware and time limitations are the major constraints in using these sorts of algorithms. The real-time system introduced here copes with these problems utilising a fast running template matching algorithm, which makes use of best colour band selection. The system uses fast running real-time algorithms to achieve template matching and vehicle classification at about 4 frames /sec. on low-cost hardware. The colour image sequences have been taken by a fixed CCTV camera overlooking a busy multi-lane road

Abstract: An important line of research attempts to explain CNN image classifier predictions and intermediate layer representations in terms of human-understandable concepts. Previous work supports that deep representations are linearly separable with respect to their concept label, implying that the feature space has directions where intermediate representations may be projected onto, to become more understandable. These directions are called interpretable, and when considered as a set, they may form an interpretable feature space basis. Compared to previous top-down probing approaches which use concept annotations to identify the interpretable directions one at a time, in this work, we take a bottom-up approach, identifying the directions from the structure of the feature space, collectively, without relying on supervision from concept labels. Instead, we learn the directions by optimizing for a sparsity property that holds for any interpretable basis. We experiment with existing popular CNNs and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in extracting an interpretable basis across network architectures and training datasets. We make extensions to existing basis interpretability metrics and show that intermediate layer representations become more interpretable when transformed with the extracted bases. Finally, we compare the bases extracted with our method with the bases derived with supervision and find that, in one aspect, unsupervised basis extraction has a strength that constitutes a limitation of learning the basis with supervision, and we provide potential directions for future research.

Abstract: This paper proposes Semantic Inference (SINF) that creates semantic subgraphs in a Deep Neural Network(DNN) based on a new Discriminative Capability Score (DCS) to drastically reduce the DNN computational load with limited performance loss.~We evaluate the performance SINF on VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 DNNs trained on CIFAR100 and a subset of the ImageNet dataset. Moreover, we compare its performance against 6 state-of-the-art pruning approaches. Our results show that (i) on average, SINF reduces the inference time of VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 respectively by up to 29%, 35%, and 15% with only 3.75%, 0.17%, and 6.75% accuracy loss for CIFAR100 while for ImageNet benchmark, the reduction in inference time is 18%, 22%, and 9% for accuracy drop of 3%, 2.5%, and 6%; (ii) DCS achieves respectively up to 3.65%, 4.25%, and 2.36% better accuracy with VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50 with respect to existing discriminative scores for CIFAR100 and the same for ImageNet is 8.9%, 5.8%, and 5.2% respectively. Through experimental evaluation on Raspberry Pi and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, we show SINF is about 51% and 38% more energy efficient and takes about 25% and 17% less inference time than the base model for CIFAR100 and ImageNet.

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSI) clustering is an important but challenging task. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods usually rely on superpixels, however, they do not fully utilize the spatial and spectral information in HSI 3-D structure, and their optimization targets are not clustering-oriented. In this work, we first use 3-D and 2-D hybrid convolutional neural networks to extract the high-order spatial and spectral features of HSI through pre-training, and then design a superpixel graph contrastive clustering (SPGCC) model to learn discriminative superpixel representations. Reasonable augmented views are crucial for contrastive clustering, and conventional contrastive learning may hurt the cluster structure since different samples are pushed away in the embedding space even if they belong to the same class. In SPGCC, we design two semantic-invariant data augmentations for HSI superpixels: pixel sampling augmentation and model weight augmentation. Then sample-level alignment and clustering-center-level contrast are performed for better intra-class similarity and inter-class dissimilarity of superpixel embeddings. We perform clustering and network optimization alternatively. Experimental results on several HSI datasets verify the advantages of the proposed SPGCC compared to SOTA methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/jhqi/spgcc.

Abstract: While multimodal contrastive learning methods (e.g., CLIP) can achieve impressive zero-shot classification performance, recent research has revealed that these methods are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. To defend against backdoor attacks on CLIP, existing defense methods focus on either the pre-training stage or the fine-tuning stage, which would unfortunately cause high computational costs due to numerous parameter updates and are not applicable in black-box settings. In this paper, we provide the first attempt at a computationally efficient backdoor detection method to defend against backdoored CLIP in the \emph{inference} stage. We empirically find that the visual representations of backdoored images are \emph{insensitive} to \emph{benign} and \emph{malignant} changes in class description texts. Motivated by this observation, we propose BDetCLIP, a novel test-time backdoor detection method based on contrastive prompting. Specifically, we first prompt a language model (e.g., GPT-4) to produce class-related description texts (benign) and class-perturbed random texts (malignant) by specially designed instructions. Then, the distribution difference in cosine similarity between images and the two types of class description texts can be used as the criterion to detect backdoor samples. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed BDetCLIP is superior to state-of-the-art backdoor detection methods, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Our codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/Purshow/BDetCLIP.

Abstract: Understanding long-form videos, such as movies and TV episodes ranging from tens of minutes to two hours, remains a significant challenge for multi-modal models. Existing benchmarks often fail to test the full range of cognitive skills needed to process these temporally rich and narratively complex inputs. Therefore, we introduce InfiniBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of models in long video understanding rigorously. InfiniBench offers:(1) Over 1,000 hours of video content, with an average video length of 53 minutes. (2) The largest set of question-answer pairs for long video comprehension, totaling around 87.7 K. (3) Eight diverse skills that span both grounding-based (e.g., scene transitions, character actions) and reasoning-based (e.g., deep context understanding, multi-event linking). (4) Rich annotation formats, including both multiple-choice and open-ended questions. We conducted an in-depth evaluation across both commercial (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) and most recent open-source vision-language models such as Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3.0). Results reveal that:(1) Models struggle across the board: Even the best model, GPT-4o, achieves only 47.1 % on grounding-based skills, with most models performing near or just above random chance. (2) Strong reliance on world knowledge: Models achieve surprisingly high scores using only metadata (e.g., video titles), highlighting a tendency to rely on pre-trained knowledge rather than actual visual or temporal understanding. (3) Multi-Modal Importance: When provided with full video and subtitle context, however, models show substantial improvements, confirming the critical role of multimodal input in video understanding.

Abstract: Recently, numerous methods have achieved impressive performance in remote sensing object detection, relying on convolution or transformer architectures. Such detectors typically have a feature backbone to extract useful features from raw input images. A common practice in current detectors is initializing the backbone with pre-trained weights available online. Fine-tuning the backbone is typically required to generate features suitable for remote-sensing images. While the prolonged training could lead to over-fitting, hindering the extraction of basic visual features, it can enable models to gradually extract deeper insights and richer representations from remote sensing data. Striking a balance between these competing factors is critical for achieving optimal performance. In this study, we aim to investigate the performance and characteristics of remote sensing object detection models under very long training schedules, and propose a novel method named Dynamic Backbone Freezing (DBF) for feature backbone fine-tuning on remote sensing object detection under long-term training. Our method addresses the dilemma of whether the backbone should extract low-level generic features or possess specific knowledge of the remote sensing domain, by introducing a module called 'Freezing Scheduler' to manage the update of backbone features during long-term training dynamically. Extensive experiments on DOTA and DIOR-R show that our approach enables more accurate model learning while substantially reducing computational costs in long-term training. Besides, it can be seamlessly adopted without additional effort due to its straightforward design. The code is available at https://github.com/unique-chan/dbf.

Abstract: In the domain of multi-baseline stereo, the conventional understanding is that, in general, increasing baseline separation substantially enhances the accuracy of depth estimation. However, prevailing self-supervised depth estimation architectures primarily use minimal frame separation and a constrained stereo baseline. Larger frame separations can be employed; however, we show this to result in diminished depth quality due to various factors, including significant changes in brightness, and increased areas of occlusion. In response to these challenges, our proposed method, BaseBoostDepth, incorporates a curriculum learning-inspired optimization strategy to effectively leverage larger frame separations. However, we show that our curriculum learning-inspired strategy alone does not suffice, as larger baselines still cause pose estimation drifts. Therefore, we introduce incremental pose estimation to enhance the accuracy of pose estimations, resulting in significant improvements across all depth metrics. Additionally, to improve the robustness of the model, we introduce error-induced reconstructions, which optimize reconstructions with added error to the pose estimations. Ultimately, our final depth network achieves state-of-the-art performance on KITTI and SYNS-patches datasets across image-based, edge-based, and point cloud-based metrics without increasing computational complexity at test time.

Abstract: Subtle semantic differences in retinal image and text data present great challenges for pre-training visual-language models. Moreover, false negative samples, i.e., image-text pairs having the same semantics but incorrectly regarded as negatives, disrupt the visual-language pre-training process and affect the model's learning ability. This work aims to develop a retinal foundation model, called ViLReF, by pre-training on a paired dataset comprising 451,956 retinal images and corresponding diagnostic text reports. In our vision-language pre-training strategy, we leverage expert knowledge to facilitate the extraction of labels and propose a novel constraint, the Weighted Similarity Coupling Loss, to adjust the speed of pushing sample pairs further apart dynamically within the feature space. Furthermore, we employ a batch expansion module with dynamic memory queues, maintained by momentum encoders, to supply extra samples and compensate for the vacancies caused by eliminating false negatives. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple datasets for downstream classification and segmentation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the powerful zero-shot and transfer learning capabilities of ViLReF, verifying the effectiveness of our pre-training strategy. Our ViLReF model is available at: https://github.com/T6Yang/ViLReF.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) remains an unresolved challenge in computer vision due to complex distortions, diverse image content, and limited data availability. Existing Blind IQA (BIQA) methods largely rely on extensive human annotations, which are labor-intensive and costly due to the demanding nature of creating IQA datasets. To reduce this dependency, we propose the Gradient-Regulated Meta-Prompt IQA Framework (GRMP-IQA), designed to efficiently adapt the visual-language pre-trained model, CLIP, to IQA tasks, achieving high accuracy even with limited data. GRMP-IQA consists of two core modules: (i) Meta-Prompt Pre-training Module and (ii) Quality-Aware Gradient Regularization. The Meta Prompt Pre-training Module leverages a meta-learning paradigm to pre-train soft prompts with shared meta-knowledge across different distortions, enabling rapid adaptation to various IQA tasks. On the other hand, the Quality-Aware Gradient Regularization is designed to adjust the update gradients during fine-tuning, focusing the model's attention on quality-relevant features and preventing overfitting to semantic information. Extensive experiments on standard BIQA datasets demonstrate the superior performance to the state-of-the-art BIQA methods under limited data setting. Notably, utilizing just 20% of the training data, GRMP-IQA is competitive with most existing fully supervised BIQA approaches.

Abstract: Event cameras are bio-inspired sensors that capture intensity changes asynchronously with distinct advantages, such as high temporal resolution. Existing methods for event-based object/action recognition predominantly sample and convert event representation at every fixed temporal interval (or frequency). However, they are constrained to processing a limited number of event lengths and show poor frequency generalization, thus not fully leveraging the event's high temporal resolution. In this paper, we present our PASS framework, exhibiting superior capacity for spatiotemporal event modeling towards a larger number of event lengths and generalization across varying inference temporal frequencies. Our key insight is to learn adaptively encoded event features via the state space models (SSMs), whose linear complexity and generalization on input frequency make them ideal for processing high temporal resolution events. Specifically, we propose a Path-selective Event Aggregation and Scan (PEAS) module to encode events into features with fixed dimensions by adaptively scanning and selecting aggregated event presentations. On top of it, we introduce a novel Multi-faceted Selection Guiding (MSG) loss to minimize the randomness and redundancy of the encoded features during the PEAS selection process. Our method outperforms prior methods on five public datasets and shows strong generalization across varying inference frequencies with less accuracy drop (ours -8.62% vs. -20.69% for the baseline). Overall, PASS exhibits strong long spatiotemporal modeling for a broader distribution of event length (1-10^9), precise temporal perception, and generalization for real-world

Abstract: Recent works in volume rendering, \textit{e.g.} NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), significantly advance the rendering quality and efficiency with the help of the learned implicit neural radiance field or 3D Gaussians. Rendering on top of an explicit representation, the vanilla 3DGS and its variants deliver real-time efficiency by optimizing the parametric model with single-view supervision per iteration during training which is adopted from NeRF. Consequently, certain views are overfitted, leading to unsatisfying appearance in novel-view synthesis and imprecise 3D geometries. To solve aforementioned problems, we propose a new 3DGS optimization method embodying four key novel contributions: 1) We transform the conventional single-view training paradigm into a multi-view training strategy. With our proposed multi-view regulation, 3D Gaussian attributes are further optimized without overfitting certain training views. As a general solution, we improve the overall accuracy in a variety of scenarios and different Gaussian variants. 2) Inspired by the benefit introduced by additional views, we further propose a cross-intrinsic guidance scheme, leading to a coarse-to-fine training procedure concerning different resolutions. 3) Built on top of our multi-view regulated training, we further propose a cross-ray densification strategy, densifying more Gaussian kernels in the ray-intersect regions from a selection of views. 4) By further investigating the densification strategy, we found that the effect of densification should be enhanced when certain views are distinct dramatically. As a solution, we propose a novel multi-view augmented densification strategy, where 3D Gaussians are encouraged to get densified to a sufficient number accordingly, resulting in improved reconstruction accuracy.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have witnessed significant progress on visual understanding tasks. However, they often prioritize language knowledge over image information on visual reasoning tasks, incurring performance degradation. To tackle this issue, we first identify the drawbacks of existing solutions (i.e., limited multi-modal reasoning capacities, and insufficient and irrelevant visual descriptions). We then decompose visual reasoning process into two stages: proactive visual perception (i.e., eyesight) and textual reasoning (i.e., wisdom), and introduce a novel visual reasoning framework named ProReason. This framework features decoupled vision-reasoning capabilities and multi-run proactive perception. Briefly, given a multi-modal question, ProReason iterates proactive information collection and reasoning until the answer can be concluded with necessary and sufficient visual descriptions. Notably, the disassociation of capabilities allows seamless integration of existing large language models (LLMs) to compensate for the reasoning deficits of LVLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ProReason outperforms existing multi-step reasoning frameworks on various benchmarks for both open-source and closed-source models, with the average performance gain reaching 13.2%. Besides, the integration of LLMs allows ProReason to produce high-quality visual reasoning data, which empowers ProReason-distilled models (i.e., ProReason-VL and ProReason-Q3) to achieve superior performance in downstream tasks. Our insights into existing solutions and the decoupled perspective for feasible integration of LLMs illuminate future research on visual reasoning techniques, especially LLM-assisted ones.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced performance across benchmarks. However, data contamination-unintentional memorization of benchmark data during model training-poses critical challenges for fair evaluation. Existing detection methods for unimodal large language models (LLMs) are inadequate for MLLMs due to multimodal data complexity and multi-phase training. We systematically analyze multimodal data contamination using our analytical framework, MM-Detect, which defines two contamination categories-unimodal and cross-modal-and effectively quantifies contamination severity across multiple-choice and caption-based Visual Question Answering tasks. Evaluations on twelve MLLMs and five benchmarks reveal significant contamination, particularly in proprietary models and older benchmarks. Crucially, contamination sometimes originates during unimodal pre-training rather than solely from multimodal fine-tuning. Our insights refine contamination understanding, guiding evaluation practices and improving multimodal model reliability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in static feed-forward scene reconstruction have demonstrated significant progress in high-quality novel view synthesis. However, these models often struggle with generalizability across diverse environments and fail to effectively handle dynamic content. We present BTimer (short for BulletTimer), the first motion-aware feed-forward model for real-time reconstruction and novel view synthesis of dynamic scenes. Our approach reconstructs the full scene in a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation at a given target ('bullet') timestamp by aggregating information from all the context frames. Such a formulation allows BTimer to gain scalability and generalization by leveraging both static and dynamic scene datasets. Given a casual monocular dynamic video, BTimer reconstructs a bullet-time scene within 150ms while reaching state-of-the-art performance on both static and dynamic scene datasets, even compared with optimization-based approaches.

<title>KNN-MMD: Cross Domain Wireless Sensing via Local Distribution Alignment</title>

Abstract: Wireless sensing has recently found widespread applications in diverse environments, including homes, offices, and public spaces. By analyzing patterns in channel state information (CSI), it is possible to infer human actions for tasks such as person identification, gesture recognition, and fall detection. However, CSI is highly sensitive to environmental changes, where even minor alterations can significantly distort the CSI patterns. This sensitivity often leads to performance degradation or outright failure when applying wireless sensing models trained in one environment to another. To address this challenge, Domain Alignment (DAL) has been widely adopted for cross-domain classification tasks, as it focuses on aligning the global distributions of the source and target domains in feature space. Despite its popularity, DAL often neglects inter-category relationships, which can lead to misalignment between categories across domains, even when global alignment is achieved. To overcome these limitations, we propose K-Nearest Neighbors Maximum Mean Discrepancy (KNN-MMD), a novel few-shot method for cross-domain wireless sensing. Our approach begins by constructing a help set using KNN from the target domain, enabling local alignment between the source and target domains within each category using MMD. Additionally, we address a key instability issue commonly observed in cross-domain methods, where model performance fluctuates sharply between epochs. Further, most existing methods struggle to determine an optimal stopping point during training due to the absence of labeled data from the target domain. Our method resolves this by excluding the support set from the target domain during training and employing it as a validation set to determine the stopping criterion.The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/KNN-MMD .

Abstract: In recent times, the standard practice for developing MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. This approach often causes models to lean towards language comprehension and undermine the rich visual perception signals present in the data, which are critical for tasks involving spatial reasoning in the domain of embodied AI and robotics. Is it possible to optimize both at the same time? In this work, we propose VisPer-LM, the first approach that infuses visual perception knowledge from expert vision encoders into the LLM's (of an MLLM) hidden representations. We start by investigating MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Given this insight, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next (text) token prediction. Moreover, through extensive probing, we observe improved visual representation quality due to embedding optimization, underscoring the effectiveness of our probing setup. We demonstrate that our VisPer-LM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. In particular, VisPer-LM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.

Abstract: 3D cell segmentation methods are often hindered by \emph{oversegmentation}, where a single cell is incorrectly split into multiple fragments. This degrades the final segmentation quality and is notoriously difficult to resolve, as oversegmentation errors often resemble natural gaps between adjacent cells. Our work makes two key contributions. First, for 3D cell segmentation, we are the first work to formulate oversegmentation as a concrete problem and propose a geometric framework to identify and correct these errors. Our approach builds a pre-trained classifier using both 2D geometric and 3D topological features extracted from flawed 3D segmentation results. Second, we introduce a novel metric, Geo-Wasserstein divergence, to quantify changes in 2D geometries. This captures the evolving trends of cell mask shape in a geometry-aware manner. We validate our method through extensive experiments on in-domain plant datasets, including both synthesized and real oversegmented cases, as well as on out-of-domain animal datasets to demonstrate transfer learning performance. An ablation study further highlights the contribution of the Geo-Wasserstein divergence. A clear pipeline is provided for end-users to build pre-trained models to any labeled dataset.

Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation is crucial for creating lifelike avatars and enhancing human-computer interactions by synchronizing gestures with speech. Despite recent advancements, existing methods struggle with accurately identifying the rhythmic or semantic triggers from audio for generating contextualized gesture patterns and achieving pixel-level realism. To address these challenges, we introduce Contextual Gesture, a framework that improves co-speech gesture video generation through three innovative components: (1) a chronological speech-gesture alignment that temporally connects two modalities, (2) a contextualized gesture tokenization that incorporate speech context into motion pattern representation through distillation, and (3) a structure-aware refinement module that employs edge connection to link gesture keypoints to improve video generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Contextual Gesture not only produces realistic and speech-aligned gesture videos but also supports long-sequence generation and video gesture editing applications, shown in Fig.1.

Abstract: Understanding and forecasting future scene states is critical for autonomous agents to plan and act effectively in complex environments. Object-centric models, with structured latent spaces, have shown promise in modeling object dynamics and predicting future scene states, but often struggle to scale beyond simple synthetic datasets and to integrate external guidance, limiting their applicability in robotics. To address these limitations, we propose TextOCVP, an object-centric model for video prediction guided by textual descriptions. TextOCVP parses an observed scene into object representations, called slots, and utilizes a text-conditioned transformer predictor to forecast future object states and video frames. Our approach jointly models object dynamics and interactions while incorporating textual guidance, enabling accurate and controllable predictions. TextOCVP's structured latent space offers a more precise control of the forecasting process, outperforming several video prediction baselines on two datasets. Additionally, we show that structured object-centric representations provide superior robustness to novel scene configurations, as well as improved controllability and interpretability, enabling more precise and understandable predictions. Videos and code are available at https://play-slot.github.io/TextOCVP.

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) develop, their potential security issues have become increasingly prominent. Machine Unlearning (MU), as an effective strategy for forgetting specific knowledge in training data, has been widely used in privacy protection. However, MU for safety in MLLM has yet to be fully explored. To address this issue, we propose SAFEERASER, a safety unlearning benchmark for MLLMs, consisting of 3,000 images and 28.8K VQA pairs. We comprehensively evaluate unlearning methods from two perspectives: forget quality and model utility. Our findings show that existing MU methods struggle to maintain model performance while implementing the forget operation and often suffer from over-forgetting. Hence, we introduce Prompt Decouple (PD) Loss to alleviate over-forgetting through decouple prompt during unlearning process. To quantitatively measure over-forgetting mitigated by PD Loss, we propose a new metric called Safe Answer Refusal Rate (SARR). Experimental results demonstrate that combining PD Loss with existing unlearning methods can effectively prevent over-forgetting and achieve a decrease of 79.5% in the SARR metric of LLaVA-7B and LLaVA-13B, while maintaining forget quality and model utility. Our code and dataset will be released upon acceptance. Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful language and images, and reader discretion is recommended.

Abstract: The emergence of large Vision Language Models (VLMs) has broadened the scope and capabilities of single-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating visual modalities, thereby unlocking transformative cross-modal applications in a variety of real-world scenarios. Despite their impressive performance, VLMs are prone to significant hallucinations, particularly in the form of cross-modal inconsistencies. Building on the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in aligning LLMs, recent advancements have focused on applying direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated datasets to mitigate these issues. Yet, such approaches typically introduce preference signals in a brute-force manner, neglecting the crucial role of visual information in the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Re-Align, a novel alignment framework that leverages image retrieval to construct a dual-preference dataset, effectively incorporating both textual and visual preference signals. We further introduce rDPO, an extension of the standard direct preference optimization that incorporates an additional visual preference objective during fine-tuning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Re-Align not only mitigates hallucinations more effectively than previous methods but also yields significant performance gains in general visual question-answering (VQA) tasks. Moreover, we show that Re-Align maintains robustness and scalability across a wide range of VLM sizes and architectures. This work represents a significant step forward in aligning multimodal LLMs, paving the way for more reliable and effective cross-modal applications. We release all the code in https://github.com/taco-group/Re-Align.

Abstract: While pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP exhibit impressive representational capabilities for multimodal data, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks. To alleviate the threat, existing defense strategies primarily focus on fine-tuning the entire suspicious model. However, the substantial model parameters increase the difficulty of reaching a stable and consistent optimization direction, limiting their resistance against state-of-the-art attacks and often resulting in a degradation of clean accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose Class-wise Backdoor Prompt Tuning (CBPT), an efficient and effective defense mechanism that operates on text prompts to indirectly purify poisoned CLIP. Specifically, we first employ the advanced contrastive learning via carefully crafted positive and negative samples, to effectively invert the backdoor triggers that are potentially adopted by the attacker. Once the dummy trigger is established, we leverage three well-designed loss functions to optimize these class-wise text prompts, modifying the model's decision boundary and further reclassifying the feature regions affected by backdoor triggers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CBPT significantly mitigates backdoor threats while preserving model utility, e.g. an average Clean Accuracy (CA) of 58.83% and an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 0.39% across seven mainstream backdoor attacks. These results underscore the superiority of our prompt purifying design to strengthen CLIP's robustness against backdoor attacks.

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks have now reached human-level performance across a variety of tasks. However, unlike humans they lack the ability to explain their decisions by showing where and telling what concepts guided them. In this work, we present a unified framework for transforming any vision neural network into a spatially and conceptually interpretable model. We introduce a spatially-aware concept bottleneck layer that projects "black-box" features of pre-trained backbone models into interpretable concept maps, without requiring human labels. By training a classification layer over this bottleneck, we obtain a self-explaining model that articulates which concepts most influenced its prediction, along with heatmaps that ground them in the input image. Accordingly, we name this method "Spatially-Aware and Label-Free Concept Bottleneck Model" (SALF-CBM). Our results show that the proposed SALF-CBM: (1) Outperforms non-spatial CBM methods, as well as the original backbone, on a variety of classification tasks; (2) Produces high-quality spatial explanations, outperforming widely used heatmap-based methods on a zero-shot segmentation task; (3) Facilitates model exploration and debugging, enabling users to query specific image regions and refine the model's decisions by locally editing its concept maps.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become powerful and widely adopted in some practical applications. However, recent research has revealed their vulnerability to multimodal jailbreak attacks, whereby the model can be induced to generate harmful content, leading to safety risks. Although most MLLMs have undergone safety alignment, recent research shows that the visual modality is still vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. In our work, we discover that by using flowcharts with partially harmful information, MLLMs can be induced to provide additional harmful details. Based on this, we propose a jailbreak attack method based on auto-generated flowcharts, FC-Attack. Specifically, FC-Attack first fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM to create a step-description generator based on benign datasets. The generator is then used to produce step descriptions corresponding to a harmful query, which are transformed into flowcharts in 3 different shapes (vertical, horizontal, and S-shaped) as visual prompts. These flowcharts are then combined with a benign textual prompt to execute the jailbreak attack on MLLMs. Our evaluations on Advbench show that FC-Attack attains an attack success rate of up to 96% via images and up to 78% via videos across multiple MLLMs. Additionally, we investigate factors affecting the attack performance, including the number of steps and the font styles in the flowcharts. We also find that FC-Attack can improve the jailbreak performance from 4% to 28% in Claude-3.5 by changing the font style. To mitigate the attack, we explore several defenses and find that AdaShield can largely reduce the jailbreak performance but with the cost of utility drop.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for video analysis and surveillance in computer vision. However, existing VAD models rely on learned normal patterns, which makes them difficult to apply to diverse environments. Consequently, users should retrain models or develop separate AI models for new environments, which requires expertise in machine learning, high-performance hardware, and extensive data collection, limiting the practical usability of VAD. To address these challenges, this study proposes customizable video anomaly detection (C-VAD) technique and the AnyAnomaly model. C-VAD considers user-defined text as an abnormal event and detects frames containing a specified event in a video. We effectively implemented AnyAnomaly using a context-aware visual question answering without fine-tuning the large vision language model. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, we constructed C-VAD datasets and demonstrated the superiority of AnyAnomaly. Furthermore, our approach showed competitive results on VAD benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on UBnormal and UCF-Crime and surpassing other methods in generalization across all datasets. Our code is available online at github.com/SkiddieAhn/Paper-AnyAnomaly.

Abstract: Assessing the quality of automatic image segmentation is crucial in clinical practice, but often very challenging due to the limited availability of ground truth annotations. Reverse Classification Accuracy (RCA) is an approach that estimates the quality of new predictions on unseen samples by training a segmenter on those predictions, and then evaluating it against existing annotated images. In this work, we introduce Conformal In-Context RCA, a novel method for automatically estimating segmentation quality with statistical guarantees in the absence of ground-truth annotations, which consists of two main innovations. First, In-Context RCA, which leverages recent in-context learning models for image segmentation and incorporates retrieval-augmentation techniques to select the most relevant reference images. This approach enables efficient quality estimation with minimal reference data while avoiding the need of training additional models. Second, we introduce Conformal RCA, which extends both the original RCA framework and In-Context RCA to go beyond point estimation. Using tools from split conformal prediction, Conformal RCA produces prediction intervals for segmentation quality providing statistical guarantees that the true score lies within the estimated interval with a user-specified probability. Validated across 10 different medical imaging tasks in various organs and modalities, our methods demonstrate robust performance and computational efficiency, offering a promising solution for automated quality control in clinical workflows, where fast and reliable segmentation assessment is essential. The code is available at https://github.com/mcosarinsky/Conformal-In-Context-RCA.

Abstract: Low-light enhancement has wide applications in autonomous driving, 3D reconstruction, remote sensing, surveillance, and so on, which can significantly improve information utilization. However, most existing methods lack generalization and are limited to specific tasks such as image recovery. To address these issues, we propose Gated-Mechanism Mixture-of-Experts (GM-MoE), the first framework to introduce a mixture-of-experts network for low-light image enhancement. GM-MoE comprises a dynamic gated weight conditioning network and three sub-expert networks, each specializing in a distinct enhancement task. Combining a self-designed gated mechanism that dynamically adjusts the weights of the sub-expert networks for different data domains. Additionally, we integrate local and global feature fusion within sub-expert networks to enhance image quality by capturing multi-scale features. Experimental results demonstrate that the GM-MoE achieves superior generalization with respect to 25 compared approaches, reaching state-of-the-art performance on PSNR on 5 benchmarks and SSIM on 4 benchmarks, respectively.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are known to have an unstable generation process, where even small perturbations or shifts in the input noise can lead to significantly different outputs. This hinders their applicability in applications requiring consistent results. In this work, we redesign LDMs to enhance consistency by making them shift-equivariant. While introducing anti-aliasing operations can partially improve shift-equivariance, significant aliasing and inconsistency persist due to the unique challenges in LDMs, including 1) aliasing amplification during VAE training and multiple U-Net inferences, and 2) self-attention modules that inherently lack shift-equivariance. To address these issues, we redesign the attention modules to be shift-equivariant and propose an equivariance loss that effectively suppresses the frequency bandwidth of the features in the continuous domain. The resulting alias-free LDM (AF-LDM) achieves strong shift-equivariance and is also robust to irregular warping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AF-LDM produces significantly more consistent results than vanilla LDM across various applications, including video editing and image-to-image translation.

<title>SAM2-ELNet: Label Enhancement and Automatic Annotation for Remote Sensing Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Remote sensing image segmentation is crucial for environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and resource management, but its performance largely depends on the quality of the dataset. Although several high-quality datasets are broadly accessible, data scarcity remains for specialized tasks like marine oil spill segmentation. Such tasks still rely on manual annotation, which is both time-consuming and influenced by subjective human factors. The segment anything model 2 (SAM2) has strong potential as an automatic annotation framework but struggles to perform effectively on heterogeneous, low-contrast remote sensing imagery. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel label enhancement and automatic annotation framework, termed SAM2-ELNet (Enhancement and Labeling Network). Specifically, we employ the frozen Hiera backbone from the pretrained SAM2 as the encoder, while fine-tuning the adapter and decoder for different remote sensing tasks. In addition, the proposed framework includes a label quality evaluator for filtering, ensuring the reliability of the generated labels. We design a series of experiments targeting resource-limited remote sensing tasks and evaluate our method on two datasets: the Deep-SAR Oil Spill (SOS) dataset with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, and the CHN6-CUG Road dataset with Very High Resolution (VHR) optical imagery. The proposed framework can enhance coarse annotations and generate reliable training data under resource-limited conditions. Fine-tuned on only 30% of the training data, it generates automatically labeled data. A model trained solely on these achieves slightly lower performance than using the full original annotations, while greatly reducing labeling costs and offering a practical solution for large-scale remote sensing interpretation.

Abstract: Gait disorder recognition plays a crucial role in the early diagnosis and monitoring of movement disorders. Existing approaches, including spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs), often face high memory demands and struggle to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies, limiting their efficiency in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce DynSTG-Mamba (Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Mamba), a novel framework that combines DF-STGNN and STG-Mamba to enhance motion sequence modeling. The DF-STGNN incorporates a dynamic spatio-temporal filter that adaptively adjusts spatial connections between skeletal joints and temporal interactions across different movement phases. This approach ensures better feature propagation through dynamic graph structures by considering the hierarchical nature and dynamics of skeletal gait data. Meanwhile, STG-Mamba, an extension of Mamba adapted for skeletal motion data, ensures a continuous propagation of states, facilitating the capture of long-term dependencies while reducing computational complexity. To reduce the number of model parameters and computational costs while maintaining consistency, we propose Cross-Graph Relational Knowledge Distillation, a novel knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns relational information between teacher (large architecture) and student models (small architecture) while using shared memory. This ensures that the interactions and movement patterns of the joints are accurately preserved in the motion sequences. We validate our DynSTG-Mamba on KOA-NM, PD-WALK, and ATAXIA datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and Recall. Our results highlight the efficiency and robustness of our approach, offering a lightweight yet highly accurate solution for automated gait analysis and movement disorder assessment.

Abstract: Accurate organ segmentation is essential for clinical tasks such as radiotherapy planning and disease monitoring. Recent foundation models like MedSAM achieve strong results using point or bounding-box prompts but still require manual interaction. We propose DescriptorMedSAM, a lightweight extension of MedSAM that incorporates structured text prompts, ranging from simple organ names to combined shape and location descriptors to enable click-free segmentation. DescriptorMedSAM employs a CLIP text encoder to convert radiology-style descriptors into dense embeddings, which are fused with visual tokens via a cross-attention block and a multi-scale feature extractor. We designed four descriptor types: Name (N), Name + Shape (NS), Name + Location (NL), and Name + Shape + Location (NSL), and evaluated them on the FLARE 2022 dataset under zero-shot and few-shot settings, where organs unseen during training must be segmented with minimal additional data. NSL prompts achieved the highest performance, with a Dice score of 0.9405 under full supervision, a 76.31% zero-shot retention ratio, and a 97.02% retention ratio after fine-tuning with only 50 labeled slices per unseen organ. Adding shape and location cues consistently improved segmentation accuracy, especially for small or morphologically complex structures. We demonstrate that structured language prompts can effectively replace spatial interactions, delivering strong zero-shot performance and rapid few-shot adaptation. By quantifying the role of descriptor, this work lays the groundwork for scalable, prompt-aware segmentation models that generalize across diverse anatomical targets with minimal annotation effort.

Abstract: Token-based video representation has emerged as a promising approach for enabling large language models (LLMs) to interpret video content. However, existing token reduction techniques, such as pruning and merging, often disrupt essential positional embeddings and rely on continuous visual tokens sampled from nearby pixels with similar spatial-temporal locations. By removing only a small fraction of tokens, these methods still produce relatively lengthy continuous sequences, which falls short of the extreme compression required to balance computational efficiency and token count in video LLMs. In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Extreme Short Token Reduction, which aims to represent entire videos using a minimal set of discrete tokens. We propose VQToken, a neural discrete token representation framework that (i) applies adaptive vector quantization to continuous ViT embeddings to learn a compact codebook and (ii) preserves spatial-temporal positions via a token hash function by assigning each grid-level token to its nearest codebook entry. On the Extreme Short Token Reduction task, our VQToken compresses sequences to just 0.07 percent of their original length while incurring only a 0.66 percent drop in accuracy on the NextQA-MC benchmark. It also achieves comparable performance on ActNet-QA, Long Video Bench, and VideoMME. We further introduce the Token Information Density (TokDense) metric and formalize fixed-length and adaptive-length subtasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in both settings. Our approach dramatically lowers theoretical complexity, increases information density, drastically reduces token counts, and enables efficient video LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with prompt-driven methods gaining prominence due to their flexibility. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) excels at point-prompted segmentation, while text-based models, often leveraging powerful multimodal encoders like BEIT-3, provide rich semantic understanding. However, effectively combining these complementary modalities remains a challenge. This paper introduces BiPrompt-SAM, a novel dual-modal prompt segmentation framework employing an explicit selection mechanism. We leverage SAM's ability to generate multiple mask candidates from a single point prompt and use a text-guided mask (generated via EVF-SAM with BEIT-3) to select the point-generated mask that best aligns spatially, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU). This approach, interpretable as a simplified Mixture of Experts (MoE), effectively fuses spatial precision and semantic context without complex model modifications. Notably, our method achieves strong zero-shot performance on the Endovis17 medical dataset (89.55% mDice, 81.46% mIoU) using only a single point prompt per instance. This significantly reduces annotation burden compared to bounding boxes and aligns better with practical clinical workflows, demonstrating the method's effectiveness without domain-specific training. On the RefCOCO series, BiPrompt-SAM attained 87.1%, 86.5%, and 85.8% IoU, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Experiments show BiPrompt-SAM excels in scenarios requiring both spatial accuracy and semantic disambiguation, offering a simple, effective, and interpretable perspective on multi-modal prompt fusion.

Abstract: Redundancy of visual tokens in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) significantly reduces their computational efficiency. Recent approaches, such as resamplers and summarizers, have sought to reduce the number of visual tokens, but at the cost of visual reasoning ability. To address this, we propose LEO-MINI, a novel MLLM that significantly reduces the number of visual tokens and simultaneously boosts visual reasoning capabilities. For efficiency, LEO-MINI incorporates CoTR, a novel token reduction module to consolidate a large number of visual tokens into a smaller set of tokens, using the similarity between visual tokens, text tokens, and a compact learnable query. For effectiveness, to scale up the model's ability with minimal computational overhead, LEO-MINI employs MMoE, a novel mixture of multi-modal experts module. MMOE employs a set of LoRA experts with a novel router to switch between them based on the input text and visual tokens instead of only using the input hidden state. MMoE also includes a general LoRA expert that is always activated to learn general knowledge for LLM reasoning. For extracting richer visual features, MMOE employs a set of vision experts trained on diverse domain-specific data. To demonstrate LEO-MINI's improved efficiency and performance, we evaluate it against existing efficient MLLMs on various benchmark vision-language tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) is proved to be greatly valuable for enhancing the reasoning ability of LLMs. Researchers have been starting to apply RFT to MLLMs, hoping it will also enhance the capabilities of visual understanding. However, these works are at a very early stage and have not examined how suitable RFT actually is for visual tasks. In this work, we endeavor to understand the suitabilities and limitations of RFT for visual tasks, through experimental analysis and observations. We start by quantitative comparisons on various tasks, which shows RFT is generally better than SFT on visual tasks. %especially when the number of training samples are limited. To check whether such advantages are brought up by the reasoning process, we design a new reward that encourages the model to ``think'' more, whose results show more thinking can be beneficial for complicated tasks but harmful for simple tasks. We hope this study can provide more insight for the rapid advancements on this topic.

Abstract: Recent advances in Source-Free Unsupervised Video Domain Adaptation (SFUVDA) leverage vision-language models to enhance pseudo-label generation. However, challenges such as noisy pseudo-labels and over-confident predictions limit their effectiveness in adapting well across domains. We propose Co-STAR, a novel framework that integrates curriculum learning with collaborative self-training between a source-trained teacher and a contrastive vision-language model (CLIP). Our curriculum learning approach employs a reliability-based weight function that measures bidirectional prediction alignment between the teacher and CLIP, balancing between confident and uncertain predictions. This function preserves uncertainty for difficult samples, while prioritizing reliable pseudo-labels when the predictions from both models closely align. To further improve adaptation, we propose Adaptive Curriculum Regularization, which modifies the learning priority of samples in a probabilistic, adaptive manner based on their confidence scores and prediction stability, mitigating overfitting to noisy and over-confident samples. Extensive experiments across multiple video domain adaptation benchmarks demonstrate that Co-STAR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SFUVDA methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in natural-domain multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated effective spatial reasoning through visual and textual prompting. However, their direct transfer to remote sensing (RS) is hindered by heterogeneous sensing physics, diverse modalities, and unique spatial scales. Existing RS MLLMs are mainly limited to optical imagery and plain language interaction, preventing flexible and scalable real-world applications. In this article, EarthGPT-X is proposed, the first flexible spatial MLLM that unifies multi-source RS imagery comprehension and accomplishes both coarse-grained and fine-grained visual tasks under diverse visual prompts in a single framework. Distinct from prior models, EarthGPT-X introduces: 1) a dual-prompt mechanism combining text instructions with various visual prompts (i.e., point, box, and free-form) to mimic the versatility of referring in human life; 2) a comprehensive multi-source multi-level prompting dataset, the model advances beyond holistic image understanding to support hierarchical spatial reasoning, including scene-level understanding and fine-grained object attributes and relational analysis; 3) a cross-domain one-stage fusion training strategy, enabling efficient and consistent alignment across modalities and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EarthGPT-X substantially outperforms prior nature and RS MLLMs, establishing the first framework capable of multi-source, multi-task, and multi-level interpretation using visual prompting in RS scenarios.

Abstract: Camera and human motion controls have been extensively studied for video generation, but existing approaches typically address them separately, suffering from limited data with high-quality annotations for both aspects. To overcome this, we present Uni3C, a unified 3D-enhanced framework for precise control of both camera and human motion in video generation. Uni3C includes two key contributions. First, we propose a plug-and-play control module trained with a frozen video generative backbone, PCDController, which utilizes unprojected point clouds from monocular depth to achieve accurate camera control. By leveraging the strong 3D priors of point clouds and the powerful capacities of video foundational models, PCDController shows impressive generalization, performing well regardless of whether the inference backbone is frozen or fine-tuned. This flexibility enables different modules of Uni3C to be trained in specific domains, i.e., either camera control or human motion control, reducing the dependency on jointly annotated data. Second, we propose a jointly aligned 3D world guidance for the inference phase that seamlessly integrates both scenic point clouds and SMPL-X characters to unify the control signals for camera and human motion, respectively. Extensive experiments confirm that PCDController enjoys strong robustness in driving camera motion for fine-tuned backbones of video generation. Uni3C substantially outperforms competitors in both camera controllability and human motion quality. Additionally, we collect tailored validation sets featuring challenging camera movements and human actions to validate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized video generation, offering superior temporal consistency and visual quality compared to traditional generative adversarial networks-based approaches. While this emerging field shows tremendous promise in applications, it faces significant challenges in motion consistency, computational efficiency, and ethical considerations. This survey provides a comprehensive review of diffusion-based video generation, examining its evolution, technical foundations, and practical applications. We present a systematic taxonomy of current methodologies, analyze architectural innovations and optimization strategies, and investigate applications across low-level vision tasks such as denoising and super-resolution. Additionally, we explore the synergies between diffusionbased video generation and related domains, including video representation learning, question answering, and retrieval. Compared to the existing surveys (Lei et al., 2024a;b; Melnik et al., 2024; Cao et al., 2023; Xing et al., 2024c) which focus on specific aspects of video generation, such as human video synthesis (Lei et al., 2024a) or long-form content generation (Lei et al., 2024b), our work provides a broader, more updated, and more fine-grained perspective on diffusion-based approaches with a special section for evaluation metrics, industry solutions, and training engineering techniques in video generation. This survey serves as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of diffusion models and video generation, providing insights into both the theoretical frameworks and practical implementations that drive this rapidly evolving field. A structured list of related works involved in this survey is also available on https://github.com/Eyeline-Research/Survey-Video-Diffusion.

Abstract: The hyperscaling of data and parameter count in transformer models is yielding diminishing performance improvement, especially when weighed against training costs. Such plateauing underlines a growing need for more efficient finetuning and inference, without sacrificing performance. This is particularly pressing for multimodal learning, where the overhead of processing multimodal tokens alongside language data often limits the practical viability of these systems. In parallel, advances in representation learning and interpretability have deepened our understanding of how such models process and encode information. Notably, recent work has uncovered implicit cross-modal alignment in the deeper layers of large pretrained models. Interestingly, this aligns with our own observations that models naturally defer most cross-modal token interactions to deeper stages of computation. Building on this, we propose a simple modification. Instead of concatenation with the language prompt at the start, we insert multimodal tokens directly into the middle, allowing them to entirely bypass the early layers. Our results with diverse modalities: 1) LLaVA \& BLIP for vision, 2) LTU for audio, and 3) MoLCA for molecular data, indicate that our method reduces computational costs during both training and inference, while at the very least, preserving, if not surpassing the performance of existing baselines. Our work has important implications for scaling and composing pretrained models in a resource-efficient manner.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing enables precise modifications via natural language prompts, but existing methods face a precision-efficiency tradeoff: fine-tuning demands massive datasets (>10M) and computational resources, while training-free approaches suffer from weak instruction comprehension. We address this by proposing ICEdit, which leverages the inherent comprehension and generation abilities of large-scale Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) through three key innovations: (1) An in-context editing paradigm without architectural modifications; (2) Minimal parameter-efficient fine-tuning for quality improvement; (3) Early Filter Inference-Time Scaling, which uses VLMs to select high-quality noise samples for efficiency. Experiments show that ICEdit achieves state-of-the-art editing performance with only 0.1\% of the training data and 1\% trainable parameters compared to previous methods. Our approach establishes a new paradigm for balancing precision and efficiency in instructional image editing. Codes and demos can be found in https://river-zhang.github.io/ICEdit-gh-pages/.

Abstract: Garment sewing patterns are fundamental design elements that bridge the gap between design concepts and practical manufacturing. The generative modeling of sewing patterns is crucial for creating diversified garments. However, existing approaches are limited either by reliance on a single input modality or by suboptimal generation efficiency. In this work, we present GarmentDiffusion, a new generative model capable of producing centimeter-precise, vectorized 3D sewing patterns from multimodal inputs (text, image, and incomplete sewing pattern). Our method efficiently encodes 3D sewing pattern parameters into compact edge token representations, achieving a sequence length that is 10 times shorter than that of the autoregressive SewingGPT in DressCode. By employing a diffusion transformer, we simultaneously denoise all edge tokens along the temporal axis, while maintaining a constant number of denoising steps regardless of dataset-specific edge and panel statistics. With all combination of designs of our model, the sewing pattern generation speed is accelerated by 100 times compared to SewingGPT. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on DressCodeData, as well as on the largest sewing pattern dataset, namely GarmentCodeData.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the task of script-driven video summarization, which aims to produce a summary of the full-length video by selecting the parts that are most relevant to a user-provided script outlining the visual content of the desired summary. Following, we extend a recently-introduced large-scale dataset for generic video summarization (VideoXum) by producing natural language descriptions of the different human-annotated summaries that are available per video. In this way we make it compatible with the introduced task, since the available triplets of ``video, summary and summary description'' can be used for training a method that is able to produce different summaries for a given video, driven by the provided script about the content of each summary. Finally, we develop a new network architecture for script-driven video summarization (SD-VSum), that employs a cross-modal attention mechanism for aligning and fusing information from the visual and text modalities. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the advanced performance of SD-VSum against SOTA approaches for query-driven and generic (unimodal and multimodal) summarization from the literature, and document its capacity to produce video summaries that are adapted to each user's needs about their content.

Abstract: Reliable three-dimensional human pose estimation (3D HPE) remains challenging due to the differences in viewpoints, environments, and camera conventions among datasets. As a result, methods that achieve near-optimal in-dataset accuracy often degrade on unseen datasets. In practice, however, systems must adapt to diverse viewpoints, environments, and camera setups--conditions that differ significantly from those encountered during training, which is often the case in real-world scenarios. Measuring cross-dataset performance is a vital process, but extremely labor-intensive when done manually for human pose estimation. To address these challenges, we automate this evaluation using PoseBench3D, a standardized testing framework that enables consistent and fair cross-dataset comparisons on previously unseen data. PoseBench3D streamlines testing across four widely used 3D HPE datasets via a single, configurable interface. Using this framework, we re-evaluate 18 methods and report over 100 cross-dataset results under Protocol 1: MPJPE and Protocol 2: PA-MPJPE, revealing systematic generalization gaps and the impact of common preprocessing and dataset setup choices.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT), a promising diffusion model for visual generation, demonstrates impressive performance but incurs significant computational overhead. Intriguingly, analysis of pre-trained DiT models reveals that global self-attention is often redundant, predominantly capturing local patterns-highlighting the potential for more efficient alternatives. In this paper, we revisit convolution as an alternative building block for constructing efficient and expressive diffusion models. However, naively replacing self-attention with convolution typically results in degraded performance. Our investigations attribute this performance gap to the higher channel redundancy in ConvNets compared to Transformers. To resolve this, we introduce a compact channel attention mechanism that promotes the activation of more diverse channels, thereby enhancing feature diversity. This leads to Diffusion ConvNet (DiCo), a family of diffusion models built entirely from standard ConvNet modules, offering strong generative performance with significant efficiency gains. On class-conditional ImageNet generation benchmarks, DiCo-XL achieves an FID of 2.05 at 256x256 resolution and 2.53 at 512x512, with a 2.7x and 3.1x speedup over DiT-XL/2, respectively. Furthermore, experimental results on MS-COCO demonstrate that the purely convolutional DiCo exhibits strong potential for text-to-image generation. Code: https://github.com/shallowdream204/DiCo.

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis. Yet, their substantial computational and memory demands pose serious challenges to real-world deployment, even on high-end GPUs. As a commonly adopted solution, quantization has proven notable success in reducing cost for image DMs, while its direct application to video DMs remains ineffective. In this paper, we present QVGen, a novel quantization-aware training (QAT) framework tailored for high-performance and inference-efficient video DMs under extremely low-bit quantization (e.g., 4-bit or below). We begin with a theoretical analysis demonstrating that reducing the gradient norm is essential to facilitate convergence for QAT. To this end, we introduce auxiliary modules ($\Phi$) to mitigate large quantization errors, leading to significantly enhanced convergence. To eliminate the inference overhead of $\Phi$, we propose a rank-decay strategy that progressively eliminates $\Phi$. Specifically, we repeatedly employ singular value decomposition (SVD) and a proposed rank-based regularization $\mathbf{\gamma}$ to identify and decay low-contributing components. This strategy retains performance while zeroing out inference overhead. Extensive experiments across $4$ state-of-the-art (SOTA) video DMs, with parameter sizes ranging from $1.3$B $\sim14$B, show that QVGen is the first to reach full-precision comparable quality under 4-bit settings. Moreover, it significantly outperforms existing methods. For instance, our 3-bit CogVideoX-2B achieves improvements of $+25.28$ in Dynamic Degree and $+8.43$ in Scene Consistency on VBench.

<title>VideoRFT: Incentivizing Video Reasoning Capability in MLLMs via Reinforced Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has shown great promise in achieving humanlevel reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), and has recently been extended to MLLMs. Nevertheless, reasoning about videos, which is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, remains a persistent challenge due to the complex logic, temporal and causal structures inherent in video data. To fill this gap, we propose VIDEORFT, a novel approach that extends the RFT paradigm to cultivate human-like video reasoning capabilities in MLLMs. VIDEORFT follows the standard two-stage scheme in RFT: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to improve generalization. A central challenge to achieve this in the video domain lies in the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality video CoT datasets. We address this by building a multi-expert, cognition-inspired CoT curation pipeline. First, we devise a cognition-inspired prompting strategy to elicit a reasoning LLM to generate preliminary CoTs based solely on rich, structured, and literal representations of video content. Subsequently, these CoTs are revised by a MLLM conditioned on the actual video, ensuring visual consistency and reducing visual hallucinations. This pipeline results in two new datasets, i.e.VideoRFT-CoT-102K for SFT and VideoRFT-RL-310K for RL. To further strengthen the RL phase, we introduce a novel semantic-consistency reward that explicitly promotes the alignment between textual reasoning and visual evidence. This reward encourages the model to produce coherent, context-aware reasoning outputs grounded in visual input. Extensive experiments show that VIDEORFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six video reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: The explosive growth of generative video models has amplified the demand for reliable copyright preservation of AI-generated content. Despite its popularity in image synthesis, invisible generative watermarking remains largely underexplored in video generation. To address this gap, we propose Safe-Sora, the first framework to embed graphical watermarks directly into the video generation process. Motivated by the observation that watermarking performance is closely tied to the visual similarity between the watermark and cover content, we introduce a hierarchical coarse-to-fine adaptive matching mechanism. Specifically, the watermark image is divided into patches, each assigned to the most visually similar video frame, and further localized to the optimal spatial region for seamless embedding. To enable spatiotemporal fusion of watermark patches across video frames, we develop a 3D wavelet transform-enhanced Mamba architecture with a novel spatiotemporal local scanning strategy, effectively modeling long-range dependencies during watermark embedding and retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply state space models to watermarking, opening new avenues for efficient and robust watermark protection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Safe-Sora achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of video quality, watermark fidelity, and robustness, which is largely attributed to our proposals.

<title>DD-Ranking: Rethinking the Evaluation of Dataset Distillation</title>

Abstract: In recent years, dataset distillation has provided a reliable solution for data compression, where models trained on the resulting smaller synthetic datasets achieve performance comparable to those trained on the original datasets. To further improve the performance of synthetic datasets, various training pipelines and optimization objectives have been proposed, greatly advancing the field of dataset distillation. Recent decoupled dataset distillation methods introduce soft labels and stronger data augmentation during the post-evaluation phase and scale dataset distillation up to larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet-1K). However, this raises a question: Is accuracy still a reliable metric to fairly evaluate dataset distillation methods? Our empirical findings suggest that the performance improvements of these methods often stem from additional techniques rather than the inherent quality of the images themselves, with even randomly sampled images achieving superior results. Such misaligned evaluation settings severely hinder the development of DD. Therefore, we propose DD-Ranking, a unified evaluation framework, along with new general evaluation metrics to uncover the true performance improvements achieved by different methods. By refocusing on the actual information enhancement of distilled datasets, DD-Ranking provides a more comprehensive and fair evaluation standard for future research advancements.

Abstract: Due to the powerful vision-language reasoning and generalization abilities, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have garnered significant attention in the field of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, their application to closed-loop systems remains underexplored, and current MLLM-based methods have not shown clear superiority to mainstream E2E imitation learning approaches. In this work, we propose ReasonPlan, a novel MLLM fine-tuning framework designed for closed-loop driving through holistic reasoning with a self-supervised Next Scene Prediction task and supervised Decision Chain-of-Thought process. This dual mechanism encourages the model to align visual representations with actionable driving context, while promoting interpretable and causally grounded decision making. We curate a planning-oriented decision reasoning dataset, namely PDR, comprising 210k diverse and high-quality samples. Our method outperforms the mainstream E2E imitation learning method by a large margin of 19% L2 and 16.1 driving score on Bench2Drive benchmark. Furthermore, ReasonPlan demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on unseen DOS benchmark, highlighting its adaptability in handling zero-shot corner cases. Code and dataset will be found in https://github.com/Liuxueyi/ReasonPlan.

Abstract: Traditional photography composition approaches are dominated by 2D cropping-based methods. However, these methods fall short when scenes contain poorly arranged subjects. Professional photographers often employ perspective adjustment as a form of 3D recomposition, modifying the projected 2D relationships between subjects while maintaining their actual spatial positions to achieve better compositional balance. Inspired by this artistic practice, we propose photography perspective composition (PPC), extending beyond traditional cropping-based methods. However, implementing the PPC faces significant challenges: the scarcity of perspective transformation datasets and undefined assessment criteria for perspective quality. To address these challenges, we present three key contributions: (1) An automated framework for building PPC datasets through expert photographs. (2) A video generation approach that demonstrates the transformation process from suboptimal to optimal perspectives. (3) A perspective quality assessment (PQA) model constructed based on human performance. Our approach is concise and requires no additional prompt instructions or camera trajectories, helping and guiding ordinary users to enhance their composition skills.

<title>How Much Do Large Language Models Know about Human Motion? A Case Study in 3D Avatar Control</title>

Abstract: We explore the human motion knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) through 3D avatar control. Given a motion instruction, we prompt LLMs to first generate a high-level movement plan with consecutive steps (High-level Planning), then specify body part positions in each step (Low-level Planning), which we linearly interpolate into avatar animations. Using 20 representative motion instructions that cover fundamental movements and balance body part usage, we conduct comprehensive evaluations, including human and automatic scoring of both high-level movement plans and generated animations, as well as automatic comparison with oracle positions in low-level planning. Our findings show that LLMs are strong at interpreting high-level body movements but struggle with precise body part positioning. While decomposing motion queries into atomic components improves planning, LLMs face challenges in multi-step movements involving high-degree-of-freedom body parts. Furthermore, LLMs provide reasonable approximations for general spatial descriptions, but fall short in handling precise spatial specifications. Notably, LLMs demonstrate promise in conceptualizing creative motions and distinguishing culturally specific motion patterns.

Abstract: Complete blood cell detection holds significant value in clinical diagnostics. Conventional manual microscopy methods suffer from time inefficiency and diagnostic inaccuracies. Existing automated detection approaches remain constrained by high deployment costs and suboptimal accuracy. While deep learning has introduced powerful paradigms to this field, persistent challenges in detecting overlapping cells and multi-scale objects hinder practical deployment. This study proposes the multi-scale YOLO (MS-YOLO), a blood cell detection model based on the YOLOv11 framework, incorporating three key architectural innovations to enhance detection performance. Specifically, the multi-scale dilated residual module (MS-DRM) replaces the original C3K2 modules to improve multi-scale discriminability; the dynamic cross-path feature enhancement module (DCFEM) enables the fusion of hierarchical features from the backbone with aggregated features from the neck to enhance feature representations; and the light adaptive-weight downsampling module (LADS) improves feature downsampling through adaptive spatial weighting while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the CBC benchmark demonstrate that MS-YOLO achieves precise detection of overlapping cells and multi-scale objects, particularly small targets such as platelets, achieving an mAP@50 of 97.4% that outperforms existing models. Further validation on the supplementary WBCDD dataset confirms its robust generalization capability. Additionally, with a lightweight architecture and real-time inference efficiency, MS-YOLO meets clinical deployment requirements, providing reliable technical support for standardized blood pathology assessment.

Abstract: Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across multiple tasks. However, their trustworthiness is often challenged by hallucinations, which can be attributed to the modality misalignment and the inherent hallucinations of their underlying Large Language Models (LLMs) backbone. Existing preference alignment methods focus on aligning model responses with human preferences while neglecting image-text modality alignment, resulting in over-reliance on LLMs and hallucinations. In this paper, we propose Entity-centric Multimodal Preference Optimization (EMPO), which achieves enhanced modality alignment compared to existing human preference alignment methods. Besides, to overcome the scarcity of high-quality multimodal preference data, we utilize open-source instruction datasets to automatically construct high-quality preference data across three aspects: image, instruction, and response. Experiments on two human preference datasets and five multimodal hallucination benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of EMPO, e.g., reducing hallucination rates by 85.9\% on Object-HalBench and 49.8\% on MM-HalBench.

Abstract: Despite Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP)'s remarkable capability to retrieve content across modalities, a substantial modality gap persists in its feature space. Intriguingly, we discover that off-the-shelf MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) demonstrate powerful inherent modality alignment properties. While recent MLLM-based retrievers with unified architectures partially mitigate this gap, their reliance on coarse modality alignment mechanisms fundamentally limits their potential. In this work, We introduce MAPLE (Modality-Aligned Preference Learning for Embeddings), a novel framework that leverages the fine grained alignment priors inherent in MLLM to guide cross modal representation learning. MAPLE formulates the learning process as reinforcement learning with two key components: (1) Automatic preference data construction using off-the-shelf MLLM, and (2) a new Relative Preference Alignment (RPA) loss, which adapts Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to the embedding learning setting. Experimental results show that our preference-guided alignment achieves substantial gains in fine-grained cross-modal retrieval, underscoring its effectiveness in handling nuanced semantic distinctions.

Abstract: Transformer models achieve excellent scaling property, where the performance is improved with the increment of model capacity. However, large-scale model parameters lead to an unaffordable cost of computing and memory. We analyze popular transformer architectures and find that multilayer perceptron (MLP) modules take up the majority of model parameters. To this end, we focus on the recoverability of the compressed models and propose a Diversity-Guided MLP Reduction (DGMR) method to significantly reduce the parameters of large vision transformers with only negligible performance degradation. Specifically, we conduct a Gram-Schmidt weight pruning strategy to eliminate redundant neurons of MLP hidden layer, while preserving weight diversity for better performance recover during distillation. Compared to the model trained from scratch, our pruned model only requires 0.06\% data of LAION-2B (for the training of large vision transformers) without labels (ImageNet-1K) to recover the original performance. Experimental results on several state-of-the-art large vision transformers demonstrate that our method achieves a more than 57.0\% parameter and FLOPs reduction in a near lossless manner. Notably, for EVA-CLIP-E (4.4B), our method accomplishes a 71.5\% parameter and FLOPs reduction without performance degradation. The source code and trained weights are available at https://github.com/visresearch/DGMR.

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition aims to convert visual input into machine-readable text, and it remains challenging due to the evolving and context-dependent nature of handwriting. Character sets change over time, and character frequency distributions shift across historical periods or regions, often causing models trained on broad, heterogeneous corpora to underperform on specific subsets. To tackle this, we propose a novel loss function that incorporates the Wasserstein distance between the character frequency distribution of the predicted text and a target distribution empirically derived from training data. By penalizing divergence from expected distributions, our approach enhances both accuracy and robustness under temporal and contextual intra-dataset shifts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that character distribution alignment can also improve existing models at inference time without requiring retraining by integrating it as a scoring function in a guided decoding scheme. Experimental results across multiple datasets and architectures confirm the effectiveness of our method in boosting generalization and performance. We open source our code at https://github.com/pkaliosis/fada.

Abstract: Dataset bias often leads deep learning models to exploit spurious correlations instead of task-relevant signals. We introduce the Standard Anti-Causal Model (SAM), a unifying causal framework that characterizes bias mechanisms and yields a conditional independence criterion for causal stability. Building on this theory, we propose DISCO$_m$ and sDISCO, efficient and scalable estimators of conditional distance correlation that enable independence regularization in black-box models. Across five diverse datasets, our methods consistently outperform or are competitive in existing bias mitigation approaches, while requiring fewer hyperparameters and scaling seamlessly to multi-bias scenarios. This work bridges causal theory and practical deep learning, providing both a principled foundation and effective tools for robust prediction. Source Code: https://github.com/***.

Abstract: Mosquito-borne diseases pose a major global health risk, requiring early detection and proactive control of breeding sites to prevent outbreaks. In this paper, we present VisText-Mosquito, a multimodal dataset that integrates visual and textual data to support automated detection, segmentation, and reasoning for mosquito breeding site analysis. The dataset includes 1,828 annotated images for object detection, 142 images for water surface segmentation, and natural language reasoning texts linked to each image. The YOLOv9s model achieves the highest precision of 0.92926 and mAP@50 of 0.92891 for object detection, while YOLOv11n-Seg reaches a segmentation precision of 0.91587 and mAP@50 of 0.79795. For reasoning generation, we tested a range of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our fine-tuned Mosquito-LLaMA3-8B model achieved the best results, with a final loss of 0.0028, a BLEU score of 54.7, BERTScore of 0.91, and ROUGE-L of 0.85. This dataset and model framework emphasize the theme "Prevention is Better than Cure", showcasing how AI-based detection can proactively address mosquito-borne disease risks.

Abstract: This paper presents improved native unified multimodal models, \emph{i.e.,} Show-o2, that leverage autoregressive modeling and flow matching. Built upon a 3D causal variational autoencoder space, unified visual representations are constructed through a dual-path of spatial (-temporal) fusion, enabling scalability across image and video modalities while ensuring effective multimodal understanding and generation. Based on a language model, autoregressive modeling and flow matching are natively applied to the language head and flow head, respectively, to facilitate text token prediction and image/video generation. A two-stage training recipe is designed to effectively learn and scale to larger models. The resulting Show-o2 models demonstrate versatility in handling a wide range of multimodal understanding and generation tasks across diverse modalities, including text, images, and videos.

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) enables precise object segmentation in images based on natural language descriptions, offering high flexibility and broad applicability in real-world vision tasks. Despite its impressive performance, the robustness of RES models against adversarial examples remains largely unexplored. While prior adversarial attack methods have explored adversarial robustness on conventional segmentation models, they perform poorly when directly applied to RES models, failing to expose vulnerabilities in its multimodal structure. In practical open-world scenarios, users typically issue multiple, diverse referring expressions to interact with the same image, highlighting the need for adversarial examples that generalize across varied textual inputs. Furthermore, from the perspective of privacy protection, ensuring that RES models do not segment sensitive content without explicit authorization is a crucial aspect of enhancing the robustness and security of multimodal vision-language systems. To address these challenges, we present PEAT, an Embedding-Guided Bidirectional Attack for RES models. Extensive experiments across multiple RES architectures and standard benchmarks show that PEAT consistently outperforms competitive baselines.

Abstract: Recent Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising capabilities in unifying visual understanding and generative modeling, enabling both accurate content understanding and flexible editing. However, current approaches treat "what to see" and "how to edit" separately: they either perform isolated object segmentation or utilize segmentation masks merely as conditional prompts for local edit generation tasks, often relying on multiple disjointed models. To bridge these gaps, we introduce FOCUS, a unified LVLM that integrates segmentation-aware perception and controllable object-centric generation within an end-to-end framework. FOCUS employs a dual-branch visual encoder to simultaneously capture global semantic context and fine-grained spatial details. In addition, we leverage a MoVQGAN-based visual tokenizer to produce discrete visual tokens that enhance generation quality. To enable accurate and controllable image editing, we propose a progressive multi-stage training pipeline, where segmentation masks are jointly optimized and used as spatial condition prompts to guide the diffusion decoder. This strategy aligns visual encoding, segmentation, and generation modules, effectively bridging segmentation-aware perception with fine-grained visual synthesis. Extensive experiments across three core tasks, including multimodal understanding, referring segmentation accuracy, and controllable image generation, demonstrate that FOCUS achieves strong performance by jointly optimizing visual perception and generative capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have enhanced document understanding by integrating textual and visual information. However, existing models exhibit incompleteness within their paradigm in real-world scenarios, particularly under visual degradation. In such conditions, the current response paradigm often fails to adequately perceive visual degradation and ambiguity, leading to overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned visual-textual reasoning. This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently results in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise answer is not feasible. To better demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon and problem, we propose KIE-HVQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating OCR hallucination in degraded document understanding. This dataset includes test samples spanning identity cards and invoices, with simulated real-world degradations for OCR reliability. This setup allows for evaluating models' capacity, under degraded input, to distinguish reliable visual information and answer accordingly, thereby highlighting the challenge of avoiding hallucination on uncertain data. To achieve vision-faithful reasoning and thereby avoid the aforementioned issues, we further introduce a GRPO-based framework featuring a novel reward mechanism. By incorporating a self-awareness of visual uncertainty and an analysis method that initiates refusal to answer to increase task difficulty within our supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning framework, we successfully mitigated hallucinations in ambiguous regions. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that our 7B-parameter model achieves a 22\% absolute improvement in hallucination-free accuracy over GPT-4o on KIE-HVQA and there is no significant performance drop in standard tasks, highlighting both effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Sequential grounding in 3D point clouds (SG3D) refers to locating sequences of objects by following text instructions for a daily activity with detailed steps. Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with multiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from each step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as "it", "here" and "the same" to make language expressions concise. This requires grounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information from previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an effective module for collecting related historical information, state-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the SG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for temporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we demonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG baseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\% and +10.2\%) in the SG3D benchmark, even outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets. Furthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step information based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling GroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain its temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work introduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves state-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of a subjective camera to reconstruct meaningful moments that physical cameras fail to capture. We propose Subjective Camera 1.0, a framework for reconstructing real-world scenes from readily accessible subjective readouts, i.e., textual descriptions and progressively drawn rough sketches. Built on optimization-based alignment of diffusion models, our approach avoids large-scale paired training data and mitigates generalization issues. To address the challenge of integrating multiple abstract concepts in real-world scenarios, we design a Sequence-Aware Sketch-Guided Diffusion framework with three loss terms for concept-wise sequential optimization, following the natural order of subjective readouts. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in image quality as well as spatial and semantic alignment with target scenes. User studies with 40 participants further confirm that our approach is consistently preferred. Our project page is at: subjective-camera.github.io

Abstract: Viewpoint missing of objects is common in scene reconstruction, as camera paths typically prioritize capturing the overall scene structure rather than individual objects. This makes it highly challenging to achieve high-fidelity object-level modeling while maintaining accurate scene-level representation. Addressing this issue is critical for advancing downstream tasks requiring high-fidelity object reconstruction. In this paper, we introduce Scene-Consistent Object Refinement via Proxy Generation and Tuning (SCORP), a novel 3D enhancement framework that leverages 3D generative priors to recover fine-grained object geometry and appearance under missing views. Starting with proxy generation by substituting degraded objects using a 3D generation model, SCORP then progressively refines geometry and texture by aligning each proxy to its degraded counterpart in 7-DoF pose, followed by correcting spatial and appearance inconsistencies through registration-constrained enhancement. This two-stage proxy tuning ensures the high-fidelity geometry and appearance of the original object in unseen views while maintaining consistency in spatial positioning, observed geometry, and appearance. Across challenging benchmarks, SCORP achieves consistent gains over recent state-of-the-art baselines on both novel view synthesis and geometry completion tasks.

Abstract: The remarkable reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) stems from cognitive behaviors that emerge through reinforcement with verifiable rewards. This work investigates how to transfer this principle to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to unlock advanced visual reasoning. We introduce a two-stage paradigm built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B: a massive linguistic cold-start fine-tuning, followed by multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) spanning nearly 1,000 steps, surpassing all previous open-source efforts in scale. This pioneering work reveals three fundamental insights: 1) Behavior transfer emerges surprisingly early in cold start due to linguistic mental imagery. 2) Cold start broadly memorizes visual behaviors, while RL critically discerns and scales up effective patterns. 3) Transfer strategically favors high-utility behaviors such as visual reflection. Our resulting model, Open-Vision-Reasoner (OVR), achieves state-of-the-art performance on a suite of reasoning benchmarks, including 95.3% on MATH500, 51.8% on MathVision and 54.6% on MathVerse. We release our model, data, and training dynamics to catalyze the development of more capable, behavior-aligned multimodal reasoners.

Abstract: Deep learning has driven significant advances in medical image analysis, yet its adoption in clinical practice remains constrained by the large size and lack of transparency in modern models. Advances in interpretability techniques such as DL-Backtrace, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, and Integrated Gradients make it possible to assess the contribution of individual components within neural networks trained on medical imaging tasks. In this work, we introduce an interpretability-guided pruning framework that reduces model complexity while preserving both predictive performance and transparency. By selectively retaining only the most relevant parts of each layer, our method enables targeted compression that maintains clinically meaningful representations. Experiments across multiple medical image classification benchmarks demonstrate that this approach achieves high compression rates with minimal loss in accuracy, paving the way for lightweight, interpretable models suited for real-world deployment in healthcare settings.

<title>DynFaceRestore: Balancing Fidelity and Quality in Diffusion-Guided Blind Face Restoration with Dynamic Blur-Level Mapping and Guidance</title>

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion, resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation leverages topological connectivity theory to enhance edge precision and regional consistency. However, existing deep networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by 1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU). The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical usability.

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.

Abstract: Image editing in rectified flow models remains challenging due to the fundamental trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and editing flexibility. While inversion-based methods suffer from trajectory deviation, recent inversion-free approaches like FlowEdit offer direct editing pathways but can benefit from additional guidance to improve structure preservation. In this work, we demonstrate that optimal transport theory provides a unified framework for improving both paradigms in rectified flow editing. We introduce a zero-shot transport-guided inversion framework that leverages optimal transport during the reverse diffusion process, and extend optimal transport principles to enhance inversion-free methods through transport-optimized velocity field corrections. Incorporating transport-based guidance can effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability across different rectified flow editing approaches. For inversion-based editing, our method achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, observing 7.8% to 12.9% improvements over RF-Inversion on LSUN datasets. For inversion-free editing with FlowEdit on FLUX and Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic consistency and structure preservation across diverse editing scenarios. Our semantic face editing experiments show an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and enhanced perceptual quality. The unified optimal transport framework produces visually compelling edits with superior detail preservation across both inversion-based and direct editing paradigms.

<title>LRQ-DiT: Log-Rotation Post-Training Quantization of Diffusion Transformers for Image and Video Generation</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in text-to-image and text-to-video generation. However, their high computational cost and large parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained scenarios. Effective compression of models has become a crucial issue that urgently needs to be addressed. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. After experiments and analysis, we identify two key obstacles to low-bit PTQ for DiTs: (1) the weights of DiT models follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant quantization errors. This issue has been observed in the linear layer weights of different DiT models, which deeply limits the performance. (2) two types of activation outliers in DiT models: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate post-training quantization framework for image and video generation. First, we introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that allocates more quantization intervals to the intermediate dense regions, effectively achieving alignment with the weight distribution and reducing quantization errors. Second, we propose an Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating the impact of both types of outliers.Extensive experiments on various text-to-image and text-to-video DiT models demonstrate that LRQ-DiT preserves high generation quality.

Abstract: Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches: sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming, we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces three key innovations: (i) a trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; (ii) a noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later phases; and (iii) a seed group strategy that controls for initialization effects to isolate exploration contributions. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art performance in human preference alignment and text-to-image benchmarks.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive performance (e.g., 90+% J&amp;F) on benchmarks such as DAVIS and YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, the coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1) dataset was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the foundations and insights of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and 701,976 high-quality masks for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2 introduces much greater scene complexity, including {more frequent object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g., rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows, reflections), and scenarios requiring external knowledge.} We benchmark 20 representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent performance drops on MOSEv2. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9% on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and observe similar declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 poses challenges across tasks. These results highlight that despite strong performance on existing datasets, current VOS methods still fall short under real-world complexities. Based on our analysis of the observed challenges, we further propose several practical tricks that enhance model performance. MOSEv2 is publicly available at https://MOSE.video.

<title>A Semantic Segmentation Algorithm for Pleural Effusion Based on DBIF-AUNet</title>

Abstract: Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness. Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.

Abstract: Pathological images play an essential role in cancer prognosis, while survival analysis, which integrates computational techniques, can predict critical clinical events such as patient mortality or disease recurrence from whole-slide images (WSIs). Recent advancements in multiple instance learning have significantly improved the efficiency of survival analysis. However, existing methods often struggle to balance the modeling of long-range spatial relationships with local contextual dependencies and typically lack inherent interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Pathology Graph-Transformer (IPGPhormer), a novel framework that captures the characteristics of the tumor microenvironment and models their spatial dependencies across the tissue. IPGPhormer uniquely provides interpretability at both tissue and cellular levels without requiring post-hoc manual annotations, enabling detailed analyses of individual WSIs and cross-cohort assessments. Comprehensive evaluations on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate that IPGPhormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In summary, our method, IPGPhormer, offers a promising tool for cancer prognosis assessment, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable decision-support systems in pathology. The code is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IPGPhormer-6EEB.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in novel view synthesis under dense-view settings. However, in sparse-view scenarios, despite the realistic renderings in training views, 3DGS occasionally manifests appearance artifacts in novel views. This paper investigates the appearance artifacts in sparse-view 3DGS and uncovers a core limitation of current approaches: the optimized Gaussians are overly-entangled with one another to aggressively fit the training views, which leads to a neglect of the real appearance distribution of the underlying scene and results in appearance artifacts in novel views. The analysis is based on a proposed metric, termed Co-Adaptation Score (CA), which quantifies the entanglement among Gaussians, i.e., co-adaptation, by computing the pixel-wise variance across multiple renderings of the same viewpoint, with different random subsets of Gaussians. The analysis reveals that the degree of co-adaptation is naturally alleviated as the number of training views increases. Based on the analysis, we propose two lightweight strategies to explicitly mitigate the co-adaptation in sparse-view 3DGS: (1) random gaussian dropout; (2) multiplicative noise injection to the opacity. Both strategies are designed to be plug-and-play, and their effectiveness is validated across various methods and benchmarks. We hope that our insights into the co-adaptation effect will inspire the community to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of sparse-view 3DGS.

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles, pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near, middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation. Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors, whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network. The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Abstract: Proper segmentation of organs-at-risk is important for radiation therapy, surgical planning, and diagnostic decision-making in medical image analysis. While deep learning-based segmentation architectures have made significant progress, they often fail to balance segmentation accuracy with computational efficiency. Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize performance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy for efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient dual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features a noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at training time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the noise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost. Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs), and Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature representation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale segmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss function to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA segmentation architectures on four publicly available medical imaging datasets. EDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse dataset, surpassing baseline model like UNet by 13.89% in Dice score while significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) by 89.7%. Compared to recent approaches like EMCAD, our EDLDNet not only achieves higher Dice score but also maintains comparable computational efficiency. The outstanding performance across diverse datasets establishes EDLDNet's strong generalization, computational efficiency, and robustness. The source code, pre-processed data, and pre-trained weights will be available at https://github.com/riadhassan/EDLDNet .

Abstract: Object hallucination in large vision-language models presents a significant challenge to their safe deployment in real-world applications. Recent works have proposed object-level hallucination scores to estimate the likelihood of object hallucination; however, these methods typically adopt either a global or local perspective in isolation, which may limit detection reliability. In this paper, we introduce GLSim, a novel training-free object hallucination detection framework that leverages complementary global and local embedding similarity signals between image and text modalities, enabling more accurate and reliable hallucination detection in diverse scenarios. We comprehensively benchmark existing object hallucination detection methods and demonstrate that GLSim achieves superior detection performance, outperforming competitive baselines by a significant margin.

All studies contain co-registered PET/CT scans with varying acquisition protocols, reflecting real-world clinical diversity from a long-term, multi-institution retrospective collection. Primary gross tumor volumes (GTVp) and involved lymph nodes (GTVn) were manually segmented by experienced radiation oncologists and radiologists following established guidelines. We provide anonymized NifTi files, expert-annotated segmentation masks, comprehensive clinical metadata, and radiotherapy dose distributions for a patient subset. The metadata include TNM staging, HPV status, demographics, long-term follow-up outcomes, survival times, censoring indicators, and treatment information. To demonstrate its utility, we benchmark three key clinical tasks: automated tumor segmentation, recurrence-free survival prediction, and HPV status classification, using state-of-the-art deep learning models like UNet, SegResNet, and multimodal prognostic frameworks.

Abstract: Visual prostheses hold great promise for restoring vision in blind individuals. While researchers have successfully utilized M/EEG signals to evoke visual perceptions during the brain decoding stage of visual prostheses, the complementary process of converting images into M/EEG signals in the brain encoding stage remains largely unexplored, hindering the formation of a complete functional pipeline. In this work, we present, to our knowledge, the first image-to-brain signal framework that generates M/EEG from images by leveraging denoising diffusion probabilistic models enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, the proposed framework comprises two key components: a pretrained CLIP visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images, and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that reconstructs brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for conditioning, our cross-attention modules capture the complex interplay between visual features and brain signal representations, enabling fine-grained alignment during generation. We evaluate the framework on two multimodal benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it generates biologically plausible brain signals. We also present visualizations of M/EEG topographies across all subjects in both datasets, providing intuitive demonstrations of intra-subject and inter-subject variations in brain signals.

<title>PPORLD-EDNetLDCT: A Proximal Policy Optimization-Based Reinforcement Learning Framework for Adaptive Low-Dose CT Denoising</title>

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality. Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback, trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods, achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achieved a PSNR of 41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to 94%, achieving 4% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based denoising.

<title>GeoSplat: A Deep Dive into Geometry-Constrained Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However, those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors (e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision. In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage, we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to distribution shifts caused by real-world degradations such as noise, blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we propose HyperTTA (Test-Time Adaptable Transformer for Hyperspectral Degradation), a unified framework that enhances model robustness under diverse degradation conditions. First, we construct a multi-degradation hyperspectral benchmark that systematically simulates nine representative degradations, enabling comprehensive evaluation of robust classification. Based on this benchmark, we develop a Spectral--Spatial Transformer Classifier (SSTC) with a multi-level receptive field mechanism and label smoothing regularization to capture multi-scale spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight test-time adaptation strategy, the Confidence-aware Entropy-minimized LayerNorm Adapter (CELA), which dynamically updates only the affine parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This strategy ensures reliable adaptation without access to source data or target labels. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios. Code will be made available publicly.

Abstract: Solving inverse problems \(Ax = y\) is central to a variety of practically important fields such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and non-destructive testing. The most successful and theoretically best-understood method is convex variational regularization, where approximate but stable solutions are defined as minimizers of \( \|A(\cdot) - y^\delta\|^2 / 2 + \alpha \mathcal{R}(\cdot)\), with \(\mathcal{R}\) a regularization functional. Recent methods such as deep equilibrium models and plug-and-play approaches, however, go beyond variational regularization. Motivated by these innovations, we introduce implicit non-variational (INV) regularization, where approximate solutions are defined as solutions of \(A^*(A x - y^\delta) + \alpha R(x) = 0\) for some regularization operator \(R\). When the regularization operator is the gradient of a functional, INV reduces to classical variational regularization. However, in methods like DEQ and PnP, \(R\) is not a gradient field, and the existing theoretical foundation remains incomplete. To address this, we establish stability and convergence results in this broader setting, including convergence rates and stability estimates measured via a absolute Bregman distance.

Abstract: Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women and a leading cause of mortality. Many attempts have been made to develop an effective Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system; however, their performance remains limited. Using pretrained ResNet-50/101/152, we propose a novel CAD system that significantly outperforms prior approaches.
  Our novel model has three key components. First, we extract detailed features (color, edges, and texture) from early convolution blocks and the abstract features (shapes and objects) from later blocks, as both are equally important. This dual-level feature extraction is a new paradigm in cancer classification. Second, a non-parametric 3D attention module is uniquely embedded within each block for feature enhancement. Third, we design a theoretically motivated innovative adaptive pooling strategy for feature selection that applies Global Max Pooling to detailed features and Global Average Pooling to abstract features. These components form our Proposed Block-Fused Attention-Driven Adaptively-Pooled ResNet (BF-AD-AP-ResNet) model. To further strengthen learning, we introduce a Tri-Stream model, which unifies the enhanced features from three BF-AD-AP-ResNets. An SVM classifier is employed for final classification.
  We evaluate our models on two public datasets, IARC and AnnoCerv. On IARC, the base ResNets achieve an average performance of 90.91%, while our model achieves an excellent performance of 98.63%. On AnnoCerv, the base ResNets reach to 87.68%, and our model improves this significantly, reaching 93.39%. Our approach outperforms the best existing method on IARC by an average of 14.55%. For AnnoCerv, no prior competitive works are available. Additionally, we introduce a novel SHAP+LIME explainability method, accurately identifying the cancerous region in 97% of cases, ensuring model reliability for real-world use.

<title>Reflecting on the State of Rehearsal-free Continual Learning with Pretrained Models</title>

arXiv:2406.09384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent and recent ubiquity of foundation models, continual learning (CL) has recently shifted from continual training from scratch to the continual adaptation of pretrained models, seeing particular success on rehearsal-free CL benchmarks (RFCL). To achieve this, most proposed methods adapt and restructure parameter-efficient finetuning techniques (PEFT) to suit the continual nature of the problem. Based most often on input-conditional query-mechanisms or regularizations on top of prompt- or adapter-based PEFT, these PEFT-style RFCL (P-RFCL) approaches report peak performances; often convincingly outperforming existing CL techniques. However, on the other end, critical studies have recently highlighted competitive results by training on just the first task or via simple non-parametric baselines. Consequently, questions arise about the relationship between methodological choices in P-RFCL and their reported high benchmark scores. In this work, we tackle these questions to better understand the true drivers behind strong P-RFCL performances, their placement w.r.t. recent first-task adaptation studies, and their relation to preceding CL standards such as EWC or SI. In particular, we show: (1) P-RFCL techniques relying on input-conditional query mechanisms work not because, but rather despite them by collapsing towards standard PEFT shortcut solutions. (2) Indeed, we show how most often, P-RFCL techniques can be matched by a simple and lightweight PEFT baseline. (3) Using this baseline, we identify the implicit bound on tunable parameters when deriving RFCL approaches from PEFT methods as a potential denominator behind P-RFCL efficacy. Finally, we (4) better disentangle continual versus first-task adaptation, and (5) motivate standard RFCL techniques s.a. EWC or SI in light of recent P-RFCL methods.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have recently achieved significant progress, demonstrating strong capabilities in open-world visual understanding. However, it is not yet clear how LVLMs address demographic biases in real life, especially the disparities across attributes such as gender, skin tone, age and race. In this paper, We empirically investigate \emph{visual fairness} in several mainstream LVLMs by auditing their performance disparities across demographic attributes using public fairness benchmark datasets (e.g., FACET, UTKFace). Our fairness evaluation framework employs direct and single-choice question prompt on visual question-answering/classification tasks. Despite advancements in visual understanding, our zero-shot prompting results show that both open-source and closed-source LVLMs continue to exhibit fairness issues across different prompts and demographic groups. Furthermore, we propose a potential multi-modal Chain-of-thought (CoT) based strategy for unfairness mitigation, applicable to both open-source and closed-source LVLMs. This approach enhances transparency and offers a scalable solution for addressing fairness, providing a solid foundation for future research and practical efforts in unfairness mitigation. The dataset and code used in this study are publicly available at this GitHub Repository.

Abstract: Despite their high accuracy, complex neural networks demand significant computational resources, posing challenges for deployment on resource constrained devices such as mobile phones and embedded systems. Compression algorithms have been developed to address these challenges by reducing model size and computational demands while maintaining accuracy. Among these approaches, factorization methods based on tensor decomposition are theoretically sound and effective. However, they face difficulties in selecting the appropriate rank for decomposition. This paper tackles this issue by presenting a unified framework that simultaneously applies decomposition and rank selection, employing a composite compression loss within defined rank constraints. Our method includes an automatic rank search in a continuous space, efficiently identifying optimal rank configurations for the pre-trained model by eliminating the need for additional training data and reducing computational overhead in the search step. Combined with a subsequent fine-tuning step, our approach maintains the performance of highly compressed models on par with their original counterparts. Using various benchmark datasets and models, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method through a comprehensive analysis.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant value in image registration, however, current techniques are either limited by the type and range of motion they can handle, or require iterative inference and/or retraining for new imaging data. To address these limitations, we introduce UniMo, a Unified Motion Correction framework that leverages deep neural networks to correct diverse motion in medical imaging. UniMo employs an alternating optimization scheme for a unified loss function to train an integrated model of 1) an equivariant neural network for global rigid motion correction and 2) an encoder-decoder network for local deformations. It features a geometric deformation augmenter that 1) enhances the robustness of global correction by addressing local deformations from non-rigid motion or geometric distortions, and 2) generates augmented data to improve training. UniMo is a hybrid model that uses both image intensities and shapes to achieve robust performance amid appearance variations, and therefore generalizes to multiple imaging modalities without retraining. We trained and tested UniMo to track motion in fetal magnetic resonance imaging, a challenging application due to 1) both large rigid and non-rigid motion, and 2) wide variations in image appearance. We then evaluated the trained model, without retraining, on MedMNIST, lung CT, and BraTS datasets. Results show that UniMo surpassed existing motion correction methods in accuracy, and notably enabled one-time training on a single modality while maintaining high stability and adaptability across unseen datasets. By offering a unified solution to motion correction, UniMo marks a significant advance in medical imaging, especially in applications with combined bulk and local motion.

Abstract: We present a modular robotic system for autonomous exploration and semantic updating of large-scale unknown environments. Our approach enables a mobile robot to build, revisit, and update a hybrid semantic map that integrates a 2D occupancy grid for geometry with a topological graph for object semantics. Unlike prior methods that rely on manual teleoperation or precollected datasets, our two-phase approach achieves end-to-end autonomy: first, a modified frontier-based exploration algorithm with dynamic search windows constructs a geometric map; second, using a greedy trajectory planner, environments are revisited, and object semantics are updated using open-vocabulary object detection and segmentation. This modular system, compatible with any metric SLAM framework, supports continuous operation by efficiently updating the semantic graph to reflect short-term and long-term changes such as object relocation, removal, or addition. We validate the approach on a Fetch robot in real-world indoor environments of approximately $8,500$m$^2$ and $117$m$^2$, demonstrating robust and scalable semantic mapping and continuous adaptation, marking a fully autonomous integration of exploration, mapping, and semantic updating on a physical robot.

Abstract: In medical image synthesis, the precision of localized structural details is crucial, particularly when addressing specific clinical requirements such as the identification and measurement of fine structures. Traditional methods for image translation and synthesis are generally optimized for global image reconstruction but often fall short in providing the finesse required for detailed local analysis. This study represents a step toward addressing this challenge by introducing a novel anatomical feature-prioritized (AFP) loss function into the synthesis process. This method enhances reconstruction by focusing on clinically significant structures, utilizing features from a pre-trained model designed for a specific downstream task, such as the segmentation of particular anatomical regions. The AFP loss function can replace or complement global reconstruction methods, ensuring a balanced emphasis on both global image fidelity and local structural details. Various implementations of this loss function are explored, including its integration into different synthesis networks such as GAN-based and CNN-based models. Our approach is applied and evaluated in two contexts: lung MR to CT translation, focusing on high-quality reconstruction of bronchial structures, using a private dataset; and pelvis MR to CT synthesis, targeting the accurate representation of organs and muscles, utilizing a public dataset from the Synthrad2023 challenge. We leverage embeddings from pre-trained segmentation models specific to these anatomical regions to demonstrate the capability of the AFP loss to prioritize and accurately reconstruct essential features. This tailored approach shows promising potential for enhancing the specificity and practicality of medical image synthesis in clinical applications.

Abstract: As the potential for autonomous vehicles to be integrated on a large scale into modern traffic systems continues to grow, ensuring safe navigation in dynamic environments is crucial for smooth integration. To guarantee safety and prevent collisions, autonomous vehicles must be capable of accurately predicting the trajectories of surrounding traffic agents. Over the past decade, significant efforts from both academia and industry have been dedicated to designing solutions for precise trajectory forecasting. These efforts have produced a diverse range of approaches, raising questions about the differences between these methods and whether trajectory prediction challenges have been fully addressed. This paper reviews a substantial portion of recent trajectory prediction methods proposing a taxonomy to classify existing solutions. A general overview of the prediction pipeline is also provided, covering input and output modalities, modeling features, and prediction paradigms existing in the literature. In addition, the paper discusses active research areas within trajectory prediction, addresses the posed research questions, and highlights the remaining research gaps and challenges.

Abstract: Structural changes in main retinal blood vessels serve as critical biomarkers for the onset and progression of glaucoma. Identifying these vessels is vital for vascular modeling yet highly challenging. This paper proposes X-GAN, a generative AI-powered unsupervised segmentation model designed for extracting main blood vessels from Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images. The process begins with the Space Colonization Algorithm (SCA) to rapidly generate a skeleton of vessels, featuring their radii. By synergistically integrating the generative adversarial network (GAN) with biostatistical modeling of vessel radii, X-GAN enables a fast reconstruction of both 2D and 3D representations of the vessels. Based on this reconstruction, X-GAN achieves nearly 100\% segmentation accuracy without relying on labeled data or high-performance computing resources. Experimental results confirm X-GAN's superiority in evaluating main vessel segmentation compared to existing deep learning models.

Abstract: Generating 3D scenes is still a challenging task due to the lack of readily available scene data. Most existing methods only produce partial scenes and provide limited navigational freedom. We introduce a practical and scalable solution that uses 360{\deg} video as an intermediate scene representation, capturing the full-scene context and ensuring consistent visual content throughout the generation. We propose WorldPrompter, a generative pipeline that synthesizes traversable 3D scenes from text prompts. WorldPrompter incorporates a conditional 360{\deg} panoramic video generator, capable of producing a 128-frame video that simulates a person walking through and capturing a virtual environment. The resulting video is then reconstructed as Gaussian splats by a fast feedforward 3D reconstructor, enabling a true walkable experience within the 3D scene. Experiments demonstrate that our panoramic video generation model, trained with a mix of image and video data, achieves convincing spatial and temporal consistency for static scenes. This is validated by an average COLMAP matching rate of 94.6\%, allowing for high-quality panoramic Gaussian splat reconstruction and improved navigation throughout the scene. Qualitative and quantitative results also show it outperforms the state-of-the-art 360{\deg} video generators and 3D scene generation models.

Abstract: Speech-driven talking head synthesis tasks commonly use general acoustic features as guided speech features. However, we discovered that these features suffer from phoneme-viseme alignment ambiguity, which refers to the uncertainty and imprecision in matching phonemes with visemes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a phoneme-aware speech encoder (PASE) that explicitly enforces accurate phoneme-viseme correspondence. PASE first captures fine-grained speech and visual features, then introduces a prediction-reconstruction task to improve robustness under noise and modality absence. Furthermore, a phoneme-level alignment module guided by phoneme embeddings and contrastive learning ensures discriminative audio and visual alignment. Experimental results show that PASE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both NeRF and 3DGS rendering models. Its lip sync accuracy improves by 13.7% and 14.2% compared to the acoustic feature, producing results close to the ground truth videos.

Abstract: Neural networks have become the backbone of modern AI, yet designing, evaluating, and comparing them remains labor-intensive. While many datasets exist for training models, there are few standardized collections of the models themselves. We present LEMUR, an open-source dataset and framework that brings together a large collection of PyTorch-based neural networks across tasks such as classification, segmentation, detection, and natural language processing. Each model follows a common template, with configurations and results logged in a structured database to ensure consistency and reproducibility. LEMUR integrates Optuna for automated hyperparameter optimization, provides statistical analysis and visualization tools, and exposes an API for seamless access to performance data. The framework also supports extensibility, enabling researchers to add new models, datasets, or metrics without breaking compatibility. By standardizing implementations and unifying evaluation, LEMUR aims to accelerate AutoML research, facilitate fair benchmarking, and lower the barrier to large-scale neural network experimentation.

Abstract: Mimicry is a fundamental learning mechanism in humans, enabling individuals to learn new tasks by observing and imitating experts. However, applying this ability to robots presents significant challenges due to the inherent differences between human and robot embodiments in both their visual appearance and physical capabilities. While previous methods bridge this gap using cross-embodiment datasets with shared scenes and tasks, collecting such aligned data between humans and robots at scale is not trivial. In this paper, we propose UniSkill, a novel framework that learns embodiment-agnostic skill representations from large-scale cross-embodiment video data without any labels, enabling skills extracted from human video prompts to effectively transfer to robot policies trained only on robot data. Our experiments in both simulation and real-world environments show that our cross-embodiment skills successfully guide robots in selecting appropriate actions, even with unseen video prompts.

Abstract: Real world data often exhibits unknown, instance-specific symmetries that rarely exactly match a transformation group $G$ fixed a priori. Class-pose decompositions aim to create disentangled representations by factoring inputs into invariant features and a pose $g\in G$ defined relative to a training-dependent, arbitrary canonical representation. We introduce RECON, a class-pose agnostic $\textit{canonical orientation normalization}$ that corrects arbitrary canonicals via a simple right-multiplication, yielding $\textit{natural}$, data-aligned canonicalizations. This enables (i) unsupervised discovery of instance-specific symmetry distributions, (ii) detection of out-of-distribution poses, and (iii) test-time canonicalization, granting group invariance to pre-trained models without retraining and irrespective of model architecture, improving downstream performance. We demonstrate results on 2D image benchmarks and --for the first time-- extend symmetry discovery to 3D groups.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce EmoGist, a training-free, in-context learning method for performing visual emotion classification with LVLMs. The key intuition of our approach is that context-dependent definition of emotion labels could allow more accurate predictions of emotions, as the ways in which emotions manifest within images are highly context dependent and nuanced. EmoGist pre-generates multiple descriptions of emotion labels, by analyzing the clusters of example images belonging to each label. At test time, we retrieve a version of description based on the cosine similarity of test image to cluster centroids, and feed it together with the test image to a fast LVLM for classification. Through our experiments, we show that EmoGist allows up to 12 points improvement in micro F1 scores with the multi-label Memotion dataset, and up to 8 points in macro F1 in the multi-class FI dataset.

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a key mechanism for harnessing the capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, its effectiveness remains highly sensitive to the quality of input ICL sequences, particularly for tasks involving complex reasoning or open-ended generation. A major limitation is our limited understanding of how LVLMs actually exploit these sequences during inference. To bridge this gap, we systematically interpret multimodal ICL through the lens of task mapping, which reveals how local and global relationships within and among demonstrations guide model reasoning. Building on this insight, we present TACO, a lightweight transformer-based model equipped with task-aware attention that dynamically configures ICL sequences. By injecting task-mapping signals into the autoregressive decoding process, TACO creates a bidirectional synergy between sequence construction and task reasoning. Experiments on five LVLMs and nine datasets demonstrate that TACO consistently surpasses baselines across diverse ICL tasks. These results position task mapping as a novel and valuable perspective for interpreting and improving multimodal ICL.

Abstract: This paper introduces QA-HFL, a quality-aware hierarchical federated learning framework that efficiently handles heterogeneous image quality across resource-constrained mobile devices. Our approach trains specialized local models for different image quality levels and aggregates their features using a quality-weighted fusion mechanism, while incorporating differential privacy protection. Experiments on MNIST demonstrate that QA-HFL achieves 92.31% accuracy after just three federation rounds, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods like FedRolex (86.42%). Under strict privacy constraints, our approach maintains 30.77% accuracy with formal differential privacy guarantees. Counter-intuitively, low-end devices contributed most significantly (63.5%) to the final model despite using 100 fewer parameters than high-end counterparts. Our quality-aware approach addresses accuracy decline through device-specific regularization, adaptive weighting, intelligent client selection, and server-side knowledge distillation, while maintaining efficient communication with a 4.71% compression ratio. Statistical analysis confirms that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods (p 0.01) under both standard and privacy-constrained conditions.

<title>Single-step Diffusion for Image Compression at Ultra-Low Bitrates</title>

Abstract: Although there have been significant advancements in image compression techniques, such as standard and learned codecs, these methods still suffer from severe quality degradation at extremely low bits per pixel. While recent diffusion-based models provided enhanced generative performance at low bitrates, they often yields limited perceptual quality and prohibitive decoding latency due to multiple denoising steps. In this paper, we propose the single-step diffusion model for image compression that delivers high perceptual quality and fast decoding at ultra-low bitrates. Our approach incorporates two key innovations: (i) Vector-Quantized Residual (VQ-Residual) training, which factorizes a structural base code and a learned residual in latent space, capturing both global geometry and high-frequency details; and (ii) rate-aware noise modulation, which tunes denoising strength to match the desired bitrate. Extensive experiments show that ours achieves comparable compression performance to state-of-the-art methods while improving decoding speed by about 50x compared to prior diffusion-based methods, greatly enhancing the practicality of generative codecs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a promising way to automate Radiology Report Generation (RRG). In this work, we systematically investigate the design space of 3D MLLMs, including visual input representation, projectors, Large Language Models (LLMs), and fine-tuning techniques for 3D CT report generation. We also introduce two knowledge-based report augmentation methods that improve performance on the GREEN score by up to 10%, achieving the 2nd place on the MICCAI 2024 AMOS-MM challenge. Our results on the 1,687 cases from the AMOS-MM dataset show that RRG is largely independent of the size of LLM under the same training protocol. We also show that larger volume size does not always improve performance if the original ViT was pre-trained on a smaller volume size. Lastly, we show that using a segmentation mask along with the CT volume improves performance. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/bowang-lab/AMOS-MM-Solution

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising framework for enabling generalist robots capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in the real world. These models usually build upon pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which excel at semantic understanding due to large-scale image and text pretraining. However, existing VLMs typically lack precise spatial understanding capabilities, as they are primarily tuned on 2D image-text pairs without 3D supervision. To address this limitation, recent approaches have incorporated explicit 3D inputs such as point clouds or depth maps, but this necessitates additional depth sensors or pre-trained depth estimation models, which may yield defective results. In contrast, our work introduces a plug-and-play module that implicitly incorporates 3D geometry features into VLA models by leveraging an off-the-shelf visual geometry foundation model. This integration provides the model with depth-aware visual representations, improving its ability to understand the geometric structure of the scene and the spatial relationships among objects from RGB images alone. We evaluate our method on a set of spatially challenging tasks in both simulation and the real world. Extensive evaluations show that our method significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art VLA models across diverse scenarios.

Abstract: Robots must integrate multiple sensory modalities to act effectively in the real world. Yet, learning such multimodal policies at scale remains challenging. Simulation offers a viable solution, but while vision has benefited from high-fidelity simulators, other modalities (e.g. sound) can be notoriously difficult to simulate. As a result, sim-to-real transfer has succeeded primarily in vision-based tasks, with multimodal transfer still largely unrealized. In this work, we tackle these challenges by introducing MultiGen, a framework that integrates large-scale generative models into traditional physics simulators, enabling multisensory simulation. We showcase our framework on the dynamic task of robot pouring, which inherently relies on multimodal feedback. By synthesizing realistic audio conditioned on simulation video, our method enables training on rich audiovisual trajectories -- without any real robot data. We demonstrate effective zero-shot transfer to real-world pouring with novel containers and liquids, highlighting the potential of generative modeling to both simulate hard-to-model modalities and close the multimodal sim-to-real gap.

Abstract: Map applications are still largely point-and-click, making it difficult to ask map-centric questions or connect what a camera sees to the surrounding geospatial context with view-conditioned inputs. We introduce IMAIA, an interactive Maps AI Assistant that enables natural-language interaction with both vector (street) maps and satellite imagery, and augments camera inputs with geospatial intelligence to help users understand the world. IMAIA comprises two complementary components. Maps Plus treats the map as first-class context by parsing tiled vector/satellite views into a grid-aligned representation that a language model can query to resolve deictic references (e.g., ``the flower-shaped building next to the park in the top-right''). Places AI Smart Assistant (PAISA) performs camera-aware place understanding by fusing image--place embeddings with geospatial signals (location, heading, proximity) to ground a scene, surface salient attributes, and generate concise explanations. A lightweight multi-agent design keeps latency low and exposes interpretable intermediate decisions. Across map-centric QA and camera-to-place grounding tasks, IMAIA improves accuracy and responsiveness over strong baselines while remaining practical for user-facing deployments. By unifying language, maps, and geospatial cues, IMAIA moves beyond scripted tools toward conversational mapping that is both spatially grounded and broadly usable.

Abstract: Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs attention to task-relevant regions through foveation, dramatically reducing visual processing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive, uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance efficiency and robustness. We develop GIAVA (Gaze Integrated Active-Vision ALOHA), a robot vision system that emulates human head and neck movement, and gaze adjustment for foveated processing. Extending the AV-ALOHA robot platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously collecting eye-tracking, perspective control, and robot manipulation demonstration data from a human operator. We also open-source a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that incorporate human gaze. Inspired by recent work in foveated image segmentation and given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated patch tokenization scheme. Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number of tokens, and thus computation. Our results show that our method for foveated robot vision drastically reduces computational overhead, and enhances robustness to background distractors. Notably, on certain high-precision tasks, foveated vision also improves performance, as reflected in higher success rates. Together, these findings suggest that human-inspired foveated visual processing offers untapped potential and should be further considered as a useful inductive bias in robotic vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/

Abstract: Since any ReLU network is piecewise affine, its hidden units can be characterized by their pullbacks through the active subnetwork, i.e., by their gradients (up to bias terms). However, gradients of deeper neurons are notoriously misaligned, which obscures the network's internal representations. We posit that models do align gradients with data, yet this is concealed by the intrinsic noise of the ReLU hard gating. We validate this intuition by applying soft gating in the backward pass only, reducing the local impact of weakly excited neurons. The resulting modified gradients, which we call "excitation pullbacks", exhibit striking perceptual alignment on a number of ImageNet-pretrained architectures, while the rudimentary pixel-space gradient ascent quickly produces easily interpretable input- and target-specific features. Inspired by these findings, we formulate the "path stability" hypothesis, claiming that the binary activation patterns largely stabilize during training and get encoded in the pre-activation distribution of the final model. When true, excitation pullbacks become aligned with the gradients of a kernel machine that mainly determines the network's decision. This provides a theoretical justification for the apparent faithfulness of the feature attributions based on excitation pullbacks, potentially even leading to mechanistic interpretability of deep models. Incidentally, we give a possible explanation for the effectiveness of Batch Normalization and Deep Features, together with a novel perspective on the network's internal memory and generalization properties. We release the code and an interactive app for easier exploration of the excitation pullbacks.

<title>Side Effects of Erasing Concepts from Diffusion Models</title>

arXiv:2508.15124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy, copyright, and safety have led to the development of concept erasure techniques (CETs). The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired "target" concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to synthesize high-quality images of other concepts. In this work, we demonstrate that concept erasure has side effects and CETs can be easily circumvented. For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present the Side Effect Evaluation (SEE) benchmark that consists of hierarchical and compositional prompts describing objects and their attributes. The dataset and an automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets, and attribute leakage. Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using superclass-subclass hierarchy, semantically similar prompts, and compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute leakage and a counterintuitive phenomenon of attention concentration or dispersal. We release our benchmark and evaluation tools to aid future work on robust concept erasure.

arXiv:2508.16024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of wavelet-space feature decomposition in neural super-resolution for rendering pipelines. Building on recent neural upscaling frameworks, we introduce a formulation that predicts stationary wavelet coefficients rather than directly regressing RGB values. This frequency-aware decomposition separates low- and high-frequency components, enabling sharper texture recovery and reducing blur in challenging regions. Unlike conventional wavelet transforms, our use of the stationary wavelet transform (SWT) preserves spatial alignment across subbands, allowing the network to integrate G-buffer attributes and temporally warped history frames in a shift-invariant manner. The predicted coefficients are recombined through inverse wavelet synthesis, producing resolution-consistent reconstructions across arbitrary scale factors. We conduct extensive evaluations and ablations, showing that incorporating SWT improves both fidelity and perceptual quality with only modest overhead, while remaining compatible with standard rendering architectures. Taken together, our results suggest that wavelet-domain neural super-resolution provides a principled and efficient path toward higher-quality real-time rendering, with broader implications for neural rendering and graphics applications.

Abstract: Brain atlases are essential for reducing the dimensionality of neuroimaging data and enabling interpretable analysis. However, most existing atlases are predefined, group-level templates with limited flexibility and resolution. We present Deep Cluster Atlas (DCA), a graph-guided deep embedding clustering framework for generating individualized, voxel-wise brain parcellations. DCA combines a pretrained autoencoder with spatially regularized deep clustering to produce functionally coherent and spatially contiguous regions. Our method supports flexible control over resolution and anatomical scope, and generalizes to arbitrary brain structures. We further introduce a standardized benchmarking platform for atlas evaluation, using multiple large-scale fMRI datasets. Across multiple datasets and scales, DCA outperforms state-of-the-art atlases, improving functional homogeneity by 98.8% and silhouette coefficient by 29%, and achieves superior performance in downstream tasks such as autism diagnosis and cognitive decoding. We also observe that a fine-tuned pretrained model achieves superior results on the corresponding task. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/ncclab-sustech/DCA .

Abstract: The reliable identification of mitotic figures in whole-slide histopathological images remains difficult, owing to their low prevalence, substantial morphological heterogeneity, and the inconsistencies introduced by tissue processing and staining procedures. The MIDOG competition series provides standardized benchmarks for evaluating detection approaches across diverse domains, thus motivating the development of generalizable deep learning models. In this work, we investigate the performance of two modern one-stage detectors, YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, trained on MIDOG++, CMC, and CCMCT datasets. To enhance robustness, training incorporated stain-invariant color perturbations and texture-preserving augmentations. Ininternal validation, YOLOv5 achieved higher precision (84.3%), while YOLOv8 offered improved recall (82.6%), reflecting architectural trade-offs between anchor-based and anchor-free detections. To capitalize on their complementary strengths, weemployed an ensemble of the two models, which improved sensitivity (85.3%) while maintaining competitive precision, yielding the best F1 score of 83.1%. On the preliminary MIDOG 2025 test leaderboard, our ensemble ranked 5th with an F1 score of 79.2%, precision of 73.6%, and recall of 85.8%, confirming that the proposed strategy generalizes effectively across unseen test data. These findings highlight the effectiveness of combining anchor-based and anchor-free object detectors to advance automated mitosis detection in digital pathology.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of images produced by electronic displays is critical for the evaluation of both traditional and computational displays. Traditional display measurement methods based on sparse radiometric sampling and fitting a model are inadequate for capturing spatially varying display artifacts, as they fail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions. While cameras offer sufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and photometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined with a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to be visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a combination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference predictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and visual difference prediction. The reconstruction pipeline combines HDR image stacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion, homography transformation, and color correction, enabling cameras to function as precise display measurement instruments. By incorporating a Visual Difference Predictor (VDP), our system models the visibility of various stimuli under different viewing conditions for the human visual system. We validate the proposed CameraVDP framework through three applications: defective pixel detection, color fringing awareness, and display non-uniformity evaluation. Our uncertainty analysis framework enables the estimation of the theoretical upper bound for defect pixel detection performance and provides confidence intervals for VDP quality scores.

Abstract: Remote sensing is critical for disaster monitoring, yet existing datasets lack temporal image pairs and detailed textual annotations. While single-snapshot imagery dominates current resources, it fails to capture dynamic disaster impacts over time. To address this gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Change Caption (RSCC) dataset, a large-scale benchmark comprising 62,315 pre-/post-disaster image pairs (spanning earthquakes, floods, wildfires, and more) paired with rich, human-like change captions. By bridging the temporal and semantic divide in remote sensing data, RSCC enables robust training and evaluation of vision-language models for disaster-aware bi-temporal understanding. Our results highlight RSCC's ability to facilitate detailed disaster-related analysis, paving the way for more accurate, interpretable, and scalable vision-language applications in remote sensing.

arXiv:2509.15234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language pretraining has advanced image-text alignment, yet progress in radiology remains constrained by the heterogeneity of clinical reports, including abbreviations, impression-only notes, and stylistic variability. Unlike general-domain settings where more data often leads to better performance, naively scaling to large collections of noisy reports can plateau or even degrade model learning. We ask whether large language model (LLM) encoders can provide robust clinical representations that transfer across diverse styles and better guide image-text alignment. We introduce LLM2VEC4CXR, a domain-adapted LLM encoder for chest X-ray reports, and LLM2CLIP4CXR, a dual-tower framework that couples this encoder with a vision backbone. LLM2VEC4CXR improves clinical text understanding over BERT-based baselines, handles abbreviations and style variation, and achieves strong clinical alignment on report-level metrics. LLM2CLIP4CXR leverages these embeddings to boost retrieval accuracy and clinically oriented scores, with stronger cross-dataset generalization than prior medical CLIP variants. Trained on 1.6M CXR studies from public and private sources with heterogeneous and noisy reports, our models demonstrate that robustness -- not scale alone -- is the key to effective multimodal learning. We release models to support further research in medical image-text representation learning.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces ViSpec, a framework designed for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to accelerate inference by effectively filtering redundant image information without compromising textual comprehension. ViSpec utilizes a vision adaptor module to compress image tokens and integrate them into the model's attention mechanism. Global feature vectors are extracted from input images to enhance multimodal coherence. A specialized training dataset is curated to prevent shortcut learning and ensure robust performance. Through extensive experiments, ViSpec achieves significant speedups in VLM speculative decoding, marking a notable advancement in this field. <div>

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest speedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM speculative decoding.

- Human-annotated benchmark with augmented samples for real-world conditions.
- M-PACE employs a mother-child MLLM setup to automate quality control and reduce dependence on human reviewers.

arXiv:2509.15241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring that multi-modal content adheres to brand, legal, or platform-specific compliance standards is an increasingly complex challenge across domains. Traditional compliance frameworks typically rely on disjointed, multi-stage pipelines that integrate separate modules for image classification, text extraction, audio transcription, hand-crafted checks, and rule-based merges. This architectural fragmentation increases operational overhead, hampers scalability, and hinders the ability to adapt to dynamic guidelines efficiently. With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), there is growing potential to unify these workflows under a single, general-purpose framework capable of jointly processing visual and textual content. In light of this, we propose Multimodal Parameter Agnostic Compliance Engine (M-PACE), a framework designed for assessing attributes across vision-language inputs in a single pass. As a representative use case, we apply M-PACE to advertisement compliance, demonstrating its ability to evaluate over 15 compliance-related attributes. To support structured evaluation, we introduce a human-annotated benchmark enriched with augmented samples that simulate challenging real-world conditions, including visual obstructions and profanity injection. M-PACE employs a mother-child MLLM setup, demonstrating that a stronger parent MLLM evaluating the outputs of smaller child models can significantly reduce dependence on human reviewers, thereby automating quality control. Our analysis reveals that inference costs reduce by over 31 times, with the most efficient models (Gemini 2.0 Flash as child MLLM selected by mother MLLM) operating at 0.0005 per image, compared to 0.0159 for Gemini 2.5 Pro with comparable accuracy, highlighting the trade-off between cost and output quality achieved in real time by M-PACE in real life deployment over advertising data.

Summary:
ProFusion is a hybrid framework that combines deep learning with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to improve protein structure prediction for large protein complexes. By integrating a deep learning model with AFM, ProFusion utilizes high-resolution height maps from random orientations to generate multi-view data for 3D reconstruction. To overcome the challenge of generating a large-scale AFM imaging dataset, a virtual AFM framework was developed to simulate the imaging process and create a dataset of synthetic AFM images. Using a conditional diffusion model and a Neural Radiance Field model, ProFusion is able to synthesize novel views and reconstruct 3D protein structures with high fidelity. Experimental validation on various protein complexes demonstrates the potential of ProFusion for accurate and cost-effective protein complex structure prediction, as well as rapid iterative validation using AFM experiments.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: AI-based in silico methods have improved protein structure prediction but often struggle with large protein complexes (PCs) involving multiple interacting proteins due to missing 3D spatial cues. Experimental techniques like Cryo-EM are accurate but costly and time-consuming. We present ProFusion, a hybrid framework that integrates a deep learning model with Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), which provides high-resolution height maps from random orientations, naturally yielding multi-view data for 3D reconstruction. However, generating a large-scale AFM imaging data set sufficient to train deep learning models is impractical. Therefore, we developed a virtual AFM framework that simulates the imaging process and generated a dataset of ~542,000 proteins with multi-view synthetic AFM images. We train a conditional diffusion model to synthesize novel views from unposed inputs and an instance-specific Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) model to reconstruct 3D structures. Our reconstructed 3D protein structures achieve an average Chamfer Distance within the AFM imaging resolution, reflecting high structural fidelity. Our method is extensively validated on experimental AFM images of various PCs, demonstrating strong potential for accurate, cost-effective protein complex structure prediction and rapid iterative validation using AFM experiments.

Summary:
The paper introduces the Multi-Modal Explainable Learning (MMEL) framework to enhance the interpretability of vision-language models while maintaining high performance. MMEL incorporates a Hierarchical Semantic Relationship Module that processes features at multiple semantic levels, capturing relationships between image regions with adaptive attention weighting and cross-modal alignment. By applying layer-specific weights, MMEL produces more comprehensive visual explanations highlighting primary objects and their contextual relationships. Through experiments on standard datasets, MMEL demonstrates improved precision in visualizations that reflect how vision-language models process complex scenes. This framework is suitable for safety-critical contexts requiring high interpretability and reliability, offering valuable insights into model decisions across various domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have significantly expanded the frontiers of automated image analysis. However, applying these models in safety-critical contexts remains challenging due to the complex relationships between objects, subtle visual cues, and the heightened demand for transparency and reliability. This paper presents the Multi-Modal Explainable Learning (MMEL) framework, designed to enhance the interpretability of vision-language models while maintaining high performance. Building upon prior work in gradient-based explanations for transformer architectures (Grad-eclip), MMEL introduces a novel Hierarchical Semantic Relationship Module that enhances model interpretability through multi-scale feature processing, adaptive attention weighting, and cross-modal alignment. Our approach processes features at multiple semantic levels to capture relationships between image regions at different granularities, applying learnable layer-specific weights to balance contributions across the model's depth. This results in more comprehensive visual explanations that highlight both primary objects and their contextual relationships with improved precision. Through extensive experiments on standard datasets, we demonstrate that by incorporating semantic relationship information into gradient-based attribution maps, MMEL produces more focused and contextually aware visualizations that better reflect how vision-language models process complex scenes. The MMEL framework generalizes across various domains, offering valuable insights into model decisions for applications requiring high interpretability and reliability.

<div> Keywords: Vision-and-Language Navigation, Token pruning, Navigation-Aware Pruning, Efficiency, FLOPS <br />
Summary: 
Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP) introduces a method for optimizing the efficiency of large models in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks. By pre-filtering tokens into foreground and background based on navigation-specific traits, NAP simplifies the pruning process and minimizes information loss. By focusing on pruning background tokens and discouraging backtracking, NAP successfully preserves higher success rates while saving over 50% FLOPS. This approach addresses the challenge of increasing computational cost due to longer walks, which can result from information loss in pruning. Experimental results on standard VLN benchmarks demonstrate that NAP outperforms previous methods in both efficiency and performance, making it a promising solution for resource-limited environments. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.15250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large models achieve strong performance on Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks, but are costly to run in resource-limited environments. Token pruning offers appealing tradeoffs for efficiency with minimal performance loss by reducing model input size, but prior work overlooks VLN-specific challenges. For example, information loss from pruning can effectively increase computational cost due to longer walks. Thus, the inability to identify uninformative tokens undermines the supposed efficiency gains from pruning. To address this, we propose Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), which uses navigation-specific traits to simplify the pruning process by pre-filtering tokens into foreground and background. For example, image views are filtered based on whether the agent can navigate in that direction. We also extract navigation-relevant instructions using a Large Language Model. After filtering, we focus pruning on background tokens, minimizing information loss. To further help avoid increases in navigation length, we discourage backtracking by removing low-importance navigation nodes. Experiments on standard VLN benchmarks show NAP significantly outperforms prior work, preserving higher success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enabled high-fidelity and semantically rich text-to-image generation; however, ensuring fairness and safety remains an open challenge. Existing methods typically improve fairness and safety at the expense of semantic fidelity and image quality. In this work, we propose RespoDiff, a novel framework for responsible text-to-image generation that incorporates a dual-module transformation on the intermediate bottleneck representations of diffusion models. Our approach introduces two distinct learnable modules: one focused on capturing and enforcing responsible concepts, such as fairness and safety, and the other dedicated to maintaining semantic alignment with neutral prompts. To facilitate the dual learning process, we introduce a novel score-matching objective that enables effective coordination between the modules. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity. Our approach improves responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across diverse, unseen prompts. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into large-scale models like SDXL, enhancing fairness and safety. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Summary: <br />
This study explores the use of autoguidance and online data selection methods to enhance the efficiency of training generative diffusion models. The researchers developed a unified framework integrating joint example selection and autoguidance for quick evaluation. Testing on synthetic and image generation tasks revealed that autoguidance consistently enhances sample quality and diversity. Early application of joint example selection at the beginning of training can match or slightly surpass autoguidance in data efficiency, but its time overhead and complexity make autoguidance or random data selection more favorable. The study suggests that targeted online selection can improve efficiency in initial training stages, but long-term sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. The findings highlight the potential benefits of data selection in certain scenarios and emphasize the importance of autoguidance for robust sample quality enhancement. <div>
arXiv:2509.15267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The costs of generative model compute rekindled promises and hopes for efficient data curation. In this work, we investigate whether recently developed autoguidance and online data selection methods can improve the time and sample efficiency of training generative diffusion models. We integrate joint example selection (JEST) and autoguidance into a unified code base for fast ablation and benchmarking. We evaluate combinations of data curation on a controlled 2-D synthetic data generation task as well as (3x64x64)-D image generation. Our comparisons are made at equal wall-clock time and equal number of samples, explicitly accounting for the overhead of selection. Across experiments, autoguidance consistently improves sample quality and diversity. Early AJEST (applying selection only at the beginning of training) can match or modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency on both tasks. However, its time overhead and added complexity make autoguidance or uniform random data selection preferable in most situations. These findings suggest that while targeted online selection can yield efficiency gains in early training, robust sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. We discuss limitations and scope, and outline when data selection may be beneficial.

Summary:
The article introduces PRISM, a Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image Signature Mapping framework designed for fingerprinting AI-generated images to identify their original model. Utilizing a radial reduction of the discrete Fourier transform, PRISM captures model-specific signatures through amplitude and phase information for reliable model attribution. The authors constructed a dataset, PRISM-36K, comprising 36,000 images generated by various models, achieving an attribution accuracy of 92.04%. Evaluation on four benchmarks yielded an average accuracy of 81.60%. PRISM also successfully detected real vs. fake images with an average accuracy of 88.41%, outperforming existing benchmarks. Notably, on the GenImage benchmark, PRISM achieved an accuracy of 95.06% compared to 82.20% originally. The results highlight the efficacy of frequency-domain fingerprinting for model attribution across architectures and datasets, offering a robust solution for ensuring accountability and trust in generative AI systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: A critical need has emerged for generative AI: attribution methods. That is, solutions that can identify the model originating AI-generated content. This feature, generally relevant in multimodal applications, is especially sensitive in commercial settings where users subscribe to paid proprietary services and expect guarantees about the source of the content they receive. To address these issues, we introduce PRISM, a scalable Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images. PRISM is based on a radial reduction of the discrete Fourier transform that leverages amplitude and phase information to capture model-specific signatures. The output of the above process is subsequently clustered via linear discriminant analysis to achieve reliable model attribution in diverse settings, even if the model's internal details are inaccessible. To support our work, we construct PRISM-36K, a novel dataset of 36,000 images generated by six text-to-image GAN- and diffusion-based models. On this dataset, PRISM achieves an attribution accuracy of 92.04%. We additionally evaluate our method on four benchmarks from the literature, reaching an average accuracy of 81.60%. Finally, we evaluate our methodology also in the binary task of detecting real vs fake images, achieving an average accuracy of 88.41%. We obtain our best result on GenImage with an accuracy of 95.06%, whereas the original benchmark achieved 82.20%. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency-domain fingerprinting for cross-architecture and cross-dataset model attribution, offering a viable solution for enforcing accountability and trust in generative AI systems.

Abstract: Mental rotation is a key test of spatial reasoning in humans and has been central to understanding how perception supports cognition. Despite the success of modern vision transformers, it is still unclear how well these models develop similar abilities. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, and DINOv3 across a range of mental-rotation tasks, from simple block structures similar to those used by Shepard and Metzler to study human cognition, to more complex block figures, three types of text, and photo-realistic objects. By probing model representations layer by layer, we examine where and how these networks succeed. We find that i) self-supervised ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised ViTs; ii) intermediate layers perform better than final layers; iii) task difficulty increases with rotation complexity and occlusion, mirroring human reaction times and suggesting similar constraints in embedding space representations.

Summary: <br />
Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) has shown promise for various computer vision tasks, utilizing Contrastive Learning and Masked Image Modeling as pre-training objectives. ViT features from the final attention block and feed-forward layer are commonly used for downstream tasks, but further transformations are often applied for improved performance. This study evaluates the capabilities of unaltered ViT features across image classification and segmentation tasks, without additional processing. The analysis considers token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models, focusing on hyperplane and cosine-similarity based rules. Insights are provided on optimal token type and decision rule selection based on task and context, presenting detailed results on popular datasets. <div>
arXiv:2509.15272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) has recently demonstrated considerable potential as a pre-training strategy for a variety of computer vision tasks, including image classification and segmentation, both in standard and few-shot downstream contexts. Two pre-training objectives dominate the landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image Modeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention block -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features obtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common foundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing approaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through additional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined with distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods can improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive analysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features has yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically evaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and segmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts. The classification and segmentation rules that we use are either hyperplane based (as in logistic regression) or cosine-similarity based, both of which rely on the presence of interpretable directions in the ViT's latent space. Based on the previous rules and without the use of additional feature transformations, we conduct an analysis across token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models. This study provides insights into the optimal choice for token type and decision rule based on the task, context, and the pre-training objective, while reporting detailed findings on two widely-used datasets.

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in the physical world must make decisions that are not only effective but also safe, spatially coherent, and grounded in context. While recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown promising capabilities in visual understanding and language generation, their ability to perform structured reasoning for real-world embodied tasks remains underexplored. In this work, we aim to understand how well foundation models can perform step-by-step reasoning in embodied environments. To this end, we propose the Foundation Model Embodied Reasoning (FoMER) benchmark, designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LMMs in complex embodied decision-making scenarios. Our benchmark spans a diverse set of tasks that require agents to interpret multimodal observations, reason about physical constraints and safety, and generate valid next actions in natural language. We present (i) a large-scale, curated suite of embodied reasoning tasks, (ii) a novel evaluation framework that disentangles perceptual grounding from action reasoning, and (iii) empirical analysis of several leading LMMs under this setting. Our benchmark includes over 1.1k samples with detailed step-by-step reasoning across 10 tasks and 8 embodiments, covering three different robot types. Our results highlight both the potential and current limitations of LMMs in embodied reasoning, pointing towards key challenges and opportunities for future research in robot intelligence.

Summary: This paper introduces a new method, Conditional Domain prompt Learning (CoDoL), to improve vision-language models' out-of-distribution generalization. Current prompt-based CLIP methods are hindered by inaccurate text descriptions and limited vision-language alignment, affecting performance and robustness. CoDoL leverages domain information to create prompts and enhance the alignment of vision and language embeddings, boosting generalization. Additionally, a Domain Meta Network (DMN) captures both instance-specific and domain-specific details by generating input-conditional tokens for images in each domain. Experimentation on various out-of-distribution benchmarks confirms CoDoL's efficacy in enhancing vision-language alignment and generalization across different domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-training vision-language models (VLMs), e.g., contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) methods, have shown great potential in learning out-of-distribution (OOD) representations. Despite showing competitive performance, the prompt-based CLIP methods still suffer from: i) inaccurate text descriptions, which leads to degraded accuracy and robustness, and poses a challenge for zero-shot CLIP methods. ii) limited vision-language embedding alignment, which significantly affects the generalization performance. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a novel Conditional Domain prompt Learning (CoDoL) method, which utilizes readily-available domain information to form prompts and improves the vision-language embedding alignment for improving OOD generalization. To capture both instance-specific and domain-specific information, we further propose a lightweight Domain Meta Network (DMN) to generate input-conditional tokens for images in each domain. Extensive experiments on four OOD benchmarks (PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome and DigitDG) validate the effectiveness of our proposed CoDoL in terms of improving the vision-language embedding alignment as well as the out-of-distribution generalization performance.

<div> Keywords: AdaptiveNN, active vision, sequential decision-making, reinforcement learning, interpretability

Summary: 
AdaptiveNN introduces a new framework for computer vision that mimics human vision by actively selecting task-relevant regions in a scene. By formulating visual perception as a sequential decision-making process, AdaptiveNN efficiently processes information and reduces inference cost by up to 28 times without sacrificing accuracy. The model combines representation learning with reinforcement learning to train end-to-end without supervision on fixation locations. It adapts to varying task demands and resource budgets, providing enhanced interpretability through fixation patterns. AdaptiveNN shows human-like perceptual behaviors, making it a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition. With applications across various tasks, including visual recognition, visual search, medical imaging, and language-driven AI, AdaptiveNN demonstrates promising advancements in efficient, flexible, and interpretable computer vision.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.15333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations, and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning, enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17 benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition, fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side comparisons with humans.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but their practical application is often hindered by the slow sampling speed. Prior efforts of improving efficiency primarily focus on compressing models or reducing the total number of denoising steps, largely neglecting the possibility to leverage multiple input resolutions in the generation process. In this work, we propose LowDiff, a novel and efficient diffusion framework based on a cascaded approach by generating increasingly higher resolution outputs. Besides, LowDiff employs a unified model to progressively refine images from low resolution to the desired resolution. With the proposed architecture design and generation techniques, we achieve comparable or even superior performance with much fewer high-resolution sampling steps. LowDiff is applicable to diffusion models in both pixel space and latent space. Extensive experiments on both conditional and unconditional generation tasks across CIFAR-10, FFHQ and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our method. Results show over 50% throughput improvement across all datasets and settings while maintaining comparable or better quality. On unconditional CIFAR-10, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.11 and IS of 9.87, while on conditional CIFAR-10, an FID of 1.94 and IS of 10.03. On FFHQ 64x64, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.43, and on ImageNet 256x256, LowDiff built on LightningDiT-B/1 produces high-quality samples with a FID of 4.00 and an IS of 195.06, together with substantial efficiency gains.

<div> maskAttn-SDXL, text-to-image diffusion models, compositional failures, cross-token interference, spatial compliance
Summary: 
maskAttn-SDXL is a new gating mechanism proposed for text-to-image diffusion models, specifically addressing compositional failures in multi-object prompts. By sparsifying token-to-latent interactions with binary masks at the logit level, the model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding without the need for additional positional encodings or external masks. The method enhances image quality while enforcing semantic connections for better control over object arrangement and spatial relations. maskAttn-SDXL demonstrates data-efficient enforcement of compositional control and offers a practical solution for enhancing spatial control in text-to-image generation. <div>
arXiv:2509.15357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive realism but often suffer from compositional failures on prompts with multiple objects, attributes, and spatial relations, resulting in cross-token interference where entities entangle, attributes mix across objects, and spatial cues are violated. To address these failures, we propose MaskAttn-SDXL,a region-level gating mechanism applied to the cross-attention logits of Stable Diffusion XL(SDXL)'s UNet. MaskAttn-SDXL learns a binary mask per layer, injecting it into each cross-attention logit map before softmax to sparsify token-to-latent interactions so that only semantically relevant connections remain active. The method requires no positional encodings, auxiliary tokens, or external region masks, and preserves the original inference path with negligible overhead. In practice, our model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity. These findings demonstrate that logit-level maksed cross-attention is an data-efficient primitve for enforcing compositional control, and our method thus serves as a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image generation.

Summary:
RaceGAN is a novel framework for multi-domain image-to-image translation that specifically focuses on translating racial traits without the need for a reference image. It outperforms existing models in translating racial features such as Asian, White, and Black on the Chicago Face Dataset. The framework is able to map style codes across different domains while preserving individuality and high-level semantics. The effectiveness of the racial translation is demonstrated through quantitative findings based on InceptionResNetv2-based classification. Additionally, RaceGAN successfully partitions the latent space into distinct clusters of faces for each ethnic group. This research represents a significant advancement in the field of image-to-image translation for racial attributes. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.15391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated significant progress in unpaired image-to-image translation in recent years for several applications. CycleGAN was the first to lead the way, although it was restricted to a pair of domains. StarGAN overcame this constraint by tackling image-to-image translation across various domains, although it was not able to map in-depth low-level style changes for these domains. Style mapping via reference-guided image synthesis has been made possible by the innovations of StarGANv2 and StyleGAN. However, these models do not maintain individuality and need an extra reference image in addition to the input. Our study aims to translate racial traits by means of multi-domain image-to-image translation. We present RaceGAN, a novel framework capable of mapping style codes over several domains during racial attribute translation while maintaining individuality and high level semantics without relying on a reference image. RaceGAN outperforms other models in translating racial features (i.e., Asian, White, and Black) when tested on Chicago Face Dataset. We also give quantitative findings utilizing InceptionReNetv2-based classification to demonstrate the effectiveness of our racial translation. Moreover, we investigate how well the model partitions the latent space into distinct clusters of faces for each ethnic group.

Summary:
This article introduces a novel approach for providing global symbolic explanations for deep learning models. Existing explanation methods tend to focus on localized visual explanations or require extensive annotations for concept-based explanations. The proposed approach leverages user-defined part labels from a limited set of images and transfers them efficiently to a larger dataset. By aggregating part-based local explanations, the method generates human-understandable explanations for model decisions on a large scale. This enables the extraction of global insights without incurring significant labeling costs. By combining local and global explanations, the approach offers a comprehensive understanding of the model's decision-making process, addressing the opacity inherent in deep learning models. Overall, this method provides a cost-effective and efficient way to make deep learning models more interpretable.

Abstract: Deep learning models are notoriously opaque. Existing explanation methods often focus on localized visual explanations for individual images. Concept-based explanations, while offering global insights, require extensive annotations, incurring significant labeling cost. We propose an approach that leverages user-defined part labels from a limited set of images and efficiently transfers them to a larger dataset. This enables the generation of global symbolic explanations by aggregating part-based local explanations, ultimately providing human-understandable explanations for model decisions on a large scale.

<div> fingerprint, generative models, causality, attribution, forgery detection

Summary:
This paper introduces the concept of causal fingerprints for AI generative models, aiming to capture the causality between image provenance and model traces. A causality-decoupling framework is proposed to disentangle fingerprints from image-specific content and style in a semantic-invariant latent space. The approach enhances fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations and validates causality through attribution performance across various GANs and diffusion models. The method outperforms existing techniques in model attribution, indicating potential for forgery detection, model copyright tracing, and identity protection. Source anonymization is achieved using counterfactual examples generated from causal fingerprints. This research highlights the importance of understanding the causal relationship between image origin and model signatures in developing effective methods for model attribution and protection. <div>
arXiv:2509.15406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI generative models leave implicit traces in their generated images, which are commonly referred to as model fingerprints and are exploited for source attribution. Prior methods rely on model-specific cues or synthesis artifacts, yielding limited fingerprints that may generalize poorly across different generative models. We argue that a complete model fingerprint should reflect the causality between image provenance and model traces, a direction largely unexplored. To this end, we conceptualize the \emph{causal fingerprint} of generative models, and propose a causality-decoupling framework that disentangles it from image-specific content and style in a semantic-invariant latent space derived from pre-trained diffusion reconstruction residual. We further enhance fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations. We validate causality by assessing attribution performance across representative GANs and diffusion models and by achieving source anonymization using counterfactual examples generated from causal fingerprints. Experiments show our approach outperforms existing methods in model attribution, indicating strong potential for forgery detection, model copyright tracing, and identity protection.

<div> Keywords: neuro-oncology, machine learning, molecular markers, distributionally robust optimization, survival prediction

Summary:
In the field of neuro-oncology, machine learning faces challenges due to diverse data and intricate tumor characteristics, hindering the ability of models to generalize effectively. To address these issues, researchers developed a neuro-oncology specific model with a robust loss function, enabling accurate tumor phenotype estimation and generalization across different institutions. They pre-trained self-supervised backbones on brain tumor MRI data from multiple institutions and utilized distributionally robust optimization to handle site and class imbalances. The model significantly improved molecular classification accuracy, particularly for uncommon markers, and enhanced overall survival prediction in IDH1 wild-type glioblastoma. Results showed improved marker prediction accuracy and reduced site-specific discrepancies. The approach also enhanced the interpretability of the model through highlighting tumor regions. Overall, coupling foundation models with distributionally robust optimization can lead to more accurate predictions in neuro-oncology, emphasizing the need for further validation and integration of longitudinal and interventional data for precision medicine applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.15416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuro-oncology poses unique challenges for machine learning due to heterogeneous data and tumor complexity, limiting the ability of foundation models (FMs) to generalize across cohorts. Existing FMs also perform poorly in predicting uncommon molecular markers, which are essential for treatment response and risk stratification. To address these gaps, we developed a neuro-oncology specific FM with a distributionally robust loss function, enabling accurate estimation of tumor phenotypes while maintaining cross-institution generalization. We pretrained self-supervised backbones (BYOL, DINO, MAE, MoCo) on multi-institutional brain tumor MRI and applied distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to mitigate site and class imbalance. Downstream tasks included molecular classification of common markers (MGMT, IDH1, 1p/19q, EGFR), uncommon alterations (ATRX, TP53, CDKN2A/2B, TERT), continuous markers (Ki-67, TP53), and overall survival prediction in IDH1 wild-type glioblastoma at UCSF, UPenn, and CUIMC. Our method improved molecular prediction and reduced site-specific embedding differences. At CUIMC, mean balanced accuracy rose from 0.744 to 0.785 and AUC from 0.656 to 0.676, with the largest gains for underrepresented endpoints (CDKN2A/2B accuracy 0.86 to 0.92, AUC 0.73 to 0.92; ATRX AUC 0.69 to 0.82; Ki-67 accuracy 0.60 to 0.69). For survival, c-index improved at all sites: CUIMC 0.592 to 0.597, UPenn 0.647 to 0.672, UCSF 0.600 to 0.627. Grad-CAM highlighted tumor and peri-tumoral regions, confirming interpretability. Overall, coupling FMs with DRO yields more site-invariant representations, improves prediction of common and uncommon markers, and enhances survival discrimination, underscoring the need for prospective validation and integration of longitudinal and interventional signals to advance precision neuro-oncology.

Summary:<br />
- The ORCA framework enhances the accuracy and robustness of large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by incorporating structured inference reasoning with smaller vision models.
- ORCA operates through an Observe-Reason-Critique-Act loop, querying multiple visual tools, validating cross-model inconsistencies, and refining predictions iteratively.
- It mitigates object-level hallucinations and exhibits adversarial robustness, without the need for adversarial training or defense mechanisms.
- Evaluation on hallucination benchmarks and adversarial perturbations shows significant accuracy improvements across different subsets.
- Overall, ORCA offers a promising solution for building more reliable and robust multimodal systems.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.15435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal capabilities but remain vulnerable to hallucinations from intrinsic errors and adversarial attacks from external exploitations, limiting their reliability in real-world applications. We present ORCA, an agentic reasoning framework that improves the factual accuracy and adversarial robustness of pretrained LVLMs through test-time structured inference reasoning with a suite of small vision models (less than 3B parameters). ORCA operates via an Observe--Reason--Critique--Act loop, querying multiple visual tools with evidential questions, validating cross-model inconsistencies, and refining predictions iteratively without access to model internals or retraining. ORCA also stores intermediate reasoning traces, which supports auditable decision-making. Though designed primarily to mitigate object-level hallucinations, ORCA also exhibits emergent adversarial robustness without requiring adversarial training or defense mechanisms. We evaluate ORCA across three settings: (1) clean images on hallucination benchmarks, (2) adversarially perturbed images without defense, and (3) adversarially perturbed images with defense applied. On the POPE hallucination benchmark, ORCA improves standalone LVLM performance by +3.64\% to +40.67\% across different subsets. Under adversarial perturbations on POPE, ORCA achieves an average accuracy gain of +20.11\% across LVLMs. When combined with defense techniques on adversarially perturbed AMBER images, ORCA further improves standalone LVLM performance, with gains ranging from +1.20\% to +48.00\% across evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that ORCA offers a promising path toward building more reliable and robust multimodal systems.

Summary:<br />
Region-Aware Deformable Convolution (RAD-Conv) is a novel convolutional operator that enhances neural networks' adaptability to complex image structures. Unlike traditional deformable convolutions with fixed quadrilateral sampling areas, RAD-Conv uses boundary offsets to create flexible, rectangular regions that dynamically adjust size and shape to match image content. This flexibility allows precise control over the receptive field's width and height, capturing local details and long-range dependencies efficiently, even with small 1x1 kernels. RAD-Conv's design combines the adaptability of attention mechanisms with the efficiency of standard convolutions, bridging the gap between rigid convolutional architectures and computation-heavy attention-based methods. This innovative approach offers a practical solution for building more expressive and efficient vision models. <div>

Abstract: We introduce Region-Aware Deformable Convolution (RAD-Conv), a new convolutional operator that enhances neural networks' ability to adapt to complex image structures. Unlike traditional deformable convolutions, which are limited to fixed quadrilateral sampling areas, RAD-Conv uses four boundary offsets per kernel element to create flexible, rectangular regions that dynamically adjust their size and shape to match image content. This approach allows precise control over the receptive field's width and height, enabling the capture of both local details and long-range dependencies, even with small 1x1 kernels. By decoupling the receptive field's shape from the kernel's structure, RAD-Conv combines the adaptability of attention mechanisms with the efficiency of standard convolutions. This innovative design offers a practical solution for building more expressive and efficient vision models, bridging the gap between rigid convolutional architectures and computationally costly attention-based methods.

Summary: <br /><br />
The article introduces CAGE (Continuity-Aware edGE) network for reconstructing vector floorplans directly from point-cloud density maps. Traditional corner-based representations are prone to noise and incomplete observations, leading to fragmented layouts. CAGE utilizes an edge-centric formulation, representing wall segments as directed, geometrically continuous edges for robust and coherent floorplan structures. The method employs a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed and latent queries in a denoising framework to stabilize optimization and accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on Structured3D and SceneCAD datasets demonstrate CAGE's state-of-the-art performance in room detection, corner identification, and angle estimation. The method showcases strong generalization across datasets, highlighting the effectiveness of its architectural innovations. Stay tuned for the release of code and pretrained models upon acceptance. <div>

Abstract: We present \textbf{CAGE} (\textit{Continuity-Aware edGE}) network, a \textcolor{red}{robust} framework for reconstructing vector floorplans directly from point-cloud density maps. Traditional corner-based polygon representations are highly sensitive to noise and incomplete observations, often resulting in fragmented or implausible layouts. Recent line grouping methods leverage structural cues to improve robustness but still struggle to recover fine geometric details. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{native} edge-centric formulation, modeling each wall segment as a directed, geometrically continuous edge. This representation enables inference of coherent floorplan structures, ensuring watertight, topologically valid room boundaries while improving robustness and reducing artifacts. Towards this design, we develop a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed and latent queries within a denoising framework, which not only stabilizes optimization but also accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments on Structured3D and SceneCAD show that \textbf{CAGE} achieves state-of-the-art performance, with F1 scores of 99.1\% (rooms), 91.7\% (corners), and 89.3\% (angles). The method also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization, underscoring the efficacy of our architectural innovations. Code and pretrained models will be released upon acceptance.

Summary: 
This article introduces a new approach for pulmonary nodule diagnosis using multimodal models and self-supervised learning techniques. The development of accurate models is hindered by limited labeled data and overfitting issues. The authors leverage self-supervised learning from longitudinal and multimodal medical archives to address these challenges. By curating an unlabeled dataset of patients with CT scans and electronic health records, they develop a joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) for pretraining. The approach outperforms unregularized models in an internal cohort but shows limitations in an external cohort. A synthetic environment is created to understand when JEPA may underperform. This innovative method demonstrates the advantages and limitations of leveraging unlabeled multimodal medical archives for improving predictive models in pulmonary nodule diagnosis.

Abstract: The development of multimodal models for pulmonary nodule diagnosis is limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the tendency for these models to overfit on the training distribution. In this work, we leverage self-supervised learning from longitudinal and multimodal archives to address these challenges. We curate an unlabeled set of patients with CT scans and linked electronic health records from our home institution to power joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) pretraining. After supervised finetuning, we show that our approach outperforms an unregularized multimodal model and imaging-only model in an internal cohort (ours: 0.91, multimodal: 0.88, imaging-only: 0.73 AUC), but underperforms in an external cohort (ours: 0.72, imaging-only: 0.75 AUC). We develop a synthetic environment that characterizes the context in which JEPA may underperform. This work innovates an approach that leverages unlabeled multimodal medical archives to improve predictive models and demonstrates its advantages and limitations in pulmonary nodule diagnosis.

Summary:<br />
In the paper, the researchers introduce EDGE, a novel generative distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation. The method addresses two key challenges in distilling multimodal datasets: the lack of correlation between generated images and captions, and the lack of diversity among generated samples. To overcome these challenges, they propose a generative model training workflow incorporating a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Additionally, a caption synthesis strategy is introduced to enhance text-to-image retrieval performance. Evaluation on Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets shows that EDGE outperforms existing methods in terms of both performance and efficiency. Notably, EDGE achieves results 18 times faster than the current state-of-the-art method. <div>

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small dataset from a large dataset, enabling the model trained on it to perform well on the original dataset. With the blooming of large language models and multimodal large language models, the importance of multimodal datasets, particularly image-text datasets, has grown significantly. However, existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are constrained by the Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which significantly increases the computing resource requirement, and takes days to process the distillation. In this work, we introduce EDGE, a generative distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation. Specifically, we identify two key challenges of distilling multimodal datasets with generative models: 1) The lack of correlation between generated images and captions. 2) The lack of diversity among generated samples. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel generative model training workflow with a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Furthermore, we propose a caption synthesis strategy to further improve text-to-image retrieval performance by introducing more text information. Our method is evaluated on Flickr30K, COCO, and CC3M datasets, demonstrating superior performance and efficiency compared to existing approaches. Notably, our method achieves results 18x faster than the state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Recent successful video generation systems that predict and create realistic automotive driving scenes from short video inputs assign tokenization, future state prediction (world model), and video decoding to dedicated models. These approaches often utilize large models that require significant training resources, offer limited insight into design choices, and lack publicly available code and datasets. In this work, we address these deficiencies and present OpenViGA, an open video generation system for automotive driving scenes. Our contributions are: Unlike several earlier works for video generation, such as GAIA-1, we provide a deep analysis of the three components of our system by separate quantitative and qualitative evaluation: Image tokenizer, world model, video decoder. Second, we purely build upon powerful pre-trained open source models from various domains, which we fine-tune by publicly available automotive data (BDD100K) on GPU hardware at academic scale. Third, we build a coherent video generation system by streamlining interfaces of our components. Fourth, due to public availability of the underlying models and data, we allow full reproducibility. Finally, we also publish our code and models on Github. For an image size of 256x256 at 4 fps we are able to predict realistic driving scene videos frame-by-frame with only one frame of algorithmic latency.

Summary:
- Foundation models in computational pathology (CPath) are essential for various tasks but the structure and variability of their learned representations need to be analyzed.
- Six CPath foundation models were evaluated using techniques from computational neuroscience, revealing distinct representational structures among models.
- Models such as UNI2 and Virchow2 had unique representations, while Prov-Gigapath had the most similarity with other models.
- Slide-dependence was high, but disease-dependence was relatively low across all models.
- Stain normalization reduced slide-dependence, with vision-language models showing more compact representations compared to vision-only models.
- These findings suggest ways to enhance model robustness, improve ensembling strategies, and understand how training paradigms impact model representations in CPath. Model introspection can benefit the development and deployment of foundation models in medical imaging domains.

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly developed in computational pathology (CPath) given their promise in facilitating many downstream tasks. While recent studies have evaluated task performance across models, less is known about the structure and variability of their learned representations. Here, we systematically analyze the representational spaces of six CPath foundation models using techniques popularized in computational neuroscience. The models analyzed span vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and self-distillation (UNI (v2), Virchow (v2), Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Through representational similarity analysis using H&amp;E image patches from TCGA, we find that UNI2 and Virchow2 have the most distinct representational structures, whereas Prov-Gigapath has the highest average similarity across models. Having the same training paradigm (vision-only vs. vision-language) did not guarantee higher representational similarity. The representations of all models showed a high slide-dependence, but relatively low disease-dependence. Stain normalization decreased slide-dependence for all models by a range of 5.5% (CONCH) to 20.5% (PLIP). In terms of intrinsic dimensionality, vision-language models demonstrated relatively compact representations, compared to the more distributed representations of vision-only models. These findings highlight opportunities to improve robustness to slide-specific features, inform model ensembling strategies, and provide insights into how training paradigms shape model representations. Our framework is extendable across medical imaging domains, where probing the internal representations of foundation models can help ensure effective development and deployment.

<div> Keywords: vision-language models, spatial reasoning, SmolRGPT, resource-constrained environments, multimodal intelligence

Summary: <br /><br />Recent advances in vision-language models have led to powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities, but their large size presents challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments like warehouses and robotics. To address this, SmolRGPT, a compact vision-language architecture, integrates RGB and depth cues for region-level spatial reasoning. Through a three-stage curriculum, it aligns visual and language features, enhances spatial relationship understanding, and adapts to specific datasets. Remarkably, with just 600 million parameters, SmolRGPT performs competitively on warehouse spatial reasoning benchmarks, outperforming larger models. This demonstrates the potential for efficient multimodal intelligence deployment without compromising core spatial reasoning capabilities. The code for experimentation is available on GitHub for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful multimodal reasoning, but state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on extremely large models with prohibitive computational and memory requirements. This makes their deployment challenging in resource-constrained environments such as warehouses, robotics, and industrial applications, where both efficiency and robust spatial understanding are critical. In this work, we present SmolRGPT, a compact vision-language architecture that explicitly incorporates region-level spatial reasoning by integrating both RGB and depth cues. SmolRGPT employs a three-stage curriculum that progressively align visual and language features, enables spatial relationship understanding, and adapts to task-specific datasets. We demonstrate that with only 600M parameters, SmolRGPT achieves competitive results on challenging warehouse spatial reasoning benchmarks, matching or exceeding the performance of much larger alternatives. These findings highlight the potential for efficient, deployable multimodal intelligence in real-world settings without sacrificing core spatial reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: We present Lynx, a high-fidelity model for personalized video synthesis from a single input image. Built on an open-source Diffusion Transformer (DiT) foundation model, Lynx introduces two lightweight adapters to ensure identity fidelity. The ID-adapter employs a Perceiver Resampler to convert ArcFace-derived facial embeddings into compact identity tokens for conditioning, while the Ref-adapter integrates dense VAE features from a frozen reference pathway, injecting fine-grained details across all transformer layers through cross-attention. These modules collectively enable robust identity preservation while maintaining temporal coherence and visual realism. Through evaluation on a curated benchmark of 40 subjects and 20 unbiased prompts, which yielded 800 test cases, Lynx has demonstrated superior face resemblance, competitive prompt following, and strong video quality, thereby advancing the state of personalized video generation.

<div> Pruning, backdoor attacks, deep learning, defense strategy, model interpretation

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel pruning approach for defending against backdoor attacks in deep learning models. While existing pruning methods struggle to accurately identify and remove parameters responsible for backdoor behaviors, the proposed approach incorporates a selection mechanism to target crucial parameters for both main and backdoor tasks. By employing an invertible pruning mask, the method can eliminate the backdoor task while retaining it through the inverse mask. A bi-level optimization problem is formulated to learn selection variables, a sparse invertible mask, and backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in outperforming existing pruning-based defenses, maintaining performance in low-data scenarios, and achieving competitive results compared to fine-tuning approaches. Notably, the proposed method successfully restores correct predictions for compromised samples following backdoor mitigation. <div>

Abstract: Model pruning has gained traction as a promising defense strategy against backdoor attacks in deep learning. However, existing pruning-based approaches often fall short in accurately identifying and removing the specific parameters responsible for inducing backdoor behaviors. Despite the dominance of fine-tuning-based defenses in recent literature, largely due to their superior performance, pruning remains a compelling alternative, offering greater interpretability and improved robustness in low-data regimes. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \emph{selection} mechanism to identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an \emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two complementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through the inverse mask. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem that jointly learns selection variables, a sparse invertible mask, and sample-specific backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. The inner problem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer problem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing clean-task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing pruning-based backdoor mitigation approaches, maintains strong performance under limited data conditions, and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Notably, the proposed approach is particularly effective in restoring correct predictions for compromised samples after successful backdoor mitigation.

Summary: The paper introduces Maximum Entropy Coding Quantization (MEC-Quant) as a solution to the limitations of Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) in neural networks. It addresses biases introduced by quantization, particularly in low-bit scenarios, by optimizing the structure of the learned representation. MEC-Quant leverages minimal coding length as a surrogate for entropy in lossy data coding, and incorporates a scalable reformulation based on Mixture Of Experts (MOE) to handle long-tailed distributions. Experimental results in computer vision tasks demonstrate that MEC-Quant achieves state-of-the-art performance even at extremely low-bit activations, comparable to Full Precision (FP) counterparts. This approach extends the limit of QAT and establishes a new benchmark in efficient neural network training. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.15514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) has driven much attention to produce efficient neural networks. Current QAT still obtains inferior performances compared with the Full Precision (FP) counterpart. In this work, we argue that quantization inevitably introduce biases into the learned representation, especially under the extremely low-bit setting. To cope with this issue, we propose Maximum Entropy Coding Quantization (MEC-Quant), a more principled objective that explicitly optimizes on the structure of the representation, so that the learned representation is less biased and thus generalizes better to unseen in-distribution samples. To make the objective end-to-end trainable, we propose to leverage the minimal coding length in lossy data coding as a computationally tractable surrogate for the entropy, and further derive a scalable reformulation of the objective based on Mixture Of Experts (MOE) that not only allows fast computation but also handles the long-tailed distribution for weights or activation values. Extensive experiments on various tasks on computer vision tasks prove its superiority. With MEC-Qaunt, the limit of QAT is pushed to the x-bit activation for the first time and the accuracy of MEC-Quant is comparable to or even surpass the FP counterpart. Without bells and whistles, MEC-Qaunt establishes a new state of the art for QAT.

<div> GUI-ARP, Adaptive Region Perception, Adaptive Stage Controlling, multi-stage inference, visual attention <br />

Summary: GUI-ARP is a new framework for GUI grounding that improves fine-grained localization in high-resolution screenshots. It uses Adaptive Region Perception (ARP) to crop task-relevant regions and Adaptive Stage Controlling (ASC) to adjust its inference strategy. The framework can switch between single-stage and multi-stage inference depending on the complexity of the scenario. GUI-ARP is trained using a two-phase pipeline that combines supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experimental results show that GUI-ARP outperforms existing methods, with a 7B model achieving high accuracy on challenging benchmarks like ScreenSpot-Pro and UI-Vision. GUI-ARP-7B is competitive with larger open-source models like UI-TARS-72B, demonstrating its effectiveness in GUI grounding tasks. <div>

Abstract: Existing GUI grounding methods often struggle with fine-grained localization in high-resolution screenshots. To address this, we propose GUI-ARP, a novel framework that enables adaptive multi-stage inference. Equipped with the proposed Adaptive Region Perception (ARP) and Adaptive Stage Controlling (ASC), GUI-ARP dynamically exploits visual attention for cropping task-relevant regions and adapts its inference strategy, performing a single-stage inference for simple cases and a multi-stage analysis for more complex scenarios. This is achieved through a two-phase training pipeline that integrates supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement fine-tuning based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed GUI-ARP achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging GUI grounding benchmarks, with a 7B model reaching 60.8% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro and 30.9% on UI-Vision benchmark. Notably, GUI-ARP-7B demonstrates strong competitiveness against open-source 72B models (UI-TARS-72B at 38.1%) and proprietary models.

Summary:
The paper introduces SAMPO, a novel hybrid framework for world modeling that combines visual autoregressive modeling with causal modeling. SAMPO integrates temporal causal decoding with bidirectional spatial attention to enhance temporal consistency and efficiency. An asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer is devised to optimize memory usage and model performance while preserving spatial details. A trajectory-aware motion prompt module injects spatiotemporal cues to improve temporal consistency and physical realism. Extensive experiments show that SAMPO achieves competitive performance in video prediction and model-based control tasks with faster inference. SAMPO also demonstrates zero-shot generalization and scalability to larger model sizes, showcasing its ability to generalize to unseen tasks and benefit from increased model capacity. <div>

Abstract: World models allow agents to simulate the consequences of actions in imagined environments for planning, control, and long-horizon decision-making. However, existing autoregressive world models struggle with visually coherent predictions due to disrupted spatial structure, inefficient decoding, and inadequate motion modeling. In response, we propose \textbf{S}cale-wise \textbf{A}utoregression with \textbf{M}otion \textbf{P}r\textbf{O}mpt (\textbf{SAMPO}), a hybrid framework that combines visual autoregressive modeling for intra-frame generation with causal modeling for next-frame generation. Specifically, SAMPO integrates temporal causal decoding with bidirectional spatial attention, which preserves spatial locality and supports parallel decoding within each scale. This design significantly enhances both temporal consistency and rollout efficiency. To further improve dynamic scene understanding, we devise an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer that preserves spatial details in observed frames and extracts compact dynamic representations for future frames, optimizing both memory usage and model performance. Additionally, we introduce a trajectory-aware motion prompt module that injects spatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories, focusing attention on dynamic regions and improving temporal consistency and physical realism. Extensive experiments show that SAMPO achieves competitive performance in action-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, improving generation quality with 4.4$\times$ faster inference. We also evaluate SAMPO's zero-shot generalization and scaling behavior, demonstrating its ability to generalize to unseen tasks and benefit from larger model sizes.

<div> Keywords: desire, emotion, sentiment, multimodal learning, image modeling

Summary:
Desire, emotion, and sentiment are closely related aspects of human behavior that can be captured through multimodal learning. Existing methods in sentiment analysis tend to focus on verbal cues, neglecting the potential of images as non-verbal cues. In response, a Symmetrical Bidirectional Multimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition is proposed, which leverages both text and image modalities to capture intention-related representations in images. The framework includes a text-guided image decoder and an image-guided text decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal interaction. By incorporating low-resolution images for global visual representations and high-resolution images for fine-grained local features, the approach achieves consistent improvements in desire understanding, emotion recognition, and sentiment analysis. The mixed-scale image strategy balances perceptual gains with computation cost, resulting in enhanced performance across the various tasks. <div>
arXiv:2509.15540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Desire, as an intention that drives human behavior, is closely related to both emotion and sentiment. Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and emotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire understanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis predominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary non-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional Multimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition, which enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively capture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically, low-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for cross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into sub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to capture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an image-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal interaction at both local and global representations of image information. Additionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale image strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into sub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a multimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as emotion and sentiment recognition. Experimental results indicate consistent improvements over other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Specifically, our method outperforms existing approaches, achieving F1-score improvements of 1.1% in desire understanding, 0.6% in emotion recognition, and 0.9% in sentiment analysis.

Summary:
The paper introduces a training-free framework for Referential Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) that significantly enhances the performance of existing methods. Two key components are presented: the Video-Language Checker, which verifies the presence of described objects in the video to reduce false positives, and the Key-Frame Sampler, which adaptively selects informative frames for better temporal context. Without additional training, the proposed approach achieves a J&amp;F score of 64.14% on the MeViS test set, ranking 2nd in the RVOS track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge at ICCV 2025. The framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and SAM~2 to guide video segmentation, integrating language understanding with video reasoning. The combination of these components improves the accuracy of object segmentation in videos based on natural language descriptions. <div>

Abstract: Referential Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment all objects in a video that match a given natural language description, bridging the gap between vision and language understanding. Recent work, such as Sa2VA, combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with SAM~2, leveraging the strong video reasoning capability of LLMs to guide video segmentation. In this work, we present a training-free framework that substantially improves Sa2VA's performance on the RVOS task. Our method introduces two key components: (1) a Video-Language Checker that explicitly verifies whether the subject and action described in the query actually appear in the video, thereby reducing false positives; and (2) a Key-Frame Sampler that adaptively selects informative frames to better capture both early object appearances and long-range temporal context. Without any additional training, our approach achieves a J&amp;F score of 64.14% on the MeViS test set, ranking 2nd place in the RVOS track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge at ICCV 2025.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces MS-GS, a novel framework for scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis in sparse-view scenarios using 3DGS. It leverages monocular depth estimations to provide geometric priors and utilizes local semantic regions for accurate alignment and geometry cues. By introducing geometry-guided supervision at virtual views, MS-GS ensures 3D consistency and reduces overfitting. The framework incorporates multi-view constraints through fine-grained and coarse schemes, enabling realistic renderings under challenging sparse-view and multi-appearance conditions. MS-GS outperforms existing approaches across different datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in photorealistic renderings. An in-the-wild experiment setting and dataset are introduced to establish more realistic benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2509.15548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-the-wild photo collections often contain limited volumes of imagery and exhibit multiple appearances, e.g., taken at different times of day or seasons, posing significant challenges to scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Although recent adaptations of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have improved in these areas, they tend to oversmooth and are prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework designed with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using 3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our approach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth estimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions with a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable alignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we propose a series of geometry-guided supervision at virtual views in a fine-grained and coarse scheme to encourage 3D consistency and reduce overfitting. We also introduce a dataset and an in-the-wild experiment setting to set up more realistic benchmarks. We demonstrate that MS-GS achieves photorealistic renderings under various challenging sparse-view and multi-appearance conditions and outperforms existing approaches significantly across different datasets.

Summary: Diff-Feat introduces a framework for extracting intermediate features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, showcasing optimal feature extraction processes for vision and language tasks. Through a heuristic local-search algorithm, the framework identifies the most effective feature combinations for classification tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on datasets like MS-COCO-enhanced and Visual Genome 500. Diff-Feat surpasses existing CNN, graph, and Transformer models significantly, forming tighter semantic clusters and showcasing enhanced performance in multi-label classification tasks. <div>
arXiv:2509.15553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-label classification has broad applications and depends on powerful representations capable of capturing multi-label interactions. We introduce \textit{Diff-Feat}, a simple but powerful framework that extracts intermediate features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, and fuses them for downstream tasks. We observe that for vision tasks, the most discriminative intermediate feature along the diffusion process occurs at the middle step and is located in the middle block in Transformer. In contrast, for language tasks, the best feature occurs at the noise-free step and is located in the deepest block. In particular, we observe a striking phenomenon across varying datasets: a mysterious "Layer $12$" consistently yields the best performance on various downstream classification tasks for images (under DiT-XL/2-256$\times$256). We devise a heuristic local-search algorithm that pinpoints the locally optimal "image-text"$\times$"block-timestep" pair among a few candidates, avoiding an exhaustive grid search. A simple fusion-linear projection followed by addition-of the selected representations yields state-of-the-art performance: 98.6\% mAP on MS-COCO-enhanced and 45.7\% mAP on Visual Genome 500, surpassing strong CNN, graph, and Transformer baselines by a wide margin. t-SNE and clustering metrics further reveal that \textit{Diff-Feat} forms tighter semantic clusters than unimodal counterparts.

Summary: 
Vision- and hearing-threatening diseases can lead to preventable disabilities, especially in resource-constrained settings with limited healthcare resources. The use of AI-assisted screening and telehealth shows promise in early detection, but faces challenges in practical deployment within paper-based workflows. To overcome these challenges, interdisciplinary collaboration and continuous feedback are crucial in transitioning from paper-based to AI-ready workflows. Despite performance issues, public datasets and AI models are valuable resources. Automated AI-based image quality checks are necessary to ensure reliable screening in high-volume settings. It's important to approach AI development and workflow digitization as an iterative co-design process. By documenting practical challenges and lessons learned, this study aims to provide valuable insights for implementing real-world AI-assisted telehealth and mass-screening programs in resource-constrained settings. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Vision- and hearing-threatening diseases cause preventable disability, especially in resource-constrained settings(RCS) with few specialists and limited screening setup. Large scale AI-assisted screening and telehealth has potential to expand early detection, but practical deployment is challenging in paper-based workflows and limited documented field experience exist to build upon. We provide insights on challenges and ways forward in development to adoption of scalable AI-assisted Telehealth and screening in such settings. Specifically, we find that iterative, interdisciplinary collaboration through early prototyping, shadow deployment and continuous feedback is important to build shared understanding as well as reduce usability hurdles when transitioning from paper-based to AI-ready workflows. We find public datasets and AI models highly useful despite poor performance due to domain shift. In addition, we find the need for automated AI-based image quality check to capture gradable images for robust screening in high-volume camps.
  Our field learning stress the importance of treating AI development and workflow digitization as an end-to-end, iterative co-design process. By documenting these practical challenges and lessons learned, we aim to address the gap in contextual, actionable field knowledge for building real-world AI-assisted telehealth and mass-screening programs in RCS.

Summary:
DC-Mamba is a new framework for remote sensing change detection that addresses the challenges of geometric misalignments and distinguishing true changes from noise. It integrates the Bi-Temporal Deformable Alignment module to correct spatial misalignments and the Scale-Sparse Change Amplifier module to amplify high-confidence change signals and suppress noise. The framework first establishes geometric consistency to reduce pseudo-changes and then sharpens boundaries to enhance the visibility of small or subtle targets. Experimental results show that DC-Mamba significantly improves performance over existing methods, increasing both the F1-score and IoU. The "align-then-enhance" strategy of DC-Mamba offers a robust and easily deployable solution that transparently addresses both geometric and feature-level challenges in remote sensing change detection.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.15563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) is vital for identifying land-cover changes, yet existing methods, including state-of-the-art State Space Models (SSMs), often lack explicit mechanisms to handle geometric misalignments and struggle to distinguish subtle, true changes from noise.To address this, we introduce DC-Mamba, an "align-then-enhance" framework built upon the ChangeMamba backbone. It integrates two lightweight, plug-and-play modules: (1) Bi-Temporal Deformable Alignment (BTDA), which explicitly introduces geometric awareness to correct spatial misalignments at the semantic feature level; and (2) a Scale-Sparse Change Amplifier(SSCA), which uses multi-source cues to selectively amplify high-confidence change signals while suppressing noise before the final classification. This synergistic design first establishes geometric consistency with BTDA to reduce pseudo-changes, then leverages SSCA to sharpen boundaries and enhance the visibility of small or subtle targets. Experiments show our method significantly improves performance over the strong ChangeMamba baseline, increasing the F1-score from 0.5730 to 0.5903 and IoU from 0.4015 to 0.4187. The results confirm the effectiveness of our "align-then-enhance" strategy, offering a robust and easily deployable solution that transparently addresses both geometric and feature-level challenges in RSCD.

Abstract: In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists: their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL), a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework: (1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named BTL-UI, which demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.

<div> Keywords: Salient Object Detection, Size-Invariant Evaluation, Size Sensitivity, Evaluation Protocols, Optimization Framework

Summary: 
This paper addresses the issue of size sensitivity in Salient Object Detection (SOD) evaluation protocols, where the presence of multiple salient objects of varying sizes can lead to biased performance assessments. The authors propose a Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework that evaluates each component individually to mitigate the impact of size imbalances across objects. They also introduce a model-agnostic optimization framework (SIOpt) that enhances the detection of salient objects across a range of sizes. Theoretical generalization analysis of SOD methods supports the validity of the new evaluation protocols. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach, showing significant improvement in detecting salient objects of different sizes. The code for implementing the proposed methods is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Ferry-Li/SI-SOD. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.15573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient Object Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols, particularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly different sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed. The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present generalization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the validity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments speak to the efficacy of our proposed approach. The code is available at https://github.com/Ferry-Li/SI-SOD.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of short video platforms has necessitated advanced methods for detecting fake news. This need arises from the widespread influence and ease of sharing misinformation, which can lead to significant societal harm. Current methods often struggle with the dynamic and multimodal nature of short video content. This paper presents HFN, Heterogeneous Fusion Net, a novel multimodal framework that integrates video, audio, and text data to evaluate the authenticity of short video content. HFN introduces a Decision Network that dynamically adjusts modality weights during inference and a Weighted Multi-Modal Feature Fusion module to ensure robust performance even with incomplete data. Additionally, we contribute a comprehensive dataset VESV (VEracity on Short Videos) specifically designed for short video fake news detection. Experiments conducted on the FakeTT and newly collected VESV datasets demonstrate improvements of 2.71% and 4.14% in Marco F1 over state-of-the-art methods. This work establishes a robust solution capable of effectively identifying fake news in the complex landscape of short video platforms, paving the way for more reliable and comprehensive approaches in combating misinformation.

Summary:
EyePCR introduces a new benchmark for evaluating cognitive abilities in ophthalmic surgical settings using multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The benchmark includes richly annotated data for perception, comprehension, and reasoning tasks in surgery, aiming to simulate how surgeons perceive visual cues and make decisions based on domain knowledge. EyePCR-MLLM, a domain-adapted MLLM variant, outperforms existing models in perception, comprehension, and reasoning tasks, showcasing improved cognitive abilities in surgical video analysis. The benchmark highlights the limitations of current MLLMs in surgical cognition and suggests avenues for enhancing the clinical reliability of surgical video understanding models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.15596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) have showcased remarkable capabilities, but their performance in high-stakes, domain-specific scenarios like surgical settings, remains largely under-explored. To address this gap, we develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery analysis, grounded in structured clinical knowledge to evaluate cognition across \textit{Perception}, \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}. EyePCR offers a richly annotated corpus with more than 210k VQAs, which cover 1048 fine-grained attributes for multi-view perception, medical knowledge graph of more than 25k triplets for comprehension, and four clinically grounded reasoning tasks. The rich annotations facilitate in-depth cognitive analysis, simulating how surgeons perceive visual cues and combine them with domain knowledge to make decisions, thus greatly improving models' cognitive ability. In particular, \textbf{EyePCR-MLLM}, a domain-adapted variant of Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieves the highest accuracy on MCQs for \textit{Perception} among compared models and outperforms open-source models in \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}, rivalling commercial models like GPT-4.1. EyePCR reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs in surgical cognition and lays the foundation for benchmarking and enhancing clinical reliability of surgical video understanding models.

The benchmark consists of tasks at rally and stroke levels, with 2,500 human-verified questions. An evaluation of 16 MLLMs reveals shortcomings and suggests that frame-sampling density should be customized and balanced for different tasks.

arXiv:2509.15602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at general video understanding but struggle with fast, high-frequency sports like tennis, where rally clips are short yet information-dense. To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks at rally and stroke levels and includes 2,500 human-verified questions. Evaluating 16 representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis video understanding. Results reveal substantial shortcomings and yield two key insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger reasoning.

The proposed Rasa framework leverages advanced large language models to extract relevant textual descriptions from pathology reports to enhance WSI-based survival analysis. It utilizes a self-distillation pipeline to filter out irrelevant WSI features guided by textual knowledge from a teacher model. A risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during training to improve the quantity and diversity of training data. Experimental results on CRC and TCGA-BRCA datasets show Rasa's superior effectiveness compared to existing methods.

arXiv:2509.15608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility, hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively. Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First, advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained, WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data. Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data (TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against state-of-the-art methods.

<div> framework, Pseudo-label, sample refinement, cross-modal retrieval, noisy pairs
Summary:
The study introduces the Pseudo-label Consistency-Guided Sample Refinement (PCSR) framework to improve cross-modal retrieval by addressing misaligned image-text pairs and noisy correspondences. The framework distinguishes between clean and noisy pairs using confidence-based estimation and refines noisy pairs based on pseudo-label consistency. A Pseudo-label Consistency Score (PCS) is proposed to quantify prediction stability and separate ambiguous and refinable samples within noisy pairs. Adaptive Pair Optimization (APO) optimizes ambiguous samples with robust loss functions and enhances refinable samples through text replacement. Experimental results on CC152K, MS-COCO, and Flickr30K datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PCSR in enhancing retrieval robustness under noisy supervision. <div>
arXiv:2509.15623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval aims to align different modalities via semantic similarity. However, existing methods often assume that image-text pairs are perfectly aligned, overlooking Noisy Correspondences in real data. These misaligned pairs misguide similarity learning and degrade retrieval performance. Previous methods often rely on coarse-grained categorizations that simply divide data into clean and noisy samples, overlooking the intrinsic diversity within noisy instances. Moreover, they typically apply uniform training strategies regardless of sample characteristics, resulting in suboptimal sample utilization for model optimization. To address the above challenges, we introduce a novel framework, called Pseudo-label Consistency-Guided Sample Refinement (PCSR), which enhances correspondence reliability by explicitly dividing samples based on pseudo-label consistency. Specifically, we first employ a confidence-based estimation to distinguish clean and noisy pairs, then refine the noisy pairs via pseudo-label consistency to uncover structurally distinct subsets. We further proposed a Pseudo-label Consistency Score (PCS) to quantify prediction stability, enabling the separation of ambiguous and refinable samples within noisy pairs. Accordingly, we adopt Adaptive Pair Optimization (APO), where ambiguous samples are optimized with robust loss functions and refinable ones are enhanced via text replacement during training. Extensive experiments on CC152K, MS-COCO and Flickr30K validate the effectiveness of our method in improving retrieval robustness under noisy supervision.

Summary: 
This article introduces a personalized federated Segment Anything Model (SAM) framework specifically designed for medical image segmentation with heterogeneous data. The framework combines a personalized aggregation strategy to capture commonalities across clients while preserving domain-specific features through a Localized Mixture-of-Experts (L-MoE) component. It also includes a decoupled global-local fine-tuning mechanism utilizing a teacher-student paradigm with knowledge distillation to improve segmentation performance and mitigate overgeneralization. Experiment results on two public datasets demonstrate significant enhancements in segmentation performance, robust cross-domain adaptation capabilities, and reduced communication overhead in the federated learning setting. <div>
arXiv:2509.15638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis, yet privacy constraints hinder data sharing across institutions. Federated learning addresses this limitation, but existing approaches often rely on lightweight architectures that struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown outstanding segmentation capabilities; however, its massive encoder poses significant challenges in federated settings. In this work, we present the first personalized federated SAM framework tailored for heterogeneous data scenarios in medical image segmentation. Our framework integrates two key innovations: (1) a personalized strategy that aggregates only the global parameters to capture cross-client commonalities while retaining the designed L-MoE (Localized Mixture-of-Experts) component to preserve domain-specific features; and (2) a decoupled global-local fine-tuning mechanism that leverages a teacher-student paradigm via knowledge distillation to bridge the gap between the global shared model and the personalized local models, thereby mitigating overgeneralization. Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate that our approach significantly improves segmentation performance, achieves robust cross-domain adaptation, and reduces communication overhead.

Summary:
The article introduces UNIV, a biologically inspired model for joint RGB-visible and infrared perception. It addresses the challenge of underperformance in multimodal scenarios by introducing Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL) and a dual-knowledge preservation mechanism. PCCL mimics retinal lateral inhibition for effective cross-modal feature alignment. The dual-knowledge preservation mechanism combines LoRA adapters and synchronous distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting. The model is evaluated on the MVIP dataset, showing superior performance on infrared tasks while maintaining baseline performance on visible RGB tasks. The dataset contains precisely aligned image pairs for comprehensive evaluation. UNIV demonstrates improved results in semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. The code for UNIV is available on GitHub for further exploration and usage. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.15642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for joint RGB-visible and infrared perception is growing rapidly, particularly to achieve robust performance under diverse weather conditions. Although pre-trained models for RGB-visible and infrared data excel in their respective domains, they often underperform in multimodal scenarios, such as autonomous vehicles equipped with both sensors. To address this challenge, we propose a biologically inspired UNified foundation model for Infrared and Visible modalities (UNIV), featuring two key innovations. First, we introduce Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL), an attention-guided distillation framework that mimics retinal horizontal cells' lateral inhibition, which enables effective cross-modal feature alignment while remaining compatible with any transformer-based architecture. Second, our dual-knowledge preservation mechanism emulates the retina's bipolar cell signal routing - combining LoRA adapters (2% added parameters) with synchronous distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting, thereby replicating the retina's photopic (cone-driven) and scotopic (rod-driven) functionality. To support cross-modal learning, we introduce the MVIP dataset, the most comprehensive visible-infrared benchmark to date. It contains 98,992 precisely aligned image pairs spanning diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate UNIV's superior performance on infrared tasks (+1.7 mIoU in semantic segmentation and +0.7 mAP in object detection) while maintaining 99%+ of the baseline performance on visible RGB tasks.

<div> Keywords: 3D Gaussian Splatting, training system, memory-efficient, GPU, large-scale datasets<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces GS-Scale, a training system for 3D Gaussian Splatting that addresses challenges related to high memory demands. GS-Scale utilizes host memory to store Gaussians and selectively transfers data to the GPU, reducing GPU memory usage significantly. Three system-level optimizations are implemented to mitigate slowdowns caused by CPU limitations, including offloading geometric parameters, combining CPU optimizer updates with GPU computation, and deferring updates to minimize memory accesses. Evaluations show that GS-Scale can reduce GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x while maintaining training speeds comparable to GPU-only approaches. This enables large-scale training on consumer-grade GPUs, with substantial improvements in learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) achievable on datasets with millions of Gaussians. <div>
arXiv:2509.15645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized graphics rendering by delivering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds. However, training large-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial memory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states, which can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we propose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian Splatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a subset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this dramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and optimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's limited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three system-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters for fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer updates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize unnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly lowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds comparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian Splatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the number of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU, leading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity) improvement.

Abstract: Researchers have conducted many pioneer researches on contactless fingerprints, yet the performance of contactless fingerprint recognition still lags behind contact-based methods primary due to the insufficient contactless fingerprint data with pose variations and lack of the usage of implicit 3D fingerprint representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel contactless fingerprint 3D registration, reconstruction and generation framework by integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting, with the goal of offering a new paradigm for contactless fingerprint recognition that integrates 3D fingerprint reconstruction and generation. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply 3D Gaussian Splatting to the field of fingerprint recognition, and the first to achieve effective 3D registration and complete reconstruction of contactless fingerprints with sparse input images and without requiring camera parameters information. Experiments on 3D fingerprint registration, reconstruction, and generation prove that our method can accurately align and reconstruct 3D fingerprints from 2D images, and sequentially generates high-quality contactless fingerprints from 3D model, thus increasing the performances for contactless fingerprint recognition.

Abstract: Point cloud data represents a crucial category of information for mathematical modeling, and surface reconstruction from such data is an important task across various disciplines. However, during the scanning process, the collected point cloud data may fail to cover the entire surface due to factors such as high light-absorption rate and occlusions, resulting in incomplete datasets. Inferring surface structures in data-missing regions and successfully reconstructing the surface poses a challenge. In this paper, we present a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based model for surface reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data. Initially, we employ PCA to estimate the normal information of the underlying surface from the available point cloud data. This estimated normal information serves as a regularizer in our model, guiding the reconstruction of the surface, particularly in areas with missing data. Additionally, we introduce an operator-splitting method to effectively solve the proposed model. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate that our model successfully infers surface structures in data-missing regions and well reconstructs the underlying surfaces, outperforming existing methodologies.

Abstract: We propose Camera Splatting, a novel view optimization framework for novel view synthesis. Each camera is modeled as a 3D Gaussian, referred to as a camera splat, and virtual cameras, termed point cameras, are placed at 3D points sampled near the surface to observe the distribution of camera splats. View optimization is achieved by continuously and differentiably refining the camera splats so that desirable target distributions are observed from the point cameras, in a manner similar to the original 3D Gaussian splatting. Compared to the Farthest View Sampling (FVS) approach, our optimized views demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex view-dependent phenomena, including intense metallic reflections and intricate textures such as text.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.15678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handwriting stroke generation is crucial for improving the performance of tasks such as handwriting recognition and writers order recovery. In handwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the sample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the calligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word spacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in inconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These multi-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features. Secondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word spacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional diffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly generated style images. Stroke generation provides additional temporal coordinate information, which is lacking in image generation. Hence, our proposed conditional diffusion model for stroke generation is guided by calligraphic style and word layout for better handwriting imitation and stroke generation in a calligraphic style. Our experimentation shows that the proposed diffusion model outperforms the current state-of-the-art stroke generation and is competitive with recent image generation networks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.15688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) requires distinguishing between visually similar categories through subtle, localized features - a task that remains challenging due to high intra-class variability and limited inter-class differences. Existing part-based methods often rely on complex localization networks that learn mappings from pixel to sample space, requiring a deep understanding of image content while limiting feature utility for downstream tasks. In addition, sampled points frequently suffer from high spatial redundancy, making it difficult to quantify the optimal number of required parts. Inspired by human saccadic vision, we propose a two-stage process that first extracts peripheral features (coarse view) and generates a sample map, from which fixation patches are sampled and encoded in parallel using a weight-shared encoder. We employ contextualized selective attention to weigh the impact of each fixation patch before fusing peripheral and focus representations. To prevent spatial collapse - a common issue in part-based methods - we utilize non-maximum suppression during fixation sampling to eliminate redundancy. Comprehensive evaluation on standard FGVC benchmarks (CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Food-101 and Stanford-Dogs) and challenging insect datasets (EU-Moths, Ecuador-Moths and AMI-Moths) demonstrates that our method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches while consistently outperforming our baseline encoder.

<title>SCENEFORGE: Enhancing 3D-text alignment with Structured Scene Compositions</title>

Abstract: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts-even in 3D-text contrastive learning. We introduce SceneForge, a novel framework that enhances contrastive alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured multi-object scene compositions. SceneForge leverages individual 3D shapes to construct multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairing them with coherent multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model. By augmenting contrastive training with these structured, compositional samples, SceneForge effectively addresses the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets, significantly enriching data complexity and diversity. We systematically investigate critical design elements, such as the optimal number of objects per scene, the proportion of compositional samples in training batches, and scene construction strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneForge delivers substantial performance gains across multiple tasks, including zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet, as well as few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart. SceneForge's compositional augmentations are model-agnostic, consistently improving performance across multiple encoder architectures. Moreover, SceneForge improves 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, generalizes robustly to retrieval scenarios with increasing scene complexity, and showcases spatial reasoning capabilities by adapting spatial configurations to align precisely with textual instructions.

<title>ORIC: Benchmarking Object Recognition in Incongruous Context for Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in image caption, visual question answering, and robotics by integrating visual and textual information. However, they remain prone to errors in incongruous contexts, where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent when contextually expected. This leads to two key recognition failures: object misidentification and hallucination. To systematically examine this issue, we introduce the Object Recognition in Incongruous Context Benchmark (ORIC), a novel benchmark that evaluates LVLMs in scenarios where object-context relationships deviate from expectations. ORIC employs two key strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling, which identifies objects that are present but contextually incongruous, and (2) CLIP-guided sampling, which detects plausible yet nonexistent objects that are likely to be hallucinated, thereby creating an incongruous context. Evaluating 18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detection models, our results reveal significant recognition gaps, underscoring the challenges posed by contextual incongruity. This work provides critical insights into LVLMs' limitations and encourages further research on context-aware object recognition.

<title>Training-Free Pyramid Token Pruning for Efficient Large Vision-Language Models via Region, Token, and Instruction-Guided Importance</title>

arXiv:2509.15704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal understanding but still struggle with efficiently processing high-resolution images. Recent approaches partition high-resolution images into multiple sub-images, dramatically increasing the number of visual tokens and causing exponential computational overhead during inference. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free token pruning strategy, Pyramid Token Pruning (PTP), that integrates bottom-up visual saliency at both region and token levels with top-down instruction-guided importance. Inspired by human visual attention mechanisms, PTP selectively retains more tokens from visually salient regions and further leverages textual instructions to pinpoint tokens most relevant to specific multimodal tasks. Extensive experiments across 13 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces computational overhead and inference latency with minimal performance loss.

<title>SGMAGNet: A Baseline Model for 3D Cloud Phase Structure Reconstruction on a New Passive Active Satellite Benchmark</title>

Abstract: Cloud phase profiles are critical for numerical weather prediction (NWP), as they directly affect radiative transfer and precipitation processes. In this study, we present a benchmark dataset and a baseline framework for transforming multimodal satellite observations into detailed 3D cloud phase structures, aiming toward operational cloud phase profile retrieval and future integration with NWP systems to improve cloud microphysics parameterization. The multimodal observations consist of (1) high--spatiotemporal--resolution, multi-band visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery from geostationary satellites, and (2) accurate vertical cloud phase profiles from spaceborne lidar (CALIOP\slash CALIPSO) and radar (CPR\slash CloudSat). The dataset consists of synchronized image--profile pairs across diverse cloud regimes, defining a supervised learning task: given VIS/TIR patches, predict the corresponding 3D cloud phase structure. We adopt SGMAGNet as the main model and compare it with several baseline architectures, including UNet variants and SegNet, all designed to capture multi-scale spatial patterns. Model performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-score, and IoU. The results demonstrate that SGMAGNet achieves superior performance in cloud phase reconstruction, particularly in complex multi-layer and boundary transition regions. Quantitatively, SGMAGNet attains a Precision of 0.922, Recall of 0.858, F1-score of 0.763, and an IoU of 0.617, significantly outperforming all baselines across these key metrics.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI in medical imaging has introduced both significant opportunities and serious challenges, especially the risk that fake medical images could undermine healthcare systems. These synthetic images pose serious risks, such as diagnostic deception, financial fraud, and misinformation. However, research on medical forensics to counter these threats remains limited, and there is a critical lack of comprehensive datasets specifically tailored for this field. Additionally, existing media forensic methods, which are primarily designed for natural or facial images, are inadequate for capturing the distinct characteristics and subtle artifacts of AI-generated medical images. To tackle these challenges, we introduce \textbf{MedForensics}, a large-scale medical forensics dataset encompassing six medical modalities and twelve state-of-the-art medical generative models. We also propose \textbf{DSKI}, a novel \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tage \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{I}nfusing detector that constructs a vision-language feature space tailored for the detection of AI-generated medical images. DSKI comprises two core components: 1) a cross-domain fine-trace adapter (CDFA) for extracting subtle forgery clues from both spatial and noise domains during training, and 2) a medical forensic retrieval module (MFRM) that boosts detection accuracy through few-shot retrieval during testing. Experimental results demonstrate that DSKI significantly outperforms both existing methods and human experts, achieving superior accuracy across multiple medical modalities.

arXiv:2509.15741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has made synthetic image detection an increasingly critical task. Most existing approaches attempt to construct a single, universal discriminative space to separate real from fake content. However, such unified spaces tend to be complex and brittle, often struggling to generalize to unseen generative patterns. In this work, we propose TrueMoE, a novel dual-routing Mixture-of-Discriminative-Experts framework that reformulates the detection task as a collaborative inference across multiple specialized and lightweight discriminative subspaces. At the core of TrueMoE is a Discriminative Expert Array (DEA) organized along complementary axes of manifold structure and perceptual granularity, enabling diverse forgery cues to be captured across subspaces. A dual-routing mechanism, comprising a granularity-aware sparse router and a manifold-aware dense router, adaptively assigns input images to the most relevant experts. Extensive experiments across a wide spectrum of generative models demonstrate that TrueMoE achieves superior generalization and robustness.

<title>Hybrid Lie semi-group and cascade structures for the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15748</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.15748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field responses computed in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy may be strongly influenced by such geometric image transformations. One way of handling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive field families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of freedom in the image transformations.
  This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of the shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive fields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships, roughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie groups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which describe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales can be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output from corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales, structurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional preferences.
  The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different values of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more efficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of multi-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating idealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological vision.

Abstract: Reconstructing building floor plans from point cloud data is key for indoor navigation, BIM, and precise measurements. Traditional methods like geometric algorithms and Mask R-CNN-based deep learning often face issues with noise, limited generalization, and loss of geometric details. We propose FloorSAM, a framework that integrates point cloud density maps with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for accurate floor plan reconstruction from LiDAR data. Using grid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement, we create robust top-down density maps. FloorSAM uses SAM's zero-shot learning for precise room segmentation, improving reconstruction across diverse layouts. Room masks are generated via adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering, followed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and regularization. This produces accurate floor plans and recovers room topological relationships. Tests on Giblayout and ISPRS datasets show better accuracy, recall, and robustness than traditional methods, especially in noisy and complex settings.

Abstract: Recent self-supervised learning models simulate the development of semantic object representations by training on visual experience similar to that of toddlers. However, these models ignore the foveated nature of human vision with high/low resolution in the center/periphery of the visual field. Here, we investigate the role of this varying resolution in the development of object representations. We leverage two datasets of egocentric videos that capture the visual experience of humans during interactions with objects. We apply models of human foveation and cortical magnification to modify these inputs, such that the visual content becomes less distinct towards the periphery. The resulting sequences are used to train two bio-inspired self-supervised learning models that implement a time-based learning objective. Our results show that modeling aspects of foveated vision improves the quality of the learned object representations in this setting. Our analysis suggests that this improvement comes from making objects appear bigger and inducing a better trade-off between central and peripheral visual information. Overall, this work takes a step towards making models of humans' learning of visual representations more realistic and performant.

<title>MCOD: The First Challenging Benchmark for Multispectral Camouflaged Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects that blend seamlessly into natural scenes. Although RGB-based methods have advanced, their performance remains limited under challenging conditions. Multispectral imagery, providing rich spectral information, offers a promising alternative for enhanced foreground-background discrimination. However, existing COD benchmark datasets are exclusively RGB-based, lacking essential support for multispectral approaches, which has impeded progress in this area. To address this gap, we introduce MCOD, the first challenging benchmark dataset specifically designed for multispectral camouflaged object detection. MCOD features three key advantages: (i) Comprehensive challenge attributes: It captures real-world difficulties such as small object sizes and extreme lighting conditions commonly encountered in COD tasks. (ii) Diverse real-world scenarios: The dataset spans a wide range of natural environments to better reflect practical applications. (iii) High-quality pixel-level annotations: Each image is manually annotated with precise object masks and corresponding challenge attribute labels. We benchmark eleven representative COD methods on MCOD, observing a consistent performance drop due to increased task difficulty. Notably, integrating multispectral modalities substantially alleviates this degradation, highlighting the value of spectral information in enhancing detection robustness. We anticipate MCOD will provide a strong foundation for future research in multispectral camouflaged object detection. The dataset is publicly accessible at https://github.com/yl2900260-bit/MCOD.

Abstract: Plot images are essential for ecological studies, enabling standardized sampling, biodiversity assessment, long-term monitoring and remote, large-scale surveys. Plot images are typically fifty centimetres or one square meter in size, and botanists meticulously identify all the species found there. The integration of AI could significantly improve the efficiency of specialists, helping them to extend the scope and coverage of ecological studies. To evaluate advances in this regard, the PlantCLEF 2024 challenge leverages a new test set of thousands of multi-label images annotated by experts and covering over 800 species. In addition, it provides a large training set of 1.7 million individual plant images as well as state-of-the-art vision transformer models pre-trained on this data. The task is evaluated as a (weakly-labeled) multi-label classification task where the aim is to predict all the plant species present on a high-resolution plot image (using the single-label training data). In this paper, we provide an detailed description of the data, the evaluation methodology, the methods and models employed by the participants and the results achieved.

<title>Vision-Language Models as Differentiable Semantic and Spatial Rewards for Text-to-3D Generation</title>

Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) enables high-quality text-to-3D generation by supervising 3D models through the denoising of multi-view 2D renderings, using a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model to align with the input prompt and ensure 3D consistency. However, existing SDS-based methods face two fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on CLIP-style text encoders leads to coarse semantic alignment and struggles with fine-grained prompts; and (2) 2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, resulting in geometric inconsistencies and inaccurate object relationships in multi-object scenes. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a novel text-to-3D generation framework that integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) into the SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors. Unlike standard text-to-image diffusion priors, VLMs leverage rich language-grounded supervision that enables fine-grained prompt alignment. Moreover, their inherent vision language modeling provides strong spatial understanding, which significantly enhances 3D consistency for single-object generation and improves relational reasoning in multi-object scenes. We instantiate VLM3D based on the open-source Qwen2.5-VL model and evaluate it on the GPTeval3D benchmark. Experiments across diverse objects and complex scenes show that VLM3D significantly outperforms prior SDS-based methods in semantic fidelity, geometric coherence, and spatial correctness.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) is a challenging task with wide applications such as video editing and autonomous driving. While Cutie provides strong query-based segmentation and SAM2 offers enriched representations via a pretrained ViT encoder, each has limitations in feature capacity and temporal modeling. In this report, we propose a framework that integrates their complementary strengths by replacing the encoder of Cutie with the ViT encoder of SAM2 and introducing a motion prediction module for temporal stability. We further adopt an ensemble strategy combining Cutie, SAM2, and our variant, achieving 3rd place in the MOSEv2 track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge. We refer to our final model as SCOPE (SAM2-CUTIE Object Prediction Ensemble). This demonstrates the effectiveness of enriched feature representation and motion prediction for robust video object segmentation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.15784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized image registration by its ability to handle diverse tasks while achieving significant speed advantages over conventional approaches. Current approaches, however, often employ globally uniform smoothness constraints that fail to accommodate the complex, regionally varying deformations characteristic of anatomical motion. To address this limitation, we propose SegReg, a Segmentation-driven Registration framework that implements anatomically adaptive regularization by exploiting region-specific deformation patterns. Our SegReg first decomposes input moving and fixed images into anatomically coherent subregions through segmentation. These localized domains are then processed by the same registration backbone to compute optimized partial deformation fields, which are subsequently integrated into a global deformation field. SegReg achieves near-perfect structural alignment (98.23% Dice on critical anatomies) using ground-truth segmentation, and outperforms existing methods by 2-12% across three clinical registration scenarios (cardiac, abdominal, and lung images) even with automatic segmentation. Our SegReg demonstrates a near-linear dependence of registration accuracy on segmentation quality, transforming the registration challenge into a segmentation problem. The source code will be released upon manuscript acceptance.

<title>CBPNet: A Continual Backpropagation Prompt Network for Alleviating Plasticity Loss on Edge Devices</title>

arXiv:2509.15785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To meet the demands of applications like robotics and autonomous driving that require real-time responses to dynamic environments, efficient continual learning methods suitable for edge devices have attracted increasing attention. In this transition, using frozen pretrained models with prompts has become a mainstream strategy to combat catastrophic forgetting. However, this approach introduces a new critical bottleneck: plasticity loss, where the model's ability to learn new knowledge diminishes due to the frozen backbone and the limited capacity of prompt parameters. We argue that the reduction in plasticity stems from a lack of update vitality in underutilized parameters during the training process. To this end, we propose the Continual Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet), an effective and parameter efficient framework designed to restore the model's learning vitality. We innovatively integrate an Efficient CBP Block that counteracts plasticity decay by adaptively reinitializing these underutilized parameters. Experimental results on edge devices demonstrate CBPNet's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks. On Split CIFAR-100, it improves average accuracy by over 1% against a strong baseline, and on the more challenging Split ImageNet-R, it achieves a state of the art accuracy of 69.41%. This is accomplished by training additional parameters that constitute less than 0.2% of the backbone's size, validating our approach.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress achieved in remote sensing semantic change detection (SCD), two major challenges remain. At the data level, existing SCD datasets suffer from limited change categories, insufficient change types, and a lack of fine-grained class definitions, making them inadequate to fully support practical applications. At the methodological level, most current approaches underutilize change information, typically treating it as a post-processing step to enhance spatial consistency, which constrains further improvements in model performance. To address these issues, we construct a new benchmark for remote sensing SCD, LevirSCD. Focused on the Beijing area, the dataset covers 16 change categories and 210 specific change types, with more fine-grained class definitions (e.g., roads are divided into unpaved and paved roads). Furthermore, we propose a foreground-background co-guided SCD (FoBa) method, which leverages foregrounds that focus on regions of interest and backgrounds enriched with contextual information to guide the model collaboratively, thereby alleviating semantic ambiguity while enhancing its ability to detect subtle changes. Considering the requirements of bi-temporal interaction and spatial consistency in SCD, we introduce a Gated Interaction Fusion (GIF) module along with a simple consistency loss to further enhance the model's detection performance. Extensive experiments on three datasets (SECOND, JL1, and the proposed LevirSCD) demonstrate that FoBa achieves competitive results compared to current SOTA methods, with improvements of 1.48%, 3.61%, and 2.81% in the SeK metric, respectively. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/zmoka-zht/FoBa.

<title>Minimal Semantic Sufficiency Meets Unsupervised Domain Generalization</title>

Abstract: The generalization ability of deep learning has been extensively studied in supervised settings, yet it remains less explored in unsupervised scenarios. Recently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed to enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised learning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the challenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels. Although some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue, such domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper, we address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves all semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii) maximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We theoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information theory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency and minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we implement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a learnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve sufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel semantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism for capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new state-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or domain labels during representation learning.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot segmentation capabilities across natural image domains, but it struggles to generalize to the unique challenges of remote sensing data, such as complex terrain, multi-scale objects, and temporal dynamics. In this paper, we introduce TASAM, a terrain and temporally-aware extension of SAM designed specifically for high-resolution remote sensing image segmentation. TASAM integrates three lightweight yet effective modules: a terrain-aware adapter that injects elevation priors, a temporal prompt generator that captures land-cover changes over time, and a multi-scale fusion strategy that enhances fine-grained object delineation. Without retraining the SAM backbone, our approach achieves substantial performance gains across three remote sensing benchmarks-LoveDA, iSAID, and WHU-CD-outperforming both zero-shot SAM and task-specific models with minimal computational overhead. Our results highlight the value of domain-adaptive augmentation for foundation models and offer a scalable path toward more robust geospatial segmentation.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art video understanding methods typically struggle with two critical challenges: (1) the computational infeasibility of processing every frame in dense video content and (2) the difficulty in identifying semantically significant frames through naive uniform sampling strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel video understanding framework, called ChronoForge-RL, which combines Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) and KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (KF-GRPO) to tackle these issues. Concretely, we introduce a differentiable keyframe selection mechanism that systematically identifies semantic inflection points through a three-stage process to enhance computational efficiency while preserving temporal information. Then, two particular modules are proposed to enable effective temporal reasoning: Firstly, TAD leverages variation scoring, inflection detection, and prioritized distillation to select the most informative frames. Secondly, we introduce KF-GRPO which implements a contrastive learning paradigm with a saliency-enhanced reward mechanism that explicitly incentivizes models to leverage both frame content and temporal relationships. Finally, our proposed ChronoForge-RL achieves 69.1% on VideoMME and 52.7% on LVBench compared to baseline methods, clearly surpassing previous approaches while enabling our 7B parameter model to achieve performance comparable to 72B parameter alternatives.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models exhibit a significant yet under-explored "brand bias", a tendency to generate contents featuring dominant commercial brands from generic prompts, posing ethical and legal risks. We propose CIDER, a novel, model-agnostic framework to mitigate bias at inference-time through prompt refinement to avoid costly retraining. CIDER uses a lightweight detector to identify branded content and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate stylistically divergent alternatives. We introduce the Brand Neutrality Score (BNS) to quantify this issue and perform extensive experiments on leading T2I models. Results show CIDER significantly reduces both explicit and implicit biases while maintaining image quality and aesthetic appeal. Our work offers a practical solution for more original and equitable content, contributing to the development of trustworthy generative AI.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is at the core of Active Learning (AL). Most existing methods resort to complex auxiliary models and advanced training fashions to estimate uncertainty for unlabeled data. These models need special design and hence are difficult to train especially for domain tasks, such as Cryo-Electron Tomography (cryo-ET) classification in computational biology. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method using knowledge transfer to boost uncertainty estimation in AL. Specifically, we exploit the teacher-student mode where the teacher is the task model in AL and the student is an auxiliary model that learns from the teacher. We train the two models simultaneously in each AL cycle and adopt a certain distance between the model outputs to measure uncertainty for unlabeled data. The student model is task-agnostic and does not rely on special training fashions (e.g. adversarial), making our method suitable for various tasks. More importantly, we demonstrate that data uncertainty is not tied to concrete value of task loss but closely related to the upper-bound of task loss. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the proposed method on classical computer vision tasks and cryo-ET challenges. The results demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency.

<title>LC-SLab -- An Object-based Deep Learning Framework for Large-scale Land Cover Classification from Satellite Imagery and Sparse In-situ Labels</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15868</link>

Abstract: Large-scale land cover maps generated using deep learning play a critical role across a wide range of Earth science applications. Open in-situ datasets from principled land cover surveys offer a scalable alternative to manual annotation for training such models. However, their sparse spatial coverage often leads to fragmented and noisy predictions when used with existing deep learning-based land cover mapping approaches. A promising direction to address this issue is object-based classification, which assigns labels to semantically coherent image regions rather than individual pixels, thereby imposing a minimum mapping unit. Despite this potential, object-based methods remain underexplored in deep learning-based land cover mapping pipelines, especially in the context of medium-resolution imagery and sparse supervision. To address this gap, we propose LC-SLab, the first deep learning framework for systematically exploring object-based deep learning methods for large-scale land cover classification under sparse supervision. LC-SLab supports both input-level aggregation via graph neural networks, and output-level aggregation by postprocessing results from established semantic segmentation models. Additionally, we incorporate features from a large pre-trained network to improve performance on small datasets. We evaluate the framework on annual Sentinel-2 composites with sparse LUCAS labels, focusing on the tradeoff between accuracy and fragmentation, as well as sensitivity to dataset size. Our results show that object-based methods can match or exceed the accuracy of common pixel-wise models while producing substantially more coherent maps. Input-level aggregation proves more robust on smaller datasets, whereas output-level aggregation performs best with more data. Several configurations of LC-SLab also outperform existing land cover products, highlighting the framework's practical utility.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in 3D scenes based on text prompts, which is essential for applications such as robotics. However, existing 3DVG methods encounter two main challenges: first, they struggle to handle the implicit representation of spatial textures in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), making per-scene training indispensable; second, they typically require larges amounts of labeled data for effective training. To this end, we propose \underline{G}rounding via \underline{V}iew \underline{R}etrieval (GVR), a novel zero-shot visual grounding framework for 3DGS to transform 3DVG as a 2D retrieval task that leverages object-level view retrieval to collect grounding clues from multiple views, which not only avoids the costly process of 3D annotation, but also eliminates the need for per-scene training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual grounding performance while avoiding per-scene training, providing a solid foundation for zero-shot 3DVG research.

arXiv:2509.15874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ENSAM (Equivariant, Normalized, Segment Anything Model), a lightweight and promptable model for universal 3D medical image segmentation. ENSAM combines a SegResNet-based encoder with a prompt encoder and mask decoder in a U-Net-style architecture, using latent cross-attention, relative positional encoding, normalized attention, and the Muon optimizer for training. ENSAM is designed to achieve good performance under limited data and computational budgets, and is trained from scratch on under 5,000 volumes from multiple modalities (CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, microscopy) on a single 32 GB GPU in 6 hours. As part of the CVPR 2025 Foundation Models for Interactive 3D Biomedical Image Segmentation Challenge, ENSAM was evaluated on hidden test set with multimodal 3D medical images, obtaining a DSC AUC of 2.404, NSD AUC of 2.266, final DSC of 0.627, and final NSD of 0.597, outperforming two previously published baseline models (VISTA3D, SAM-Med3D) and matching the third (SegVol), surpassing its performance in final DSC but trailing behind in the other three metrics. In the coreset track of the challenge, ENSAM ranks 5th of 10 overall and best among the approaches not utilizing pretrained weights. Ablation studies confirm that our use of relative positional encodings and the Muon optimizer each substantially speed up convergence and improve segmentation quality.

<title>Self-Supervised Cross-Modal Learning for Image-to-Point Cloud Registration</title>

arXiv:2509.15882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bridging 2D and 3D sensor modalities is critical for robust perception in autonomous systems. However, image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration remains challenging due to the semantic-geometric gap between texture-rich but depth-ambiguous images and sparse yet metrically precise point clouds, as well as the tendency of existing methods to converge to local optima. To overcome these limitations, we introduce CrossI2P, a self-supervised framework that unifies cross-modal learning and two-stage registration in a single end-to-end pipeline. First, we learn a geometric-semantic fused embedding space via dual-path contrastive learning, enabling annotation-free, bidirectional alignment of 2D textures and 3D structures. Second, we adopt a coarse-to-fine registration paradigm: a global stage establishes superpoint-superpixel correspondences through joint intra-modal context and cross-modal interaction modeling, followed by a geometry-constrained point-level refinement for precise registration. Third, we employ a dynamic training mechanism with gradient normalization to balance losses for feature alignment, correspondence refinement, and pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CrossI2P outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 23.7% on the KITTI Odometry benchmark and by 37.9% on nuScenes, significantly improving both accuracy and robustness.

<title>RACap: Relation-Aware Prompting for Lightweight Retrieval-Augmented Image Captioning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.15883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent retrieval-augmented image captioning methods incorporate external knowledge to compensate for the limitations in comprehending complex scenes. However, current approaches face challenges in relation modeling: (1) the representation of semantic prompts is too coarse-grained to capture fine-grained relationships; (2) these methods lack explicit modeling of image objects and their semantic relationships. To address these limitations, we propose RACap, a relation-aware retrieval-augmented model for image captioning, which not only mines structured relation semantics from retrieval captions, but also identifies heterogeneous objects from the image. RACap effectively retrieves structured relation features that contain heterogeneous visual information to enhance the semantic consistency and relational expressiveness. Experimental results show that RACap, with only 10.8M trainable parameters, achieves superior performance compared to previous lightweight captioning models.

<title>RangeSAM: Leveraging Visual Foundation Models for Range-View repesented LiDAR segmentation</title>

Abstract: Point cloud segmentation is central to autonomous driving and 3D scene understanding. While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation, coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods using VFMs leads to promising results.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.15891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stereo matching achieves significant progress with iterative algorithms like RAFT-Stereo and IGEV-Stereo. However, these methods struggle in ill-posed regions with occlusions, textureless, or repetitive patterns, due to a lack of global context and geometric information for effective iterative refinement. To enable the existing iterative approaches to incorporate global context, we propose the Global Regulation and Excitation via Attention Tuning (GREAT) framework which encompasses three attention modules. Specifically, Spatial Attention (SA) captures the global context within the spatial dimension, Matching Attention (MA) extracts global context along epipolar lines, and Volume Attention (VA) works in conjunction with SA and MA to construct a more robust cost-volume excited by global context and geometric details. To verify the universality and effectiveness of this framework, we integrate it into several representative iterative stereo-matching methods and validate it through extensive experiments, collectively denoted as GREAT-Stereo. This framework demonstrates superior performance in challenging ill-posed regions. Applied to IGEV-Stereo, among all published methods, our GREAT-IGEV ranks first on the Scene Flow test set, KITTI 2015, and ETH3D leaderboards, and achieves second on the Middlebury benchmark. Code is available at https://github.com/JarvisLee0423/GREAT-Stereo.

Abstract: Deep Feedback Models (DFMs) are a new class of stateful neural networks that combine bottom up input with high level representations over time. This feedback mechanism introduces dynamics into otherwise static architectures, enabling DFMs to iteratively refine their internal state and mimic aspects of biological decision making. We model this process as a differential equation solved through a recurrent neural network, stabilized via exponential decay to ensure convergence. To evaluate their effectiveness, we measure DFMs under two key conditions: robustness to noise and generalization with limited data. In both object recognition and segmentation tasks, DFMs consistently outperform their feedforward counterparts, particularly in low data or high noise regimes. In addition, DFMs translate to medical imaging settings, while being robust against various types of noise corruption. These findings highlight the importance of feedback in achieving stable, robust, and generalizable learning. Code is available at https://github.com/DCalhas/deep_feedback_models.

Abstract: The ability to interpret and comprehend a 3D scene is essential for many vision and robotics systems. In numerous applications, this involves 3D object detection, i.e.~identifying the location and dimensions of objects belonging to a specific category, typically represented as bounding boxes. This has traditionally been solved by training to detect a fixed set of categories, which limits its use. In this work, we investigate open-vocabulary 3D object detection in the challenging yet practical sparse-view setting, where only a limited number of posed RGB images are available as input. Our approach is training-free, relying on pre-trained, off-the-shelf 2D foundation models instead of employing computationally expensive 3D feature fusion or requiring 3D-specific learning. By lifting 2D detections and directly optimizing 3D proposals for featuremetric consistency across views, we fully leverage the extensive training data available in 2D compared to 3D. Through standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that this simple pipeline establishes a powerful baseline, performing competitively with state-of-the-art techniques in densely sampled scenarios while significantly outperforming them in the sparse-view setting.

Abstract: Camera-radar fusion offers a robust and low-cost alternative to Camera-lidar fusion for the 3D object detection task in real-time under adverse weather and lighting conditions. However, currently, in the literature, it is possible to find few works focusing on this modality and, most importantly, developing new architectures to explore the advantages of the radar point cloud, such as accurate distance estimation and speed information. Therefore, this work presents a novel and efficient 3D object detection algorithm using cameras and radars in the bird's-eye-view (BEV). Our algorithm exploits the advantages of radar before fusing the features into a detection head. A new backbone is introduced, which maps the radar pillar features into an embedded dimension. A self-attention mechanism allows the backbone to model the dependencies between the radar points. We are using a simplified convolutional layer to replace the FPN-based convolutional layers used in the PointPillars-based architectures with the main goal of reducing inference time. Our results show that with this modification, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art in the 3D object detection problem, reaching 58.2 of the NDS metric for the use of ResNet-50, while also setting a new benchmark for inference time on the nuScenes dataset for the same category.

Abstract: Precise yield prediction is essential for agricultural sustainability and food security. However, climate change complicates accurate yield prediction by affecting major factors such as weather conditions, soil fertility, and farm management systems. Advances in technology have played an essential role in overcoming these challenges by leveraging satellite monitoring and data analysis for precise yield estimation. Current methods rely on spatio-temporal data for predicting crop yield, but they often struggle with multi-spectral data, which is crucial for evaluating crop health and growth patterns. To resolve this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-Temporal Multi-Spectral Yield Prediction Network, MTMS-YieldNet, that integrates spectral data with spatio-temporal information to effectively capture the correlations and dependencies between them. While existing methods that rely on pre-trained models trained on general visual data, MTMS-YieldNet utilizes contrastive learning for feature discrimination during pre-training, focusing on capturing spatial-spectral patterns and spatio-temporal dependencies from remote sensing data. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the excellence of the proposed MTMS-YieldNet over seven existing state-of-the-art methods. MTMS-YieldNet achieves MAPE scores of 0.336 on Sentinel-1, 0.353 on Landsat-8, and an outstanding 0.331 on Sentinel-2, demonstrating effective yield prediction performance across diverse climatic and seasonal conditions. The outstanding performance of MTMS-YieldNet improves yield predictions and provides valuable insights that can assist farmers in making better decisions, potentially improving crop yields.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence is increasingly employed to understand the decision-making process of deep learning models and create trustworthiness in their adoption. However, the explainability of Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) remains largely unexplored despite its wide deployment in real-world applications. In this work, we study how to analyze MDE networks to map the input image to the predicted depth map. More in detail, we investigate well-established feature attribution methods, Saliency Maps, Integrated Gradients, and Attention Rollout on different computationally complex models for MDE: METER, a lightweight network, and PixelFormer, a deep network. We assess the quality of the generated visual explanations by selectively perturbing the most relevant and irrelevant pixels, as identified by the explainability methods, and analyzing the impact of these perturbations on the model's output. Moreover, since existing evaluation metrics can have some limitations in measuring the validity of visual explanations for MDE, we additionally introduce the Attribution Fidelity. This metric evaluates the reliability of the feature attribution by assessing their consistency with the predicted depth map. Experimental results demonstrate that Saliency Maps and Integrated Gradients have good performance in highlighting the most important input features for MDE lightweight and deep models, respectively. Furthermore, we show that Attribution Fidelity effectively identifies whether an explainability method fails to produce reliable visual maps, even in scenarios where conventional metrics might suggest satisfactory results.

Abstract: Recently, data-driven trajectory prediction methods have achieved remarkable results, significantly advancing the development of autonomous driving. However, the instability of single-vehicle perception introduces certain limitations to trajectory prediction. In this paper, a novel lightweight framework for cooperative trajectory prediction, CoPAD, is proposed. This framework incorporates a fusion module based on the Hungarian algorithm and Kalman filtering, along with the Past Time Attention (PTA) module, mode attention module and anchor-oriented decoder (AoD). It effectively performs early fusion on multi-source trajectory data from vehicles and road infrastructure, enabling the trajectories with high completeness and accuracy. The PTA module can efficiently capture potential interaction information among historical trajectories, and the mode attention module is proposed to enrich the diversity of predictions. Additionally, the decoder based on sparse anchors is designed to generate the final complete trajectories. Extensive experiments show that CoPAD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DAIR-V2X-Seq dataset, validating the effectiveness of the model in cooperative trajectory prediction in V2X scenarios.

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation is crucial for 3D scene understanding, but existing methods often blur depth at object boundaries, introducing spurious intermediate 3D points. While achieving sharp edges usually requires very fine-grained supervision, our method produces crisp depth discontinuities using only self-supervision. Specifically, we model per-pixel depth as a mixture distribution, capturing multiple plausible depths and shifting uncertainty from direct regression to the mixture weights. This formulation integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines via variance-aware loss functions and uncertainty propagation. Extensive evaluations on KITTI and VKITTIv2 show that our method achieves up to 35% higher boundary sharpness and improves point cloud quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

arXiv:2509.16011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language-guided supervision, which utilizes a frozen semantic target from a Pretrained Language Model (PLM), has emerged as a promising paradigm for visual Continual Learning (CL). However, relying on a single target introduces two critical limitations: 1) semantic ambiguity, where a polysemous category name results in conflicting visual representations, and 2) intra-class visual diversity, where a single prototype fails to capture the rich variety of visual appearances within a class. To this end, we propose MuproCL, a novel framework that replaces the single target with multiple, context-aware prototypes. Specifically, we employ a lightweight LLM agent to perform category disambiguation and visual-modal expansion to generate a robust set of semantic prototypes. A LogSumExp aggregation mechanism allows the vision model to adaptively align with the most relevant prototype for a given image. Extensive experiments across various CL baselines demonstrate that MuproCL consistently enhances performance and robustness, establishing a more effective path for language-guided continual learning.

Abstract: Multimodal image matching seeks pixel-level correspondences between images of different modalities, crucial for cross-modal perception, fusion and analysis. However, the significant appearance differences between modalities make this task challenging. Due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets, existing deep learning methods that extract modality-common features for matching perform poorly and lack adaptability to diverse scenarios. Vision Foundation Model (VFM), trained on large-scale data, yields generalizable and robust feature representations adapted to data and tasks of various modalities, including multimodal matching. Thus, we propose DistillMatch, a multimodal image matching method using knowledge distillation from VFM. DistillMatch employs knowledge distillation to build a lightweight student model that extracts high-level semantic features from VFM (including DINOv2 and DINOv3) to assist matching across modalities. To retain modality-specific information, it extracts and injects modality category information into the other modality's features, which enhances the model's understanding of cross-modal correlations. Furthermore, we design V2I-GAN to boost the model's generalization by translating visible to pseudo-infrared images for data augmentation. Experiments show that DistillMatch outperforms existing algorithms on public datasets.

Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to explore the common clustering structure across multiple views. Many existing MVC methods heavily rely on the assumption of view consistency, where alignments for corresponding samples across different views are ordered in advance. However, real-world scenarios often present a challenge as only partial data is consistently aligned across different views, restricting the overall clustering performance. In this work, we consider the model performance decreasing phenomenon caused by data order shift (i.e., from fully to partially aligned) as a generalized multi-view clustering problem. To tackle this problem, we design a causal multi-view clustering network, termed CauMVC. We adopt a causal modeling approach to understand multi-view clustering procedure. To be specific, we formulate the partially aligned data as an intervention and multi-view clustering with partially aligned data as an post-intervention inference. However, obtaining invariant features directly can be challenging. Thus, we design a Variational Auto-Encoder for causal learning by incorporating an encoder from existing information to estimate the invariant features. Moreover, a decoder is designed to perform the post-intervention inference. Lastly, we design a contrastive regularizer to capture sample correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to deal generalized multi-view clustering via causal learning. Empirical experiments on both fully and partially aligned data illustrate the strong generalization and effectiveness of CauMVC.

<title>GLip: A Global-Local Integrated Progressive Framework for Robust Visual Speech Recognition</title>

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR), also known as lip reading, is the task of recognizing speech from silent video. Despite significant advancements in VSR over recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world visual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and pose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local Integrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon two key insights: (i) learning an initial \textit{coarse} alignment between visual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content facilitates the subsequent learning of \textit{precise} visual-to-speech mappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain local regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues for lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path feature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features within a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the model learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding acoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a coarse yet semantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features with relevant global context across both spatial and temporal dimensions, refining the coarse representations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our framework uniquely exploits discriminative local regions through a progressive learning strategy, demonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual challenges and consistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3 benchmarks. We further validate its effectiveness on a newly introduced challenging Mandarin dataset.

Abstract: Generating continuous surfaces from discrete point cloud data is a fundamental task in several 3D vision applications. Real-world point clouds are inherently noisy due to various technical and environmental factors. Existing data-driven surface reconstruction algorithms rely heavily on ground truth normals or compute approximate normals as an intermediate step. This dependency makes them extremely unreliable for noisy point cloud datasets, even if the availability of ground truth training data is ensured, which is not always the case. B-spline reconstruction techniques provide compact surface representations of point clouds and are especially known for their smoothening properties. However, the complexity of the surfaces approximated using B-splines is directly influenced by the number and location of the spline control points. Existing spline-based modeling methods predict the locations of a fixed number of control points for a given point cloud, which makes it very difficult to match the complexity of its underlying surface. In this work, we develop a Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network-based surface reconstruction strategy where we simultaneously predict both the location and the number of control points for noisy point cloud data to generate smooth surfaces without the use of any point normals. We compare our reconstruction method with several well-known as well as recent baselines by employing widely-used evaluation metrics, and demonstrate that our method outperforms all of them both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<title>Language-Instructed Reasoning for Group Activity Detection via Multimodal Large Language Model</title>

Abstract: Group activity detection (GAD) aims to simultaneously identify group members and categorize their collective activities within video sequences. Existing deep learning-based methods develop specialized architectures (e.g., transformer networks) to model the dynamics of individual roles and semantic dependencies between individuals and groups. However, they rely solely on implicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual reasoning and explainability. In this work, we propose LIR-GAD, a novel framework of language-instructed reasoning for GAD via Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Our approach expand the original vocabulary of MLLM by introducing an activity-level  token and multiple cluster-specific  tokens. We process video frames alongside two specially designed tokens and language instructions, which are then integrated into the MLLM. The pretrained commonsense knowledge embedded in the MLLM enables the  token and  tokens to effectively capture the semantic information of collective activities and learn distinct representational features of different groups, respectively. Also, we introduce a multi-label classification loss to further enhance the  token's ability to learn discriminative semantic representations. Then, we design a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module that integrates MLLM's hidden embeddings corresponding to the designed tokens with visual features, significantly enhancing the performance of GAD. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method in GAD taks.

Abstract: We introduce SEE&amp;TREK, the first training-free prompting framework tailored to enhance the spatial understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMS) under vision-only constraints. While prior efforts have incorporated modalities like depth or point clouds to improve spatial reasoning, purely visualspatial understanding remains underexplored. SEE&amp;TREK addresses this gap by focusing on two core principles: increasing visual diversity and motion reconstruction. For visual diversity, we conduct Maximum Semantic Richness Sampling, which employs an off-the-shell perception model to extract semantically rich keyframes that capture scene structure. For motion reconstruction, we simulate visual trajectories and encode relative spatial positions into keyframes to preserve both spatial relations and temporal coherence. Our method is training&amp;GPU-free, requiring only a single forward pass, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLM'S. Extensive experiments on the VSI-B ENCH and STI-B ENCH show that S EE &amp;T REK consistently boosts various MLLM S performance across diverse spatial reasoning tasks with the most +3.5% improvement, offering a promising path toward stronger spatial intelligence.

Abstract: In this work, we present Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion, a novel self-supervised framework for real-world image denoising. Our approach addresses two major challenges: the limitations of blind-spot networks (BSNs), which often sacrifice local detail and introduce pixel discontinuities due to spatial independence assumptions, and the difficulty of adapting diffusion models to self-supervised denoising. We propose a dual-branch diffusion framework that combines a BSN-based diffusion branch, generating semi-clean images, with a conventional diffusion branch that captures underlying noise distributions. To enable effective training without paired data, we use the BSN-based branch to guide the sampling process, capturing noise structure while preserving local details. Extensive experiments on the SIDD and DND datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, establishing our method as a highly effective self-supervised solution for real-world denoising. Code and pre-trained models are released at: https://github.com/Sumching/BSGD.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction in multi-agent sports scenarios is inherently challenging due to the structural heterogeneity across agent roles (e.g., players vs. ball) and dynamic distribution gaps across different sports domains. Existing unified frameworks often fail to capture these structured distributional shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization across roles and domains. We propose AdaSports-Traj, an adaptive trajectory modeling framework that explicitly addresses both intra-domain and inter-domain distribution discrepancies in sports. At its core, AdaSports-Traj incorporates a Role- and Domain-Aware Adapter to conditionally adjust latent representations based on agent identity and domain context. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Contrastive Learning objective, which separately supervises role-sensitive and domain-aware representations to encourage disentangled latent structures without introducing optimization conflict. Experiments on three diverse sports datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptive design, achieving strong performance in both unified and cross-domain trajectory prediction settings.

<title>SegDINO3D: 3D Instance Segmentation Empowered by Both Image-Level and Object-Level 2D Features</title>

arXiv:2509.16098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present SegDINO3D, a novel Transformer encoder-decoder framework for 3D instance segmentation. As 3D training data is generally not as sufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D representation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both image-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation. SegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In the encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image features from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for 3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D anchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries obtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries serve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively avoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory while faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The introducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate cross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D instance segmentation benchmarks. Notably, on the challenging ScanNet200 dataset, SegDINO3D significantly outperforms prior methods by +8.7 and +6.8 mAP on the validation and hidden test sets, respectively, demonstrating its superiority.

Abstract: 4D automotive radars have gained increasing attention for autonomous driving due to their low cost, robustness, and inherent velocity measurement capability. However, existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely heavily on pillar encoders for BEV feature extraction, where each point contributes to only a single BEV grid, resulting in sparse feature maps and degraded representation quality. In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes independently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their inference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the real-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these limitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely RadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and distributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding boxes. In RadarGaussianDet3D, a novel Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) is designed to transform each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation and employs the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique for BEV rasterization, yielding denser feature maps. PGE exhibits exceptionally low latency, owing to the optimized algorithm for point feature aggregation and fast rendering of 3DGS. In addition, a new Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) is proposed, which converts bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions and measures their distance to enable more comprehensive and consistent optimization. Extensive experiments on TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft demonstrate that RadarGaussianDet3D achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering substantially faster inference, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in autonomous driving.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made aligning them with human preferences a critical challenge. Reward Models (RMs) are a core technology for achieving this goal, but a systematic guide for building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) is currently lacking in both academia and industry. Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this paper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance MRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM development pipeline, including \textit{reward modeling paradigms} (e.g., Naive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), \textit{reward head architecture}, \textit{training strategies}, \textit{data curation} (covering over ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), \textit{backbone model} and \textit{model scale}, and \textit{ensemble methods}.
  Based on these experimental insights, we introduce \textbf{BaseReward}, a powerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling. BaseReward adopts a simple yet effective architecture, built upon a {Qwen2.5-VL} backbone, featuring an optimized two-layer reward head, and is trained on a carefully curated mixture of high-quality multimodal and text-only preference data. Our results show that BaseReward establishes a new SOTA on major benchmarks such as MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, and Multimodal Reward Bench, outperforming previous models. Furthermore, to validate its practical utility beyond static benchmarks, we integrate BaseReward into a real-world reinforcement learning pipeline, successfully enhancing an MLLM's performance across various perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks. This work not only delivers a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the next generation of MLLMs.

Abstract: We aim to recover the geometry of 3D parametric scenes using very few depth measurements from low-cost, commercially available time-of-flight sensors. These sensors offer very low spatial resolution (i.e., a single pixel), but image a wide field-of-view per pixel and capture detailed time-of-flight data in the form of time-resolved photon counts. This time-of-flight data encodes rich scene information and thus enables recovery of simple scenes from sparse measurements. We investigate the feasibility of using a distributed set of few measurements (e.g., as few as 15 pixels) to recover the geometry of simple parametric scenes with a strong prior, such as estimating the 6D pose of a known object. To achieve this, we design a method that utilizes both feed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters, and differentiable rendering within an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine the scene parameter estimate. We develop hardware prototypes and demonstrate that our method effectively recovers object pose given an untextured 3D model in both simulations and controlled real-world captures, and show promising initial results for other parametric scenes. We additionally conduct experiments to explore the limits and capabilities of our imaging solution.

arXiv:2509.16141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have recently achieved remarkable success in generating images from textual descriptions. However, challenges still persist in accurately rendering complex scenes where actions and interactions form the primary semantic focus. Our key observation in this work is that T2I models frequently struggle to capture nuanced and often implicit attributes inherent in action depiction, leading to generating images that lack key contextual details. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce AcT2I, a benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of T2I models in generating images from action-centric prompts. We experimentally validate that leading T2I models do not fare well on AcT2I. We further hypothesize that this shortcoming arises from the incomplete representation of the inherent attributes and contextual dependencies in the training corpora of existing T2I models. We build upon this by developing a training-free, knowledge distillation technique utilizing Large Language Models to address this limitation. Specifically, we enhance prompts by incorporating dense information across three dimensions, observing that injecting prompts with temporal details significantly improves image generation accuracy, with our best model achieving an increase of 72%. Our findings highlight the limitations of current T2I methods in generating images that require complex reasoning and demonstrate that integrating linguistic knowledge in a systematic way can notably advance the generation of nuanced and contextually accurate images.

arXiv:2509.16149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary capabilities in conducting conversations based on image inputs. However, we observe that MLLMs exhibit a pronounced form of visual sycophantic behavior. While similar behavior has also been noted in text-based large language models (LLMs), it becomes significantly more prominent when MLLMs process image inputs. We refer to this phenomenon as the "sycophantic modality gap." To better understand this issue, we further analyze the factors that contribute to the exacerbation of this gap. To mitigate the visual sycophantic behavior, we first experiment with naive supervised fine-tuning to help the MLLM resist misleading instructions from the user. However, we find that this approach also makes the MLLM overly resistant to corrective instructions (i.e., stubborn even if it is wrong). To alleviate this trade-off, we propose Sycophantic Reflective Tuning (SRT), which enables the MLLM to engage in reflective reasoning, allowing it to determine whether a user's instruction is misleading or corrective before drawing a conclusion. After applying SRT, we observe a significant reduction in sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions, without resulting in excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective instructions.

arXiv:2509.16163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) excel in multimodal understanding but are prone to adversarial attacks. Existing defenses often demand costly retraining or significant architecture changes. We introduce a lightweight defense using tensor decomposition suitable for any pre-trained VLM, requiring no retraining. By decomposing and reconstructing vision encoder representations, it filters adversarial noise while preserving meaning. Experiments with CLIP on COCO and Flickr30K show improved robustness. On Flickr30K, it restores 12.3\% performance lost to attacks, raising Recall@1 accuracy from 7.5\% to 19.8\%. On COCO, it recovers 8.1\% performance, improving accuracy from 3.8\% to 11.9\%. Analysis shows Tensor Train decomposition with low rank (8-32) and low residual strength ($\alpha=0.1-0.2$) is optimal. This method is a practical, plug-and-play solution with minimal overhead for existing VLMs.

arXiv:2509.16170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal image segmentation faces real-world deployment challenges from incomplete/corrupted modalities degrading performance. While existing methods address training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination models, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model subsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified modality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical self-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges representation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input, feature and output levels. %
First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the intrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for missing modalities through cross-modal fusion. %
Next, modality-invariant contrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among incomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight reverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual semantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid consistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality combinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and whistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under diverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D semantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation. The code will be released at https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/UniMRSeg.

arXiv:2509.16179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Otsu thresholding algorithm represents a fundamental technique in image segmentation, yet its computational efficiency is severely limited by exhaustive search requirements across all possible threshold values. This work presents an optimized implementation that leverages the bisection method to exploit the unimodal characteristics of the between-class variance function. Our approach reduces the computational complexity from O(L) to O(log L) evaluations while preserving segmentation accuracy. Experimental validation on 48 standard test images demonstrates a 91.63% reduction in variance computations and 97.21% reduction in algorithmic iterations compared to conventional exhaustive search. The bisection method achieves exact threshold matches in 66.67% of test cases, with 95.83% exhibiting deviations within 5 gray levels. The algorithm maintains universal convergence within theoretical logarithmic bounds while providing deterministic performance guarantees suitable for real-time applications. This optimization addresses critical computational bottlenecks in large-scale image processing systems without compromising the theoretical foundations or segmentation quality of the original Otsu method.

Abstract: Unified multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that can both understand and generate visual content hold immense potential. However, existing open-source models often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We present Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially reduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated training recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image tokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe over understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both capabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models, and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich evaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from scaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.

Abstract: Role-playing agents (RPAs) have attracted growing interest for their ability to simulate immersive and interactive characters. However, existing approaches primarily focus on static role profiles, overlooking the dynamic perceptual abilities inherent to humans. To bridge this gap, we introduce the concept of dynamic role profiles by incorporating video modality into RPAs. To support this, we construct Role-playing-Video60k, a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising 60k videos and 700k corresponding dialogues. Based on this dataset, we develop a comprehensive RPA framework that combines adaptive temporal sampling with both dynamic and static role profile representations. Specifically, the dynamic profile is created by adaptively sampling video frames and feeding them to the LLM in temporal order, while the static profile consists of (1) character dialogues from training videos during fine-tuning, and (2) a summary context from the input video during inference. This joint integration enables RPAs to generate greater responses. Furthermore, we propose a robust evaluation method covering eight metrics. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the importance of dynamic role profiles in developing RPAs.

Abstract: Industrial workflows demand adaptive and trustworthy assistance that can operate under limited computing, connectivity, and strict privacy constraints. In this work, we present MICA (Multi-Agent Industrial Coordination Assistant), a perception-grounded and speech-interactive system that delivers real-time guidance for assembly, troubleshooting, part queries, and maintenance. MICA coordinates five role-specialized language agents, audited by a safety checker, to ensure accurate and compliant support. To achieve robust step understanding, we introduce Adaptive Step Fusion (ASF), which dynamically blends expert reasoning with online adaptation from natural speech feedback. Furthermore, we establish a new multi-agent coordination benchmark across representative task categories and propose evaluation metrics tailored to industrial assistance, enabling systematic comparison of different coordination topologies. Our experiments demonstrate that MICA consistently improves task success, reliability, and responsiveness over baseline structures, while remaining deployable on practical offline hardware. Together, these contributions highlight MICA as a step toward deployable, privacy-preserving multi-agent assistants for dynamic factory environments. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Kratos-Wen/MICA.

Abstract: Orientation-rich images, such as fingerprints and textures, often exhibit coherent angular directional patterns that are challenging to model using standard generative approaches based on isotropic Euclidean diffusion. Motivated by the role of phase synchronization in biological systems, we propose a score-based generative model built on periodic domains by leveraging stochastic Kuramoto dynamics in the diffusion process. In neural and physical systems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled oscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for structured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs \textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally coupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase, gradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The reverse process then performs \textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse patterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach enables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical generation process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale details. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware networks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive results on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation quality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures. Ultimately, this work demonstrates the promise of biologically inspired synchronization dynamics as structured priors in generative modeling.

<title>Global Pre-fixing, Local Adjusting: A Simple yet Effective Contrastive Strategy for Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) involves acquiring and accumulating knowledge from evolving tasks while alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Recently, leveraging contrastive loss to construct more transferable and less forgetful representations has been a promising direction in CL. Despite advancements, their performance is still limited due to confusion arising from both inter-task and intra-task features. To address the problem, we propose a simple yet effective contrastive strategy named \textbf{G}lobal \textbf{P}re-fixing, \textbf{L}ocal \textbf{A}djusting for \textbf{S}upervised \textbf{C}ontrastive learning (GPLASC). Specifically, to avoid task-level confusion, we divide the entire unit hypersphere of representations into non-overlapping regions, with the centers of the regions forming an inter-task pre-fixed \textbf{E}quiangular \textbf{T}ight \textbf{F}rame (ETF). Meanwhile, for individual tasks, our method helps regulate the feature structure and form intra-task adjustable ETFs within their respective allocated regions. As a result, our method \textit{simultaneously} ensures discriminative feature structures both between tasks and within tasks and can be seamlessly integrated into any existing contrastive continual learning framework. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness.

Abstract: Plug-and-Play Priors (PnP) is a popular framework for solving imaging inverse problems by integrating learned priors in the form of denoisers trained to remove Gaussian noise from images. In standard PnP methods, the denoiser is applied directly in the image domain, serving as an implicit prior on natural images. This paper considers an alternative analysis formulation of PnP, in which the prior is imposed on a transformed representation of the image, such as its gradient. Specifically, we train a Gaussian denoiser to operate in the gradient domain, rather than on the image itself. Conceptually, this is an extension of total variation (TV) regularization to learned TV regularization. To incorporate this gradient-domain prior in image reconstruction algorithms, we develop two analysis PnP algorithms based on half-quadratic splitting (APnP-HQS) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (APnP-ADMM). We evaluate our approach on image deblurring and super-resolution, demonstrating that the analysis formulation achieves performance comparable to image-domain PnP algorithms.

<title>Incorporating Visual Cortical Lateral Connection Properties into CNN: Recurrent Activation and Excitatory-Inhibitory Separation</title>

Abstract: The original Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their modern updates such as the ResNet are heavily inspired by the mammalian visual system. These models include afferent connections (retina and LGN to the visual cortex) and long-range projections (connections across different visual cortical areas). However, in the mammalian visual system, there are connections within each visual cortical area, known as lateral (or horizontal) connections. These would roughly correspond to connections within CNN feature maps, and this important architectural feature is missing in current CNN models. In this paper, we present how such lateral connections can be modeled within the standard CNN framework, and test its benefits and analyze its emergent properties in relation to the biological visual system. We will focus on two main architectural features of lateral connections: (1) recurrent activation and (2) separation of excitatory and inhibitory connections. We show that recurrent CNN using weight sharing is equivalent to lateral connections, and propose a custom loss function to separate excitatory and inhibitory weights. The addition of these two leads to increased classification accuracy, and importantly, the activation properties and connection properties of the resulting model show properties similar to those observed in the biological visual system. We expect our approach to help align CNN closer to its biological counterpart and better understand the principles of visual cortical computation.

<title>Latent Zoning Network: A Unified Principle for Generative Modeling, Representation Learning, and Classification</title>

Abstract: Generative modeling, representation learning, and classification are three core problems in machine learning (ML), yet their state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions remain largely disjoint. In this paper, we ask: Can a unified principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN) as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images, text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently (representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously (joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders, LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA classification accuracy on CIFAR10. The code and trained models are available at https://github.com/microsoft/latent-zoning-networks. The project website is at https://zinanlin.me/blogs/latent_zoning_networks.html.

Abstract: Micro-ultrasound (micro-US) is a promising imaging technique for cancer detection and computer-assisted visualization. This study investigates prostate capsule segmentation using deep learning techniques from micro-US images, addressing the challenges posed by the ambiguous boundaries of the prostate capsule. Existing methods often struggle in such cases, motivating the development of a tailored approach. This study introduces an adaptive focal loss function that dynamically emphasizes both hard and easy regions, taking into account their respective difficulty levels and annotation variability. The proposed methodology has two primary strategies: integrating a standard focal loss function as a baseline to design an adaptive focal loss function for proper prostate capsule segmentation. The focal loss baseline provides a robust foundation, incorporating class balancing and focusing on examples that are difficult to classify. The adaptive focal loss offers additional flexibility, addressing the fuzzy region of the prostate capsule and annotation variability by dilating the hard regions identified through discrepancies between expert and non-expert annotations. The proposed method dynamically adjusts the segmentation model's weights better to identify the fuzzy regions of the prostate capsule. The proposed adaptive focal loss function demonstrates superior performance, achieving a mean dice coefficient (DSC) of 0.940 and a mean Hausdorff distance (HD) of 1.949 mm in the testing dataset. These results highlight the effectiveness of integrating advanced loss functions and adaptive techniques into deep learning models. This enhances the accuracy of prostate capsule segmentation in micro-US images, offering the potential to improve clinical decision-making in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of breast tumors in magnetic resonance images (MRI) is essential for breast cancer diagnosis, yet existing methods face challenges in capturing irregular tumor shapes and effectively integrating local and global features. To address these limitations, we propose an uncertainty-gated deformable network to leverage the complementary information from CNN and Transformers. Specifically, we incorporates deformable feature modeling into both convolution and attention modules, enabling adaptive receptive fields for irregular tumor contours. We also design an Uncertainty-Gated Enhancing Module (U-GEM) to selectively exchange complementary features between CNN and Transformer based on pixel-wise uncertainty, enhancing both local and global representations. Additionally, a Boundary-sensitive Deep Supervision Loss is introduced to further improve tumor boundary delineation. Comprehensive experiments on two clinical breast MRI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its clinical potential for accurate breast tumor delineation.

Abstract: Reliable whole slide imaging (WSI) hinges on image quality,yet staining artefacts, defocus, and cellular degradations are common. We present DPC-QA Net, a no-reference dual-stream network that couples wavelet-based global difference perception with cellular quality assessment from nuclear and membrane embeddings via an Aggr-RWKV module. Cross-attention fusion and multi-term losses align perceptual and cellular cues. Across different datasets, our model detects staining, membrane, and nuclear issues with >92% accuracy and aligns well with usability scores; on LIVEC and KonIQ it outperforms state-of-the-art NR-IQA. A downstream study further shows strong positive correlations between predicted quality and cell recognition accuracy (e.g., nuclei PQ/Dice, membrane boundary F-score), enabling practical pre-screening of WSI regions for computational pathology.

Abstract: Image denoising plays a critical role in biomedical and microscopy imaging, especially when acquiring wide-field fluorescence-stained images. This task faces challenges in multiple fronts, including limitations in image acquisition conditions, complex noise types, algorithm adaptability, and clinical application demands. Although many deep learning-based denoising techniques have demonstrated promising results, further improvements are needed in preserving image details, enhancing algorithmic efficiency, and increasing clinical interpretability. We propose an unsupervised image denoising method based on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. The approach introduces a multi-scale adaptive generator based on the Wavelet Transform and a dual-branch discriminator that integrates difference perception feature maps with original features. Experimental results on multiple biomedical microscopy image datasets show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance, particularly excelling in the preservation of high-frequency information. Furthermore, the dual-branch discriminator is seamlessly compatible with various GAN frameworks. The proposed quality-aware, wavelet-driven GAN denoising model is termed as QWD-GAN.

Abstract: In the realm of distributed AI and privacy-focused medical applications, we propose a framework for multi-view clustering that links quantum field theory with federated healthcare analytics. Our method uses heat-kernel coefficients from spectral analysis to convert Euclidean distances into geometry-aware similarity measures, capturing the structure of diverse medical data. We lay this out through the Heat Kernel Distance (HKD) transformation with convergence guarantees. Two algorithms are developed: Heat Kernel-Enhanced Multi-View Fuzzy Clustering (HK-MVFC) for central analysis, and Federated Heat Kernel Multi-View Fuzzy Clustering (FedHK-MVFC) for secure, privacy-preserving learning across hospitals using differential privacy and secure aggregation to facilitate HIPAA-compliant collaboration. Tests on synthetic datasets of cardiovascular patients show an $8-12 \%$ increase in clustering accuracy, $70 \%$ reduced communication, and $98.2 \%$ efficiency retention over centralized methods. Validated on 10,000 patient records across two hospitals, it proves useful for collaborative phenotyping involving ECG, cardiac imaging, and behavioral data. Our theoretical contributions include update rules with proven convergence, adaptive view weighting, and privacy-preserving protocols. This presents a new standard for geometry-aware federated learning in healthcare, turning advanced math into workable solutions for analyzing sensitive medical data while ensuring both rigor and clinical relevance.

Abstract: Imbalanced classification datasets pose significant challenges in machine learning, often leading to biased models that perform poorly on underrepresented classes. With the rise of foundation models, recent research has focused on the full, partial, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of these models to deal with long-tail classification. Despite the impressive performance of these works on the benchmark datasets, they still fail to close the gap with the networks trained using the balanced datasets and still require substantial computational resources, even for relatively smaller datasets. Underscoring the importance of computational efficiency and simplicity, in this work we propose a novel framework that leverages the rich semantic latent space of Vision Foundation Models to generate synthetic data and train a simple linear classifier using a mixture of real and synthetic data for long-tail classification. The computational efficiency gain arises from the number of trainable parameters that are reduced to just the number of parameters in the linear model. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art for the CIFAR-100-LT benchmark and demonstrates strong performance on the Places-LT benchmark, highlighting the effectiveness and adaptability of our simple and effective approach.

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction from multi-view videos remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. While recent neural surface reconstruction methods have achieved remarkable results in static 3D reconstruction, extending these approaches with comparable quality for dynamic scenes introduces significant computational and representational challenges. Existing dynamic methods focus on novel-view synthesis, therefore, their extracted meshes tend to be noisy. Even approaches aiming for geometric fidelity often result in too smooth meshes due to the ill-posedness of the problem. We present a novel framework for highly detailed dynamic reconstruction that extends the static 3D reconstruction method NeuralAngelo to work in dynamic settings. To that end, we start with a high-quality template scene reconstruction from the initial frame using NeuralAngelo, and then jointly optimize deformation fields that track the template and refine it based on the temporal sequence. This flexible template allows updating the geometry to include changes that cannot be modeled with the deformation field, for instance occluded parts or the changes in the topology. We show superior reconstruction accuracy in comparison to previous state-of-the-art methods on the ActorsHQ dataset.

Abstract: Leukemia diagnosis primarily relies on manual microscopic analysis of bone marrow morphology supported by additional laboratory parameters, making it complex and time consuming. While artificial intelligence (AI) solutions have been proposed, most utilize private datasets and only cover parts of the diagnostic pipeline. Therefore, we present a large, high-quality, publicly available leukemia bone marrow dataset spanning the entire diagnostic process, from cell detection to diagnosis. Using this dataset, we further propose methods for cell detection, cell classification, and diagnosis prediction. The dataset comprises 246 pediatric patients with diagnostic, clinical and laboratory information, over 40 000 cells with bounding box annotations and more than 28 000 of these with high-quality class labels, making it the most comprehensive dataset publicly available. Evaluation of the AI models yielded an average precision of 0.96 for the cell detection, an area under the curve of 0.98, and an F1-score of 0.61 for the 33-class cell classification, and a mean F1-score of 0.90 for the diagnosis prediction using predicted cell counts. While the proposed approaches demonstrate their usefulness for AI-assisted diagnostics, the dataset will foster further research and development in the field, ultimately contributing to more precise diagnoses and improved patient outcomes.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training holds the promise to advance 3D medical object detection, a crucial component of accurate computer-aided diagnosis. Yet, it remains underexplored compared to segmentation, where pre-training has already demonstrated significant benefits. Existing pre-training approaches for 3D object detection rely on 2D medical data or natural image pre-training, failing to fully leverage 3D volumetric information. In this work, we present the first systematic study of how existing pre-training methods can be integrated into state-of-the-art detection architectures, covering both CNNs and Transformers. Our results show that pre-training consistently improves detection performance across various tasks and datasets. Notably, reconstruction-based self-supervised pre-training outperforms supervised pre-training, while contrastive pre-training provides no clear benefit for 3D medical object detection.

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems have made notable progress, but their performance in long-tail, safety-critical scenarios remains limited. These rare cases contribute a disproportionate number of accidents. Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have strong reasoning abilities and offer a potential solution, but their effectiveness is limited by the lack of high-quality data and inefficient learning in such conditions. To address these challenges, we propose CoReVLA, a continual learning end-to-end autonomous driving framework that improves the performance in long-tail scenarios through a dual-stage process of data Collection and behavior Refinement. First, the model is jointly fine-tuned on a mixture of open-source driving QA datasets, allowing it to acquire a foundational understanding of driving scenarios. Next, CoReVLA is deployed within the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) simulation platform, where driver takeover data is collected from real-time interactions. Each takeover indicates a long-tail scenario that CoReVLA fails to handle reliably. Finally, the model is refined via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), allowing it to learn directly from human preferences and thereby avoid reward hacking caused by manually designed rewards. Extensive open-loop and closed-loop experiments demonstrate that the proposed CoReVLA model can accurately perceive driving scenarios and make appropriate decisions. On the Bench2Drive benchmark, CoReVLA achieves a Driving Score (DS) of 72.18 and a Success Rate (SR) of 50%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 7.96 DS and 15% SR under long-tail, safety-critical scenarios. Furthermore, case studies demonstrate the model's ability to continually improve its performance in similar failure-prone scenarios by leveraging past takeover experiences.

Abstract: Brain MRI scans are often found in four modalities, consisting of T1-weighted with and without contrast enhancement (T1ce and T1w), T2-weighted imaging (T2w), and Flair. Leveraging complementary information from these different modalities enables models to learn richer, more discriminative features for understanding brain anatomy, which could be used in downstream tasks such as anomaly detection. However, in clinical practice, not all MRI modalities are always available due to various reasons. This makes missing modality generation a critical challenge in medical image analysis. In this paper, we propose SLaM-DiMM, a novel missing modality generation framework that harnesses the power of diffusion models to synthesize any of the four target MRI modalities from other available modalities. Our approach not only generates high-fidelity images but also ensures structural coherence across the depth of the volume through a dedicated coherence enhancement mechanism. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on the BraTS-Lighthouse-2025 Challenge dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in synthesizing anatomically plausible and structurally consistent results.

Abstract: Accurate abdominal multi-organ segmentation is critical for clinical applications. Although numerous deep learning-based automatic segmentation methods have been developed, they still struggle to segment small, irregular, or anatomically complex organs. Moreover, most current methods focus on spatial-domain analysis, often overlooking the synergistic potential of frequency-domain representations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework named FMD-TransUNet for precise abdominal multi-organ segmentation. It innovatively integrates the Multi-axis External Weight Block (MEWB) and the improved dual attention module (DA+) into the TransUNet framework. The MEWB extracts multi-axis frequency-domain features to capture both global anatomical structures and local boundary details, providing complementary information to spatial-domain representations. The DA+ block utilizes depthwise separable convolutions and incorporates spatial and channel attention mechanisms to enhance feature fusion, reduce redundant information, and narrow the semantic gap between the encoder and decoder. Experimental validation on the Synapse dataset shows that FMD-TransUNet outperforms other recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average DSC of 81.32\% and a HD of 16.35 mm across eight abdominal organs. Compared to the baseline model, the average DSC increased by 3.84\%, and the average HD decreased by 15.34 mm. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of FMD-TransUNet in improving the accuracy of abdominal multi-organ segmentation.

Abstract: Unsupervised multivariate time series (MTS) representation learning aims to extract compact and informative representations from raw sequences without relying on labels, enabling efficient transfer to diverse downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose Dual-Masked Autoencoder (DMAE), a novel masked time-series modeling framework for unsupervised MTS representation learning. DMAE formulates two complementary pretext tasks: (1) reconstructing masked values based on visible attributes, and (2) estimating latent representations of masked features, guided by a teacher encoder. To further improve representation quality, we introduce a feature-level alignment constraint that encourages the predicted latent representations to align with the teacher's outputs. By jointly optimizing these objectives, DMAE learns temporally coherent and semantically rich representations. Comprehensive evaluations across classification, regression, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves consistent and superior performance over competitive baselines.

Abstract: Diffusion models are now commonly used to solve inverse problems in computational imaging. However, most diffusion-based inverse solvers require complete knowledge of the forward operator to be used. In this work, we introduce a novel probabilistic and robust inverse solver with measurement-conditioned diffusion prior (PRISM) to effectively address blind inverse problems. PRISM offers a technical advancement over current methods by incorporating a powerful measurement-conditioned diffusion model into a theoretically principled posterior sampling scheme. Experiments on blind image deblurring validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating the superior performance of PRISM over state-of-the-art baselines in both image and blur kernel recovery.

<title>DiffusionNFT: Online Diffusion Reinforcement with Forward Process</title>

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been central to post-training language models, but its extension to diffusion models remains challenging due to intractable likelihoods. Recent works discretize the reverse sampling process to enable GRPO-style training, yet they inherit fundamental drawbacks, including solver restrictions, forward-reverse inconsistency, and complicated integration with classifier-free guidance (CFG). We introduce Diffusion Negative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT), a new online RL paradigm that optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching. DiffusionNFT contrasts positive and negative generations to define an implicit policy improvement direction, naturally incorporating reinforcement signals into the supervised learning objective. This formulation enables training with arbitrary black-box solvers, eliminates the need for likelihood estimation, and requires only clean images rather than sampling trajectories for policy optimization. DiffusionNFT is up to $25\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO in head-to-head comparisons, while being CFG-free. For instance, DiffusionNFT improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.98 within 1k steps, while FlowGRPO achieves 0.95 with over 5k steps and additional CFG employment. By leveraging multiple reward models, DiffusionNFT significantly boosts the performance of SD3.5-Medium in every benchmark tested.

<title>Dynamic Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance via Online Feedback</title>

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a cornerstone of text-to-image diffusion models, yet its effectiveness is limited by the use of static guidance scales. This "one-size-fits-all" approach fails to adapt to the diverse requirements of different prompts; moreover, prior solutions like gradient-based correction or fixed heuristic schedules introduce additional complexities and fail to generalize. In this work, we challeng this static paradigm by introducing a framework for dynamic CFG scheduling. Our method leverages online feedback from a suite of general-purpose and specialized small-scale latent-space evaluations, such as CLIP for alignment, a discriminator for fidelity and a human preference reward model, to assess generation quality at each step of the reverse diffusion process. Based on this feedback, we perform a greedy search to select the optimal CFG scale for each timestep, creating a unique guidance schedule tailored to every prompt and sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both small-scale models and the state-of-the-art Imagen 3, showing significant improvements in text alignment, visual quality, text rendering and numerical reasoning. Notably, when compared against the default Imagen 3 baseline, our method achieves up to 53.8% human preference win-rate for overall preference, a figure that increases up to to 55.5% on prompts targeting specific capabilities like text rendering. Our work establishes that the optimal guidance schedule is inherently dynamic and prompt-dependent, and provides an efficient and generalizable framework to achieve it.

Abstract: LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) is a popular XAI framework for unraveling decision-making processes in vision machine-learning models. The technique utilizes image segmentation methods to identify fixed regions for calculating feature importance scores as explanations. Therefore, poor segmentation can weaken the explanation and reduce the importance of segments, ultimately affecting the overall clarity of interpretation. To address these challenges, we introduce the DSEG-LIME (Data-Driven Segmentation LIME) framework, featuring: i) a data-driven segmentation for human-recognized feature generation by foundation model integration, and ii) a user-steered granularity in the hierarchical segmentation procedure through composition. Our findings demonstrate that DSEG outperforms on several XAI metrics on pre-trained ImageNet models and improves the alignment of explanations with human-recognized concepts.

Abstract: Recent studies have noted an intriguing phenomenon termed Neural Collapse, that is, when the neural networks establish the right correlation between feature spaces and the training targets, their last-layer features, together with the classifier weights, will collapse into a stable and symmetric structure. In this paper, we extend the investigation of Neural Collapse to the biased datasets with imbalanced attributes. We observe that models will easily fall into the pitfall of shortcut learning and form a biased, non-collapsed feature space at the early period of training, which is hard to reverse and limits the generalization capability. To tackle the root cause of biased classification, we follow the recent inspiration of prime training, and propose an avoid-shortcut learning framework without additional training complexity. With well-designed shortcut primes based on Neural Collapse structure, the models are encouraged to skip the pursuit of simple shortcuts and naturally capture the intrinsic correlations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method induces better convergence properties during training, and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on both synthetic and real-world biased datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/RachelWolowitz/Navigate-beyond-Shortcuts/tree/main.

<title>A re-calibration method for object detection with multi-modal alignment bias in autonomous driving</title>

Abstract: Multi-modal object detection in autonomous driving has achieved great breakthroughs due to the usage of fusing complementary information from different sensors. The calibration in fusion between sensors such as LiDAR and camera was always supposed to be precise in previous work. However, in reality, calibration matrices are fixed when the vehicles leave the factory, but mechanical vibration, road bumps, and data lags may cause calibration bias. As there is relatively limited research on the impact of calibration on fusion detection performance, multi-sensor detection methods with flexible calibration dependency have remained a key objective. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the sensitivity of the SOTA EPNet++ detection framework and prove that even slight bias on calibration can reduce the performance seriously. To address this vulnerability, we propose a re-calibration model to re-calibrate the misalignment in detection tasks. This model integrates LiDAR point cloud, camera image, and initial calibration matrix as inputs, generating re-calibrated bias through semantic segmentation guidance and a tailored loss function design. The re-calibration model can operate with existing detection algorithms, enhancing both robustness against calibration bias and overall object detection performance. Our approach establishes a foundational methodology for maintaining reliability in multi-modal perception systems under real-world calibration uncertainties.

<title>Assessing invariance to affine transformations in image quality metrics</title>

Abstract: Subjective image quality metrics are usually evaluated according to the correlation with human opinion in databases with distortions that may appear in digital media. However, these oversee affine transformations which may represent better the changes in the images actually happening in natural conditions. Humans can be particularly invariant to these natural transformations, as opposed to the digital ones.
  In this work, we propose a methodology to evaluate any image quality metric by assessing their invariance to affine transformations, specifically: rotation, translation, scaling, and changes in spectral illumination. Here, invariance refers to the fact that certain distances should be neglected if their values are below a threshold. This is what we call invisibility threshold of a metric. Our methodology consists of two elements: (1) the determination of a visibility threshold in a subjective representation common to every metric, and (2) a transduction from the distance values of the metric and this common representation. This common representation is based on subjective ratings of readily available image quality databases. We determine the threshold in such common representation (the first element) using accurate psychophysics. Then, the transduction (the second element) can be trivially fitted for any metric: with the provided threshold extension of the method to any metric is straightforward. We test our methodology with some well-established metrics and find that none of them show human-like invisibility thresholds.
  This means that tuning the models exclusively to predict the visibility of generic distortions may disregard other properties of human vision as for instance invariances or invisibility thresholds. The data and code are publicly available to test other metrics.

Abstract: Reverse engineering 3D computer-aided design (CAD) models from images is an important task for many downstream applications including interactive editing, manufacturing, architecture, robotics, etc. The difficulty of the task lies in vast representational disparities between the CAD output and the image input. CAD models are precise, programmatic constructs that involve sequential operations combining discrete command structure with continuous attributes, making it challenging to learn and optimize in an end-to-end fashion. Concurrently, input images introduce inherent challenges such as photometric variability and sensor noise, complicating the reverse engineering process. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that conditionally factorizes the task into two sub-problems. First, we leverage vision-language foundation models (VLMs), a finetuned Llama3.2, to predict the global discrete base structure with semantic information. Second, we propose TrAssembler that, conditioned on the discrete structure with semantics, predicts the continuous attribute values. To support the training of our TrAssembler, we further constructed an annotated CAD dataset of common objects from ShapeNet. Putting all together, our approach and data demonstrate significant first steps towards CAD-ifying images in the wild. Code and data can be found in https://github.com/qq456cvb/Img2CAD.

Abstract: Accurate fixation depth estimation is essential for applications in extended reality (XR), robotics, and human-computer interaction. However, current methods heavily depend on user-specific calibration, which limits their scalability and usability. We introduce FOVAL, a robust calibration-free approach that combines spatiotemporal sequence modelling via Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with subject-invariant feature engineering and normalisation. Compared to Transformers, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), and CNNs, FOVAL achieves superior performance, particularly in scenarios with limited and noisy gaze data. Evaluations across three benchmark datasets using Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) and cross-dataset validation show a mean absolute error (MAE) of 9.1 cm and strong generalisation without calibration. We further analyse inter-subject variability and domain shifts, providing insight into model robustness and adaptation. FOVAL's scalability and accuracy make it highly suitable for real-world deployment.

<title>Combo: Co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaptation in harmony</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Combo, for harmonious co-speech holistic 3D human motion generation and efficient customizable adaption. In particular, we identify that one fundamental challenge as the multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) nature of the generative model of interest. More concretely, on the input end, the model typically consumes both speech signals and character guidance (e.g., identity and emotion), which not only poses challenge on learning capacity but also hinders further adaptation to varying guidance; on the output end, holistic human motions mainly consist of facial expressions and body movements, which are inherently correlated but non-trivial to coordinate in current data-driven generation process. In response to the above challenge, we propose tailored designs to both ends. For the former, we propose to pre-train on data regarding a fixed identity with neutral emotion, and defer the incorporation of customizable conditions (identity and emotion) to fine-tuning stage, which is boosted by our novel X-Adapter for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. For the latter, we propose a simple yet effective transformer design, DU-Trans, which first divides into two branches to learn individual features of face expression and body movements, and then unites those to learn a joint bi-directional distribution and directly predicts combined coefficients. Evaluated on BEAT2 and SHOW datasets, Combo is highly effective in generating high-quality motions but also efficient in transferring identity and emotion.

Abstract: Accurately segmenting structural cracks at the pixel level remains a major hurdle, as existing methods fail to integrate local textures with pixel dependencies, often leading to fragmented and incomplete predictions. Moreover, their high parameter counts and substantial computational demands hinder practical deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose CrackSCF, a Lightweight Cascaded Fusion Crack Segmentation Network designed to achieve robust crack segmentation with exceptional computational efficiency. We design a lightweight convolutional block (LRDS) to replace all standard convolutions. This approach efficiently captures local patterns while operating with a minimal computational footprint. For a holistic perception of crack structures, a lightweight Long-range Dependency Extractor (LDE) captures global dependencies. These are then intelligently unified with local patterns by our Staircase Cascaded Fusion Module (SCFM), ensuring the final segmentation maps are both seamless in continuity and rich in fine-grained detail. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we created the challenging TUT benchmark dataset and evaluated it alongside five other public datasets. The experimental results show that the CrackSCF method consistently outperforms the existing methods, and it demonstrates greater robustness in dealing with complex background noise. On the TUT dataset, CrackSCF achieved 0.8382 on F1 score and 0.8473 on mIoU, and it only required 4.79M parameters.

Abstract: Transparent and reflective objects, which are common in our everyday lives, present a significant challenge to 3D imaging techniques due to their unique visual and optical properties. Faced with these types of objects, RGB-D cameras fail to capture the real depth value with their accurate spatial information. To address this issue, we propose DITR, a diffusion-based Depth Inpainting framework specifically designed for Transparent and Reflective objects. This network consists of two stages, including a Region Proposal stage and a Depth Inpainting stage. DITR dynamically analyzes the optical and geometric depth loss and inpaints them automatically. Furthermore, comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that DITR is highly effective in depth inpainting tasks of transparent and reflective objects with robust adaptability.

Abstract: Recent literature has effectively leveraged diffusion models trained on continuous variables as priors for solving inverse problems. Notably, discrete diffusion models with discrete latent codes have shown strong performance, particularly in modalities suited for discrete compressed representations, such as image and motion generation. However, their discrete and non-differentiable nature has limited their application to inverse problems formulated in continuous spaces. This paper presents a novel method for addressing linear inverse problems by leveraging generative models based on discrete diffusion as priors. We overcome these limitations by approximating the true posterior distribution with a variational distribution constructed from categorical distributions and continuous relaxation techniques. Furthermore, we employ a star-shaped noise process to mitigate the drawbacks of traditional discrete diffusion models with absorbing states, demonstrating that our method performs comparably to continuous diffusion techniques with a lower GPU memory consumption. Our code is available at https://github.com/sony/g2d2.

Abstract: In recent decades, chemistry publications and patents have increased rapidly. A significant portion of key information is embedded in molecular structure figures, complicating large-scale literature searches and limiting the application of large language models in fields such as biology, chemistry, and pharmaceuticals. The automatic extraction of precise chemical structures is of critical importance. However, the presence of numerous Markush structures in real-world documents, along with variations in molecular image quality, drawing styles, and noise, significantly limits the performance of existing optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) methods. We present MolParser, a novel end-to-end OCSR method that efficiently and accurately recognizes chemical structures from real-world documents, including difficult Markush structure. We use a extended SMILES encoding rule to annotate our training dataset. Under this rule, we build MolParser-7M, the largest annotated molecular image dataset to our knowledge. While utilizing a large amount of synthetic data, we employed active learning methods to incorporate substantial in-the-wild data, specifically samples cropped from real patents and scientific literature, into the training process. We trained an end-to-end molecular image captioning model, MolParser, using a curriculum learning approach. MolParser significantly outperforms classical and learning-based methods across most scenarios, with potential for broader downstream applications. The dataset is publicly available in huggingface.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce CADSpotting, an effective method for panoptic symbol spotting in large-scale architectural CAD drawings. Existing approaches often struggle with symbol diversity, scale variations, and overlapping elements in CAD designs, and typically rely on additional features (e.g., primitive types or graphical layers) to improve performance. CADSpotting overcomes these challenges by representing primitives through densely sampled points with only coordinate attributes, using a unified 3D point cloud model for robust feature learning. To enable accurate segmentation in large drawings, we further propose a novel Sliding Window Aggregation (SWA) technique that combines weighted voting and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS). Moreover, we introduce LS-CAD, a new large-scale dataset comprising 45 finely annotated floorplans, each covering approximately 1,000 $m^2$, significantly larger than prior benchmarks. LS-CAD will be publicly released to support future research. Experiments on FloorPlanCAD and LS-CAD demonstrate that CADSpotting significantly outperforms existing methods. We also showcase its practical value by enabling automated parametric 3D interior reconstruction directly from raw CAD inputs.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems typically assume static, distant illumination; however, many real-world scenarios, such as endoscopy, subterranean robotics, and search & rescue in collapsed environments, require agents to operate with a co-located light and camera in the absence of external lighting. In such cases, dynamic near-field lighting introduces strong, view-dependent shading that significantly degrades SLAM performance. We introduce Near-Field Lighting Bundle Adjustment Loss (NFL-BA) which explicitly models near-field lighting as a part of Bundle Adjustment loss and enables better performance for scenes captured with dynamic lighting. NFL-BA can be integrated into neural rendering-based SLAM systems with implicit or explicit scene representations. Our evaluations mainly focus on endoscopy procedure where SLAM can enable autonomous navigation, guidance to unsurveyed regions, blindspot detections, and 3D visualizations, which can significantly improve patient outcomes and endoscopy experience for both physicians and patients. Replacing Photometric Bundle Adjustment loss of SLAM systems with NFL-BA leads to significant improvement in camera tracking, 37% for MonoGS and 14% for EndoGS, and leads to state-of-the-art camera tracking and mapping performance on the C3VD colonoscopy dataset. Further evaluation on indoor scenes captured with phone camera with flashlight turned on, also demonstrate significant improvement in SLAM performance due to NFL-BA.

Abstract: Current methods for searching brain MR images rely on text-based approaches, highlighting a significant need for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems. Directly applying 3D brain MR images to machine learning models offers the benefit of effectively learning the brain's structure; however, building the generalized model necessitates a large amount of training data. While models that consider depth direction and utilize continuous 2D slices have demonstrated success in segmentation and classification tasks involving 3D data, concerns remain. Specifically, using general 2D slices may lead to the oversight of pathological features and discontinuities in depth direction information. Furthermore, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there have been no attempts to develop a practical CBIR system that preserves the entire brain's structural information. In this study, we propose an interpretable CBIR method for brain MR images, named iCBIR-Sli (Interpretable CBIR with 2D Slice Embedding), which, for the first time globally, utilizes a series of 2D slices. iCBIR-Sli addresses the challenges associated with using 2D slices by effectively aggregating slice information, thereby achieving low-dimensional representations with high completeness, usability, robustness, and interoperability, which are qualities essential for effective CBIR. In retrieval evaluation experiments utilizing five publicly available brain MR datasets (ADNI2/3, OASIS3/4, AIBL) for Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal, iCBIR-Sli demonstrated top-1 retrieval performance (macro F1 = 0.859), comparable to existing deep learning models explicitly designed for classification, without the need for an external classifier. Additionally, the method provided high interpretability by clearly identifying the brain regions indicative of the searched-for disease.

Abstract: Understanding emotional signals in older adults is crucial for designing virtual assistants that support their well-being. However, existing affective computing models often face significant limitations: (1) limited availability of datasets representing older adults, especially in non-English-speaking populations, and (2) poor generalization of models trained on younger or homogeneous demographics. To address these gaps, this study evaluates state-of-the-art affective computing models -- including facial expression recognition, text sentiment analysis, and smile detection -- using videos of older adults interacting with either a person or a virtual avatar. As part of this effort, we introduce a novel dataset featuring Spanish-speaking older adults engaged in human-to-human video interviews. Through three comprehensive analyses, we investigate (1) the alignment between human-annotated labels and automatic model outputs, (2) the relationships between model outputs across different modalities, and (3) individual variations in emotional signals. Using both the Wizard of Oz (WoZ) dataset and our newly collected dataset, we uncover limited agreement between human annotations and model predictions, weak consistency across modalities, and significant variability among individuals. These findings highlight the shortcomings of generalized emotion perception models and emphasize the need of incorporating personal variability and cultural nuances into future systems.

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, achieving domain adaptation and generalization poses significant challenges, as models must adapt to or generalize across unknown target distributions. Extending these capabilities to unseen multimodal distributions, i.e., multimodal domain adaptation and generalization, is even more challenging due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities. Significant progress has been made over the years, with applications ranging from action recognition to semantic segmentation. Besides, the recent advent of large-scale pre-trained multimodal foundation models, such as CLIP, has inspired works leveraging these models to enhance adaptation and generalization performances or adapting them to downstream tasks. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of recent advances from traditional approaches to foundation models, covering: (1) Multimodal domain adaptation; (2) Multimodal test-time adaptation; (3) Multimodal domain generalization; (4) Domain adaptation and generalization with the help of multimodal foundation models; and (5) Adaptation of multimodal foundation models. For each topic, we formally define the problem and thoroughly review existing methods. Additionally, we analyze relevant datasets and applications, highlighting open challenges and potential future research directions. We maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature at https://github.com/donghao51/Awesome-Multimodal-Adaptation.

Abstract: Accurate detection of all pathological findings in 3D medical images remains a significant challenge, as supervised models are limited to detecting only the few pathology classes annotated in existing datasets. To address this, we frame pathology detection as an unsupervised visual anomaly segmentation (UVAS) problem, leveraging the inherent rarity of pathological patterns compared to healthy ones. We enhance the existing density-based UVAS framework with two key innovations: (1) dense self-supervised learning for feature extraction, eliminating the need for supervised pretraining, and (2) learned, masking-invariant dense features as conditioning variables, replacing hand-crafted positional encodings. Trained on over 30,000 unlabeled 3D CT volumes, our fully self-supervised model, Screener, outperforms existing UVAS methods on four large-scale test datasets comprising 1,820 scans with diverse pathologies. Furthermore, in a supervised fine-tuning setting, Screener surpasses existing self-supervised pretraining methods, establishing it as a state-of-the-art foundation for pathology segmentation. The code and pretrained models will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Extreme heat events, exacerbated by climate change, pose significant challenges to urban resilience and planning. This study introduces a climate-responsive digital twin framework integrating the Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer (ST-ViT) model to enhance heat stress forecasting and decision-making. Using a Texas campus as a testbed, we synthesized high-resolution physical model simulations with spatial and meteorological data to develop fine-scale human thermal predictions. The ST-ViT-powered digital twin enables efficient, data-driven insights for planners and stakeholders, supporting targeted heat mitigation strategies and advancing climate-adaptive urban design. This campus-scale demonstration offers a foundation for future applications across broader and more diverse urban contexts.

<title>SCoT: Straight Consistent Trajectory for Pre-Trained Diffusion Model Distillations</title>

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models are commonly used to generate clean data (e.g., images) from random noises, effectively forming pairs of noises and corresponding clean images. Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated great potential in interpreting remote sensing (RS) images through language-guided semantic. However, the effectiveness of these VLMs critically depends on high-quality image-text training data that captures rich semantic relationships between visual content and language descriptions. Unlike natural images, RS lacks large-scale interleaved image-text pairs from web data, making data collection challenging. While current approaches rely primarily on rule-based methods or flagship VLMs for data synthesis, a systematic framework for automated quality assessment of such synthetically generated RS vision-language data is notably absent. To fill this gap, we propose a novel score model trained on large-scale RS vision-language preference data for automated quality assessment. Our empirical results demonstrate that fine-tuning CLIP or advanced VLMs (e.g., Qwen2-VL) with the top 30% of data ranked by our score model achieves superior accuracy compared to both full-data fine-tuning and CLIP-score-based ranking approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate applications of our scoring model for reinforcement learning (RL) training and best-of-N (BoN) test-time scaling, enabling significant improvements in VLM performance for RS tasks. Our code, model, and dataset are publicly available

Abstract: Automatic visual inspection using machine learning plays a key role in achieving zero-defect policies in industry. Research on anomaly detection is constrained by the availability of datasets that capture complex defect appearances and imperfect imaging conditions, which are typical of production processes. Recent benchmarks indicate that most publicly available datasets are biased towards optimal imaging conditions, leading to an overestimation of their applicability in real-world industrial scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce the Industrial Screen Printing Anomaly Detection Dataset (ISP-AD). It presents challenging small and weakly contrasted surface defects embedded within structured patterns exhibiting high permitted design variability. To the best of our knowledge, it is the largest publicly available industrial dataset to date, including both synthetic and real defects collected directly from the factory floor. Beyond benchmarking recent unsupervised anomaly detection methods, experiments on a mixed supervised training strategy, incorporating both synthesized and real defects, were conducted. Experiments show that even a small amount of injected, weakly labeled real defects improves generalization. Furthermore, starting from training on purely synthetic defects, emerging real defective samples can be efficiently integrated into subsequent scalable training. Overall, our findings indicate that model-free synthetic defects can provide a cold-start baseline, whereas a small number of injected real defects refine the decision boundary for previously unseen defect characteristics. The presented unsupervised and supervised dataset splits are designed to emphasize research on unsupervised, self-supervised, and supervised approaches, enhancing their applicability to industrial settings.

<title>Pruning the Paradox: How CLIP's Most Informative Heads Enhance Performance While Amplifying Bias</title>

Abstract: CLIP is one of the most popular foundation models and is heavily used for many vision-language tasks, yet little is known about its inner workings. As CLIP is increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it is becoming even more critical to understand its limitations and embedded social biases to mitigate potentially harmful downstream consequences. However, the question of what internal mechanisms drive both the impressive capabilities as well as problematic shortcomings of CLIP has largely remained unanswered. To bridge this gap, we study the conceptual consistency of text descriptions for attention heads in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we propose Concept Consistency Score (CCS), a novel interpretability metric that measures how consistently individual attention heads in CLIP models align with specific concepts. Our soft-pruning experiments reveal that high CCS heads are critical for preserving model performance, as pruning them leads to a significantly larger performance drop than pruning random or low CCS heads. Notably, we find that high CCS heads capture essential concepts and play a key role in out-of-domain detection, concept-specific reasoning, and video-language understanding. Moreover, we prove that high CCS heads learn spurious correlations which amplify social biases. These results position CCS as a powerful interpretability metric exposing the paradox of performance and social biases in CLIP models.

<title>Think or Not Think: A Study of Explicit Thinking in Rule-Based Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the role of explicit thinking process in rule-based reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) for MLLMs. We first propose CLS-RL for MLLM image classification, using verifiable rewards for fine-tuning. Experiments show CLS-RL significantly outperforms SFT and yields a cross-dataset generalization effect. We then rethink and question whether explicit thinking in RFT is always necessary. Challenging the convention that explicit thinking is crucial for the success of RFT, we introduce No-Thinking-RL, exploring RFT without thinking by introducing a simple equality accuracy reward. We evaluate No-Thinking-RL on 6 diverse tasks across different model sizes and types. Experimental results reveal three key findings: 1). Visual perception tasks do not require thinking during RFT, as No-Thinking-RL consistently outperforms or matches Thinking-based RFT across model sizes. 2).} Models with limited capabilities struggle to generate high-quality CoT for RFT, making Thinking-based RFT less effective than No-Thinking-RL. 3). There are inconsistencies between the answers in the thinking and answer tags for some responses of thinking-based RFT, which show lower accuracy than the overall accuracy. We hypothesize that explicit thinking before verifiable answers may hinder reward convergence and reduce performance. To test this hypothesis, we propose Think-After-Answer, which places thinking after the answer to mitigate this effect for experimental verification. Lastly, we conduct a pilot study to explore whether MLLMs can learn when to think during RFT, introducing an Adaptive-Thinking method. Experiments show that it converges to a specific prompt depending on model capability and task complexity, achieving comparable or better performance than both Thinking and No-Thinking-RL. This suggests MLLMs can adaptively decide to think or not based on their capabilities and task complexity.

Abstract: The increasing number of autonomous vehicles and the rapid development of computer vision technologies underscore the particular importance of conducting research on the accuracy of traffic sign recognition. Numerous studies in this field have already achieved significant results, demonstrating high effectiveness in addressing traffic sign recognition tasks. However, the task becomes considerably more complex when a sign is partially obscured by surrounding objects, such as tree branches, billboards, or other elements of the urban environment. In our study, we investigated how partial occlusion of traffic signs affects their recognition. For this purpose, we collected a dataset comprising 5,746 images, including both fully visible and partially occluded signs, and made it publicly available. Using this dataset, we compared the performance of our custom convolutional neural network (CNN), which achieved 96% accuracy, with models trained using transfer learning. The best result was obtained by VGG16 with full layer unfreezing, reaching 99% accuracy. Additional experiments revealed that models trained solely on fully visible signs lose effectiveness when recognizing occluded signs. This highlights the critical importance of incorporating real-world data with partial occlusion into training sets to ensure robust model performance in complex practical scenarios and to enhance the safety of autonomous driving.

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy, while being a key driver for progress in the life sciences, is also subject to technical limitations. To overcome them, computational multiplexing techniques have recently been proposed, which allow multiple cellular structures to be captured in a single image and later be unmixed. Existing image decomposition methods are trained on a set of superimposed input images and the respective unmixed target images. It is critical to note that the relative strength (mixing ratio) of the superimposed images for a given input is a priori unknown. However, existing methods are trained on a fixed intensity ratio of superimposed inputs, making them not cognizant to the range of relative intensities that can occur in fluorescence microscopy. In this work, we propose a novel method called indiSplit that is cognizant of the severity of the above mentioned mixing ratio. Our idea is based on InDI, a popular iterative method for image restoration, and an ideal starting point to embrace the unknown mixing ratio in any given input. We introduce (i) a suitably trained regressor network that predicts the degradation level (mixing asymmetry) of a given input image and (ii) a degradation-specific normalization module, enabling degradation-aware inference across all mixing ratios. We show that this method solves two relevant tasks in fluorescence microscopy, namely image splitting and bleedthrough removal, and empirically demonstrate the applicability of indiSplit on $5$ public datasets. We will release all sources under a permissive license.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks in natural language processing, computer vision, and speech processing. However, their immense capacity often leads to overfitting, especially when training data is limited or noisy. In this research, a unified family of stochastic regularization techniques has been proposed, i.e. AttentionDrop with its three different variants, which operate directly on the self-attention distributions. Hard Attention Masking randomly zeroes out top-k attention logits per query to encourage diverse context utilization, Blurred Attention Smoothing applies a dynamic Gaussian convolution over attention logits to diffuse overly peaked distributions, and Consistency-Regularized AttentionDrop enforces output stability under multiple independent AttentionDrop perturbations via a KL-based consistency loss. Results achieved in the study demonstrate that AttentionDrop consistently improves accuracy, calibration, and adversarial robustness over standard Dropout, DropConnect, and R-Drop baselines

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of mobile imaging, capturing screens using smartphones has become a prevalent practice in distance learning and conference recording. However, moir\'e artifacts, caused by frequency aliasing between display screens and camera sensors, are further amplified by the image signal processing pipeline, leading to severe visual degradation. Existing sRGB domain demoir\'eing methods struggle with irreversible information loss, while recent two-stage raw domain approaches suffer from information bottlenecks and inference inefficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a single-stage raw domain demoir\'eing framework, Dual-Stream Demoir\'eing Network (DSDNet), which leverages the synergy of raw and YCbCr images to remove moir\'e while preserving luminance and color fidelity. Specifically, to guide luminance correction and moir\'e removal, we design a raw-to-YCbCr mapping pipeline and introduce the Synergic Attention with Dynamic Modulation (SADM) module. This module enriches the raw-to-sRGB conversion with cross-domain contextual features. Furthermore, to better guide color fidelity, we develop a Luminance-Chrominance Adaptive Transformer (LCAT), which decouples luminance and chrominance representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSDNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and quantitative evaluation and achieves an inference speed $\mathrm{\textbf{2.4x}}$ faster than the second-best method, highlighting its practical advantages. We provide an anonymous online demo at https://xxxxxxxxdsdnet.github.io/DSDNet/.

Abstract: We present StreamBridge, a simple yet effective framework that seamlessly transforms offline Video-LLMs into streaming-capable models. It addresses two fundamental challenges in adapting existing models into online scenarios: (1) limited capability for multi-turn real-time understanding, and (2) lack of proactive response mechanisms. Specifically, StreamBridge incorporates (1) a memory buffer combined with a round-decayed compression strategy, supporting long-context multi-turn interactions, and (2) a decoupled, lightweight activation model that can be effortlessly integrated into existing Video-LLMs, enabling continuous proactive responses. To further support StreamBridge, we construct Stream-IT, a large-scale dataset tailored for streaming video understanding, featuring interleaved video-text sequences and diverse instruction formats. Extensive experiments show that StreamBridge significantly improves the streaming understanding capabilities of offline Video-LLMs across various tasks, outperforming even proprietary models such as GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro. Simultaneously, it achieves competitive or superior performance on standard video understanding benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal learning is an emerging research topic across multiple disciplines but has rarely been applied to planetary science. In this contribution, we propose a single, unified transformer architecture trained to learn shared representations between multiple sources like grayscale images, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), surface normals, and albedo maps. The architecture supports flexible translation from any input modality to any target modality. Our results demonstrate that our foundation model learns physically plausible relations across these four modalities. We further identify that image-based 3D reconstruction and albedo estimation (Shape and Albedo from Shading) of lunar images can be formulated as a multimodal learning problem. Our results demonstrate the potential of multimodal learning to solve Shape and Albedo from Shading and provide a new approach for large-scale planetary 3D reconstruction. Adding more input modalities in the future will further improve the results and enable tasks such as photometric normalization and co-registration.

Abstract: Medical disease prediction, particularly through imaging, remains a challenging task due to the complexity and variability of medical data, including noise, ambiguity, and differing image quality. Recent deep learning models, including Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods, have shown promising results in brain tumor image identification but still face limitations in handling uncertainty and generalizing across diverse medical conditions. Traditional KD methods often rely on a context-unaware temperature parameter to soften teacher model predictions, which does not adapt effectively to varying uncertainty levels present in medical images. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework that integrates Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for optimal teacher-student model selection and a novel context-aware predictor approach for temperature scaling. The proposed context-aware framework adjusts the temperature based on factors such as image quality, disease complexity, and teacher model confidence, allowing for more robust knowledge transfer. Additionally, ACO efficiently selects the most appropriate teacher-student model pair from a set of pre-trained models, outperforming current optimization methods by exploring a broader solution space and better handling complex, non-linear relationships within the data. The proposed framework is evaluated using three publicly available benchmark datasets, each corresponding to a distinct medical imaging task. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving top accuracy rates: 98.01% on the MRI brain tumor (Kaggle) dataset, 92.81% on the Figshare MRI dataset, and 96.20% on the GastroNet dataset. This enhanced performance is further evidenced by the improved results, surpassing existing benchmarks of 97.24% (Kaggle), 91.43% (Figshare), and 95.00% (GastroNet).

Abstract: The emergence and popularity of facial deepfake methods spur the vigorous development of deepfake datasets and facial forgery detection, which to some extent alleviates the security concerns about facial-related artificial intelligence technologies. However, when it comes to human body forgery, there has been a persistent lack of datasets and detection methods, due to the later inception and complexity of human body generation methods. To mitigate this issue, we introduce TikTok-DeepFake (TT-DF), a novel large-scale diffusion-based dataset containing 6,120 forged videos with 1,378,857 synthetic frames, specifically tailored for body forgery detection. TT-DF offers a wide variety of forgery methods, involving multiple advanced human image animation models utilized for manipulation, two generative configurations based on the disentanglement of identity and pose information, as well as different compressed versions. The aim is to simulate any potential unseen forged data in the wild as comprehensively as possible, and we also furnish a benchmark on TT-DF. Additionally, we propose an adapted body forgery detection model, Temporal Optical Flow Network (TOF-Net), which exploits the spatiotemporal inconsistencies and optical flow distribution differences between natural data and forged data. Our experiments demonstrate that TOF-Net achieves favorable performance on TT-DF, outperforming current state-of-the-art extendable facial forgery detection models.

Abstract: Background: There are many challenges and opportunities in the clinical deployment of AI tools in radiology. The current study describes a radiology software platform called NeoMedSys that can enable efficient deployment and refinements of AI models. We evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of running NeoMedSys for three months in real-world clinical settings and focused on improvement performance of an in-house developed AI model (VIOLA-AI) designed for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) detection.
  Methods: NeoMedSys integrates tools for deploying, testing, and optimizing AI models with a web-based medical image viewer, annotation system, and hospital-wide radiology information systems. A prospective pragmatic investigation was deployed using clinical cases of patients presenting to the largest Emergency Department in Norway (site-1) with suspected traumatic brain injury (TBI) or patients with suspected stroke (site-2). We assessed ICH classification performance as VIOLA-AI encountered new data and underwent pre-planned model retraining. Performance metrics included sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
  Results: NeoMedSys facilitated iterative improvements in the AI model, significantly enhancing its diagnostic accuracy. Automated bleed detection and segmentation were reviewed in near real-time to facilitate re-training VIOLA-AI. The iterative refinement process yielded a marked improvement in classification sensitivity, rising to 90.3% (from 79.2%), and specificity that reached 89.3% (from 80.7%). The bleed detection ROC analysis for the entire sample demonstrated a high area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.949 (from 0.873). Model refinement stages were associated with notable gains, highlighting the value of real-time radiologist feedback.

Abstract: Accurate detection of road and bridge changes is crucial for urban planning and transportation management, yet presents unique challenges for general change detection (CD). Key difficulties arise from maintaining the continuity of roads and bridges as linear structures and disambiguating visually similar land covers (e.g., road construction vs. bare land). Existing spatial-domain models struggle with these issues, further hindered by the lack of specialized, semantically rich datasets. To fill these gaps, we introduce the Road and Bridge Semantic Change Detection (RB-SCD) dataset. As the first benchmark to systematically target semantic change detection of roads and bridges, RB-SCD offers comprehensive fine-grained annotations for 11 semantic change categories. This enables a detailed analysis of traffic infrastructure evolution. Building on this, we propose a novel framework, the Multimodal Frequency-Driven Change Detector (MFDCD). MFDCD integrates multimodal features in the frequency domain through two key components: (1) the Dynamic Frequency Coupler (DFC), which leverages wavelet transform to decompose visual features, enabling it to robustly model the continuity of linear transitions; and (2) the Textual Frequency Filter (TFF), which encodes semantic priors into frequency-domain graphs and applies filter banks to align them with visual features, resolving semantic ambiguities. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of MFDCD on RB-SCD and three public CD datasets. The code will be available at https://github.com/DaGuangDaGuang/RB-SCD.

Abstract: Tactile perception is profoundly influenced by the surface properties of objects in contact. However, despite their crucial role in shaping tactile experiences, these material characteristics have been largely neglected in existing tactile representation learning methods. Most approaches primarily focus on aligning tactile data with visual or textual information, overlooking the richness of tactile feedback that comes from understanding the materials' inherent properties. In this work, we address this gap by revisiting the tactile representation learning framework and incorporating material-aware priors into the learning process. These priors, which represent pre-learned characteristics specific to different materials, allow tactile models to better capture and generalize the nuances of surface texture. Our method enables more accurate, contextually rich tactile feedback across diverse materials and textures, improving performance in real-world applications such as robotics, haptic feedback systems, and material editing.

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in visual reasoning tasks. However, geo-localization presents unique challenges, requiring the extraction of multigranular visual cues from images and their integration with external world knowledge for systematic reasoning. Current approaches to geo-localization tasks often lack robust reasoning mechanisms and explainability, limiting their effectiveness. To address these limitations, we propose the Geo Reason Enhancement (GRE) Suite, a novel framework that augments VLMs with structured reasoning chains for accurate and interpretable location inference. The GRE Suite is systematically developed across three key dimensions: dataset, model, and benchmark. First, we introduce GRE30K, a high-quality geo-localization reasoning dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained visual and contextual analysis. Next, we present the GRE model, which employs a multi-stage reasoning strategy to progressively infer scene attributes, local details, and semantic features, thereby narrowing down potential geographic regions with enhanced precision. Finally, we construct the Geo Reason Evaluation Benchmark (GREval-Bench), a comprehensive evaluation framework that assesses VLMs across diverse urban, natural, and landmark scenes to measure both coarse-grained (e.g., country, continent) and fine-grained (e.g., city, street) localization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that GRE significantly outperforms existing methods across all granularities of geo-localization tasks, underscoring the efficacy of reasoning-augmented VLMs in complex geographic inference. Code and data will be released at https://github.com/Thorin215/GRE.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a central role in engineering and manufacturing, making it possible to create precise and editable 3D models. Using a variety of sensor or user-provided data as inputs for CAD reconstruction can democratize access to design applications. However, existing methods typically focus on a single input modality, such as point clouds, images, or text, which limits their generalizability and robustness. Leveraging recent advances in vision-language models (VLM), we propose a multi-modal CAD reconstruction model that simultaneously processes all three input modalities. Inspired by large language model (LLM) training paradigms, we adopt a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on large-scale procedurally generated data, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning using online feedback, obtained programatically. Furthermore, we are the first to explore RL fine-tuning of LLMs for CAD tasks demonstrating that online RL algorithms such as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) outperform offline alternatives. In the DeepCAD benchmark, our SFT model outperforms existing single-modal approaches in all three input modalities simultaneously. More importantly, after RL fine-tuning, cadrille sets new state-of-the-art on three challenging datasets, including a real-world one.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled models to perform both understanding and generation of multimodal data in a unified manner. However, achieving a fine-grained alignment between input prompts and generated images remains a major challenge especially in text-to-image generation. Therefore, recent works have introduced self-improving mechanisms based on self-generated data and self-feedback to efficiently mitigate this challenge without relying on external large-scale data or models. However, existing self-improving approaches have not focused on fine-grained visual details especially at the object level in generating training data or providing a feedback, and thus they still struggle to resolve the object hallucination problem in text-to-image generation. To tackle this problem, we propose an Object-centric Self-improving Preference Optimization (OSPO), a self-improving framework for enhancing object-level text-image alignment. OSPO is designed to explicitly address the need for constructing and leveraging object-level hard negative data and an object-centric optimization in improving object-specific fidelity. In specific, OSPO consists of: (1) Initial Prompt Generation (2) Hard Preference Pair Generation (3) Filtering and Selection (4) Object-centric Preference Optimization with Conditional Preference Loss. Extensive experiments on compositional image generation benchmarks demonstrate that OSPO significantly improves fine-grained alignment in text-to-image generation, surpassing not only prior self-improving methods but also diffusion-based specialized image generation models.

Abstract: Visual-spatial understanding, the ability to infer object relationships and layouts from visual input, is fundamental to downstream tasks such as robotic navigation and embodied interaction. However, existing methods face spatial uncertainty and data scarcity, limiting the 3D spatial reasoning capability of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for enhancing 3D spatial reasoning in pre-trained VLMs without modifying their architecture. This framework combines SpatialMind, a structured prompting strategy that decomposes complex scenes and questions into interpretable reasoning steps, with ScanForgeQA, a scalable question-answering dataset built from diverse 3D simulation scenes through an automated construction process designed for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the individual and combined effectiveness of our prompting and fine-tuning strategies, and yield insights that may inspire future research on visual-spatial understanding.

<title>LLMs Can Compensate for Deficiencies in Visual Representations</title>

Abstract: Many vision-language models (VLMs) that prove very effective at a range of multimodal task, build on CLIP-based vision encoders, which are known to have various limitations. We investigate the hypothesis that the strong language backbone in VLMs compensates for possibly weak visual features by contextualizing or enriching them. Using three CLIP-based VLMs, we perform controlled self-attention ablations on a carefully designed probing task. Our findings show that despite known limitations, CLIP visual representations offer ready-to-read semantic information to the language decoder. However, in scenarios of reduced contextualization in the visual representations, the language decoder can largely compensate for the deficiency and recover performance. This suggests a dynamic division of labor in VLMs and motivates future architectures that offload more visual processing to the language decoder.

Abstract: Automatic indoor layout generation has attracted increasing attention due to its potential in interior design, virtual environment construction, and embodied AI. Existing methods fall into two categories: prompt-driven approaches that leverage proprietary LLM services (e.g., GPT APIs) and learning-based methods trained on layout data upon diffusion-based models. Prompt-driven methods often suffer from spatial inconsistency and high computational costs, while learning-based methods are typically constrained by coarse relational graphs and limited datasets, restricting their generalization to diverse room categories. In this paper, we revisit LLM-based indoor layout generation and present 3D-SynthPlace, a large-scale dataset that combines synthetic layouts generated via a 'GPT synthesize, Human inspect' pipeline, upgraded from the 3D-Front dataset. 3D-SynthPlace contains nearly 17,000 scenes, covering four common room types -- bedroom, living room, kitchen, and bathroom -- enriched with diverse objects and high-level spatial annotations. We further introduce OptiScene, a strong open-source LLM optimized for indoor layout generation, fine-tuned based on our 3D-SynthPlace dataset through our two-stage training. For the warum-up stage I, we adopt supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is taught to first generate high-level spatial descriptions then conditionally predict concrete object placements. For the reinforcing stage II, to better align the generated layouts with human design preferences, we apply multi-turn direct preference optimization (DPO), which significantly improving layout quality and generation success rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OptiScene outperforms traditional prompt-driven and learning-based baselines. Moreover, OptiScene shows promising potential in interactive tasks such as scene editing and robot navigation.

Abstract: Model editing aims to efficiently update a pre-trained model's knowledge without the need for time-consuming full retraining. While existing pioneering editing methods achieve promising results, they primarily focus on editing single-modal language models (LLMs). However, for vision-language models (VLMs), which involve multiple modalities, the role and impact of each modality on editing performance remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we explore the impact of textual and visual modalities on model editing and find that: (1) textual and visual representations reach peak sensitivity at different layers, reflecting their varying importance; and (2) editing both modalities can efficiently update knowledge, but this comes at the cost of compromising the model's original capabilities. Based on our findings, we propose DualEdit, an editor that modifies both textual and visual modalities at their respective key layers. Additionally, we introduce a gating module within the more sensitive textual modality, allowing DualEdit to efficiently update new knowledge while preserving the model's original information. We evaluate DualEdit across multiple VLM backbones and benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art VLM editing baselines as well as adapted LLM editing methods on different evaluation metrics.

Abstract: This research paper proposes an improved deep learning model for classifying tents in street bazaars, comparing a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with EfficientNetB0. This is a critical task for market organization with a tent classification, but manual methods in the past have been inefficient. Street bazaars represent a vital economic hub in many regions, yet their unstructured nature poses significant challenges for the automated classification of market infrastructure, such as tents. In Kyrgyzstan, more than a quarter of the country's GDP is derived from bazaars. While CNNs have been widely applied to object recognition, their application to bazaar-specific tasks remains underexplored. Here, we build upon our original approach by training on an extended set of 126 original photographs that were augmented to generate additional images. This dataset is publicly available for download on Kaggle. A variety of performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP), were used to assess the models comparatively, providing a more extensive analysis of classification performance.
  The results show that the CNN custom model achieved 92.8% accuracy, and EfficientNetB0 showed 98.4% accuracy results, confirming the effectiveness of transfer learning in the bazaar image classification. Also, when analyzing the confusion matrix, the analysis reveals the weaknesses and strengths of each model. These findings suggest that using a pre-trained model such as EfficientNetB0 significantly improves classification accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to generate personalized image captions, even when trained on high-quality captions. In this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging multi-concept image captioning task.

Abstract: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and failure prediction remain open challenges for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We introduce ViLU, a new Vision-Language Uncertainty quantification framework that contextualizes uncertainty estimates by leveraging all task-relevant textual representations. ViLU constructs an uncertainty-aware multi-modal representation by integrating the visual embedding, the predicted textual embedding, and an image-conditioned textual representation via cross-attention. Unlike traditional UQ methods based on loss prediction, ViLU trains an uncertainty predictor as a binary classifier to distinguish correct from incorrect predictions using a weighted binary cross-entropy loss, making it loss-agnostic. In particular, our proposed approach is well-suited for post-hoc settings, where only vision and text embeddings are available without direct access to the model itself. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets show the significant gains of our method compared to state-of-the-art failure prediction methods. We apply our method to standard classification datasets, such as ImageNet-1k, as well as large-scale image-caption datasets like CC12M and LAION-400M. Ablation studies highlight the critical role of our architecture and training in achieving effective uncertainty quantification. Our code is publicly available and can be found here: https://github.com/ykrmm/ViLU.

<title>Cross-Resolution SAR Target Detection Using Structural Hierarchy Adaptation and Reliable Adjacency Alignment</title>

Abstract: In recent years, continuous improvements in SAR resolution have significantly benefited applications such as urban monitoring and target detection. However, the improvement in resolution leads to increased discrepancies in scattering characteristics, posing challenges to the generalization ability of target detection models. While domain adaptation technology is a potential solution, the inevitable discrepancies caused by resolution differences often lead to blind feature adaptation and unreliable semantic propagation, ultimately degrading the domain adaptation performance. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel SAR target detection method (termed CR-Net), that incorporates structure priors and evidential learning theory into the detection model, enabling reliable domain adaptation for cross-resolution detection. To be specific, CR-Net integrates Structure-induced Hierarchical Feature Adaptation (SHFA) and Reliable Structural Adjacency Alignment (RSAA). SHFA module is introduced to establish structural correlations between targets and achieve structure-aware feature adaptation, thereby enhancing the interpretability of the feature adaptation process. Afterwards, the RSAA module is proposed to enhance reliable semantic alignment, by leveraging the secure adjacency set to transfer valuable discriminative knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. This further improves the discriminability of the detection model in the target domain. Based on experimental results from different-resolution datasets,the proposed CR-Net significantly enhances cross-resolution adaptation by preserving intra-domain structures and improving discriminability. It achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in cross-resolution SAR target detection.

Abstract: Reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) from RGB inputs provides a cost-effective alternative to hyperspectral cameras, but reconstructing high-dimensional spectra from three channels is inherently ill-posed. Existing methods typically directly regress RGB-to-HSI mappings using large attention networks, which are computationally expensive and handle ill-posedness only implicitly. We propose MCGA, a Mixture-of-Codebooks with Grayscale-aware Attention framework that explicitly addresses these challenges using spectral priors and photometric consistency. MCGA first learns transferable spectral priors via a mixture-of-codebooks (MoC) from heterogeneous HSI datasets, then aligns RGB features with these priors through grayscale-aware photometric attention (GANet). Efficiency and robustness are further improved via top-K attention design and test-time adaptation (TTA). Experiments on benchmarks and real-world data demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy, strong cross-dataset generalization, and 4-5x faster inference. Codes will be available once acceptance at https://github.com/Fibonaccirabbit/MCGA.

Abstract: Traffic prediction is a critical component of intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion mitigation and accident risk prediction. While recent research has explored both graph-based and grid-based approaches, key limitations remain. Graph-based methods effectively capture non-Euclidean spatial structures but often incur high computational overhead, limiting their practicality in large-scale systems. In contrast, grid-based methods, which primarily leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), offer greater computational efficiency but struggle to model irregular spatial patterns due to the fixed shape of their filters. Moreover, both approaches often fail to account for inherent spatio-temporal heterogeneity, as they typically apply a shared set of parameters across diverse regions and time periods. To address these challenges, we propose the Deformable Dynamic Convolutional Network (DDCN), a novel CNN-based architecture that integrates both deformable and dynamic convolution operations. The deformable layer introduces learnable offsets to create flexible receptive fields that better align with spatial irregularities, while the dynamic layer generates region-specific filters, allowing the model to adapt to varying spatio-temporal traffic patterns. By combining these two components, DDCN effectively captures both non-Euclidean spatial structures and spatio-temporal heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that DDCN achieves competitive predictive performance while significantly reducing computational costs, underscoring its potential for large-scale and real-time deployment.

Abstract: Vision-language models demand watermarking solutions that protect intellectual property without compromising multimodal coherence. Existing text watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable. We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination. Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities but often fail to generalize under distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) allows models to update at inference time without labeled data, typically via entropy minimization. However, this objective is fundamentally misaligned with the contrastive image-text training of VLMs, limiting adaptation performance and introducing failure modes such as pseudo-label drift and class collapse. We propose CLIPTTA, a new gradient-based TTA method for vision-language models that leverages a soft contrastive loss aligned with CLIP's pre-training objective. We provide a theoretical analysis of CLIPTTA's gradients, showing how its batch-aware design mitigates the risk of collapse. We further extend CLIPTTA to the open-set setting, where both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are encountered, using an Outlier Contrastive Exposure (OCE) loss to improve OOD detection. Evaluated on 75 datasets spanning diverse distribution shifts, CLIPTTA consistently outperforms entropy-based objectives and is highly competitive with state-of-the-art TTA methods, outperforming them on a large number of datasets and exhibiting more stable performance across diverse shifts.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-TEXT, a large-scale and high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To construct the SAR-TEXT dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks: image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA). Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT: SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 12.97% and 10.0% on the OSdataset_512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves significant improvements over the original CoCa models in terms of BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores. In the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that, as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets. All code, pretrained models, and the SAR-Text dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/YiguoHe/SAR-TEXT.

Abstract: Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated diagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is impeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality annotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which often miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address these issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal contrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized pathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of our method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively integrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by a progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal alignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we construct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that features extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and visual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently exceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results highlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and position RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical image understanding.

Abstract: Effective and efficient tokenization plays an important role in image representation and generation. Conventional methods, constrained by uniform 2D/1D grid tokenization, are inflexible to represent regions with varying shapes and textures and at different locations, limiting their efficacy of feature representation. In this work, we propose $\textbf{GPSToken}$, a novel $\textbf{G}$aussian $\textbf{P}$arameterized $\textbf{S}$patially-adaptive $\textbf{Token}$ization framework, to achieve non-uniform image tokenization by leveraging parametric 2D Gaussians to dynamically model the shape, position, and textures of different image regions. We first employ an entropy-driven algorithm to partition the image into texture-homogeneous regions of variable sizes. Then, we parameterize each region as a 2D Gaussian (mean for position, covariance for shape) coupled with texture features. A specialized transformer is trained to optimize the Gaussian parameters, enabling continuous adaptation of position/shape and content-aware feature extraction. During decoding, Gaussian parameterized tokens are reconstructed into 2D feature maps through a differentiable splatting-based renderer, bridging our adaptive tokenization with standard decoders for end-to-end training. GPSToken disentangles spatial layout (Gaussian parameters) from texture features to enable efficient two-stage generation: structural layout synthesis using lightweight networks, followed by structure-conditioned texture generation. Experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of GPSToken, which achieves rFID and FID scores of 0.65 and 1.50 on image reconstruction and generation tasks using 128 tokens, respectively.

Abstract: When conducting large-scale studies that collect brain MR images from multiple facilities, the impact of differences in imaging equipment and protocols at each site cannot be ignored, and this domain gap has become a significant issue in recent years. In this study, we propose a new low-dimensional representation (LDR) acquisition method called style encoder adversarial domain adaptation (SE-ADA) to realize content-based image retrieval (CBIR) of brain MR images. SE-ADA reduces domain differences while preserving pathological features by separating domain-specific information from LDR and minimizing domain differences using adversarial learning. In evaluation experiments comparing SE-ADA with recent domain harmonization methods on eight public brain MR datasets (ADNI1/2/3, OASIS1/2/3/4, PPMI), SE-ADA effectively removed domain information while preserving key aspects of the original brain structure and demonstrated the highest disease search accuracy.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel method for revealing human internal attention patterns from gameplay data alone, leveraging offline attention techniques from reinforcement learning (RL). We propose contextualized, task-relevant (CTR) attention networks, which generate attention maps from both human and RL agent gameplay in Atari environments. To evaluate whether the human CTR maps reveal internal attention, we validate our model by quantitative and qualitative comparison to the agent maps as well as to a temporally integrated overt attention (TIOA) model based on human eye-tracking data. Our results show that human CTR maps are more sparse than the agent ones and align better with the TIOA maps. Following a qualitative visual comparison we conclude that they likely capture patterns of internal attention. As a further application, we use these maps to guide RL agents, finding that human internal attention-guided agents achieve slightly improved and more stable learning compared to baselines. This work advances the understanding of human-agent attention differences and provides a new approach for extracting and validating internal attention from behavioral data.

Abstract: We present Phaser, a flexible system that directs narrow-beam laser light to moving robots for concurrent wireless power delivery and communication. We design a semi-automatic calibration procedure to enable fusion of stereo-vision-based 3D robot tracking with high-power beam steering, and a low-power optical communication scheme that reuses the laser light as a data channel. We fabricate a Phaser prototype using off-the-shelf hardware and evaluate its performance with battery-free autonomous robots. Phaser delivers optical power densities of over 110 mW/cm$^2$ and error-free data to mobile robots at multi-meter ranges, with on-board decoding drawing 0.3 mA ($97\%$ less current than Bluetooth Low Energy). We demonstrate Phaser fully powering gram-scale battery-free robots to nearly 2x higher speeds than prior work while simultaneously controlling them to navigate around obstacles and along paths. Code, an open-source design guide, and a demonstration video of Phaser is available at https://mobilex.cs.columbia.edu/phaser.

Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining is the cornerstone of histopathology but lacks molecular specificity. While Immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides molecular insights, it is costly and complex, motivating H&amp;E-to-IHC translation as a cost-effective alternative. Existing translation methods are mainly GAN-based, often struggling with training instability and limited structural fidelity, while diffusion-based approaches remain underexplored. We propose HistDiST, a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) based framework for high-fidelity H&amp;E-to-IHC translation. HistDiST introduces a dual-conditioning strategy, utilizing Phikon-extracted morphological embeddings alongside VAE-encoded H&amp;E representations to ensure pathology-relevant context and structural consistency. To overcome brightness biases, we incorporate a rescaled noise schedule, v-prediction, and trailing timesteps, enforcing a zero-SNR condition at the final timestep. During inference, DDIM inversion preserves the morphological structure, while an eta-cosine noise schedule introduces controlled stochasticity, balancing structural consistency and molecular fidelity. Moreover, we propose Molecular Retrieval Accuracy (MRA), a novel pathology-aware metric leveraging GigaPath embeddings to assess molecular relevance. Extensive evaluations on MIST and BCI datasets demonstrate that HistDiST significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a 28% improvement in MRA on the H&amp;E-to-Ki67 translation task, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing true IHC semantics.

Abstract: Rapid deployment of vision-language models (VLMs) magnifies safety risks, yet most evaluations rely on artificial images. This study asks: How safe are current VLMs when confronted with meme images that ordinary users share? To investigate this question, we introduce MemeSafetyBench, a 50,430-instance benchmark pairing real meme images with both harmful and benign instructions. Using a comprehensive safety taxonomy and LLM-based instruction generation, we assess multiple VLMs across single and multi-turn interactions. We investigate how real-world memes influence harmful outputs, the mitigating effects of conversational context, and the relationship between model scale and safety metrics. Our findings demonstrate that VLMs are more vulnerable to meme-based harmful prompts than to synthetic or typographic images. Memes significantly increase harmful responses and decrease refusals compared to text-only inputs. Though multi-turn interactions provide partial mitigation, elevated vulnerability persists. These results highlight the need for ecologically valid evaluations and stronger safety mechanisms. MemeSafetyBench is publicly available at https://github.com/oneonlee/Meme-Safety-Bench.

Abstract: Image deblurring plays a crucial role in enhancing visual clarity across various applications. Although most deep learning approaches primarily focus on sRGB images, which inherently lose critical information during the image signal processing pipeline, RAW images, being unprocessed and linear, possess superior restoration potential but remain underexplored. Deblurring RAW images presents unique challenges, particularly in handling frequency-dependent blur while maintaining computational efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Frequency Enhanced Network (FrENet), a framework specifically designed for RAW-to-RAW deblurring that operates directly in the frequency domain. We introduce a novel Adaptive Frequency Positional Modulation module, which dynamically adjusts frequency components according to their spectral positions, thereby enabling precise control over the deblurring process. Additionally, frequency domain skip connections are adopted to further preserve high-frequency details. Experimental results demonstrate that FrENet surpasses state-of-the-art deblurring methods in RAW image deblurring, achieving significantly better restoration quality while maintaining high efficiency in terms of reduced MACs. Furthermore, FrENet's adaptability enables it to be extended to sRGB images, where it delivers comparable or superior performance compared to methods specifically designed for sRGB data. The code will be available at https://github.com/WenlongJiao/FrENet .

<title>Perception-R1: Advancing Multimodal Reasoning Capabilities of MLLMs via Visual Perception Reward</title>

Abstract: Enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a challenging task that has attracted increasing attention in the community. Recently, several studies have applied Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to the multimodal domain in order to enhance the reasoning abilities of MLLMs. However, these works largely overlook the enhancement of multimodal perception capabilities in MLLMs, which serve as a core prerequisite and foundational component of complex multimodal reasoning. Through McNemar's test, we find that existing RLVR method fails to effectively enhance the multimodal perception capabilities of MLLMs, thereby limiting their further improvement in multimodal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose Perception-R1, which introduces a novel visual perception reward that explicitly encourages MLLMs to perceive the visual content accurately, thereby can effectively incentivizing both their multimodal perception and reasoning capabilities. Specifically, we first collect textual visual annotations from the CoT trajectories of multimodal problems, which will serve as visual references for reward assignment. During RLVR training, we employ a judging LLM to assess the consistency between the visual annotations and the responses generated by MLLM, and assign the visual perception reward based on these consistency judgments. Extensive experiments on several multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our Perception-R1, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on most benchmarks using only 1,442 training data.

Abstract: Advances in surgical video analysis are transforming operating rooms into intelligent, data-driven environments. Computer-assisted systems support full surgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and postoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models for surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation scarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across procedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap between deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its real-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing surgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked state-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective designs for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel architectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert annotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on reducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that improve model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled surgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST, SemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging surgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model training through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and advance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest gynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery video dataset. Together, this work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and clinically scalable solutions for surgical video analysis, laying the foundation for generalizable AI systems that can meaningfully impact surgical care and training.

<div> regularization, Gaussianity, text-to-image models, moment-based, power spectrum

Summary:
In this article, a novel regularization loss is proposed to enforce standard Gaussianity in samples, aligning them with a standard Gaussian distribution. The regularization combines moment-based and power spectrum-based techniques in spatial and spectral domains, respectively. By applying the loss to randomly permuted inputs, permutation invariance is ensured. Existing Gaussianity-based regularizations can be seen as specific cases within this unified framework. The efficacy of the proposed regularization is demonstrated in generative modeling for text-to-image tasks, where it improves aesthetics, text alignment, and prevents reward hacking. Compared to previous methods, the regularization accelerates convergence and outperforms in test-time reward alignment tasks. <div>

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity, encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates convergence.

<div> Keywords: Unified multimodal models, Reconstruction Alignment, visual understanding, generation, post-training

Summary: 
Unified multimodal models (UMMs) aim to combine visual understanding and generation in a single architecture. However, conventional training with image-text pairs often lacks fine-grained visual details in captions. In this study, a new method called Reconstruction Alignment (RecA) is introduced as a post-training technique for UMMs. RecA leverages visual understanding encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts" to improve generation quality without relying on sparse captions. By optimizing UMMs to reconstruct input images using self-supervised reconstruction loss, RecA effectively aligns understanding and generation. The results show that post-training with RecA significantly enhances image generation performance on various benchmarks, surpassing larger models while only requiring a fraction of the computational resources. This method demonstrates efficiency and effectiveness in improving UMMs across different architectures, making it a valuable tool in enhancing multimodal model performance.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours, post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit 6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

Summary:
DSLNet introduces a novel architecture for Isolated Sign Language Recognition, addressing the challenge of morphologically similar yet semantically distinct gestures. The architecture utilizes dual-reference, dual-stream networks to model gesture morphology and trajectory separately. A topology-aware graph convolution network captures view-invariant shape from a wrist-centric frame, while a Finsler geometry-based encoder handles context-aware trajectory from a facial-centric frame. These streams are integrated using a geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. The model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on WLASL-100, WLASL-300, and LSA64 datasets, outperforming existing models with fewer parameters. This approach effectively resolves geometric ambiguity in sign language recognition by decoupling and modeling the complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. <div>

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods, often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. The architecture processes these streams through specialized networks: a topology-aware graph convolution models the view-invariant shape from a wrist-centric frame, while a Finsler geometry-based encoder captures the context-aware trajectory from a facial-centric frame. These features are then integrated via a geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97%, and 99.79% accuracy on the challenging WLASL-100, WLASL-300, and LSA64 datasets, respectively, with significantly fewer parameters than competing models.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a new approach called Class-Invariant Test-Time Augmentation (CI-TTA) to improve the generalization performance of deep models under distribution shifts. The CI-TTA technique generates multiple variations of input images through elastic and grid deformations that belong to the same class as the original image. These variants are aggregated using a confidence-guided filtering scheme to ensure reliable predictions. The proposed CI-TTA method outperforms existing domain generalization algorithms and backbone architectures on datasets such as PACS and Office-Home. The lightweight test-time augmentation strategy offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional multi-domain training or test-time adaptation techniques. This approach demonstrates consistent improvements across different deep learning algorithms, highlighting its effectiveness and versatility in addressing domain shift challenges.

Abstract: Deep models often suffer significant performance degradation under distribution shifts. Domain generalization (DG) seeks to mitigate this challenge by enabling models to generalize to unseen domains. Most prior approaches rely on multi-domain training or computationally intensive test-time adaptation. In contrast, we propose a complementary strategy: lightweight test-time augmentation. Specifically, we develop a novel Class-Invariant Test-Time Augmentation (CI-TTA) technique. The idea is to generate multiple variants of each input image through elastic and grid deformations that nevertheless belong to the same class as the original input. Their predictions are aggregated through a confidence-guided filtering scheme that remove unreliable outputs, ensuring the final decision relies on consistent and trustworthy cues. Extensive Experiments on PACS and Office-Home datasets demonstrate consistent gains across different DG algorithms and backbones, highlighting the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

Abstract: We present AToken, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos, and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01 rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9% classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, AToken enables both visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI systems built upon unified visual tokenization.

Summary: <br />
Incremental multi-view clustering is a challenging task due to the Stability-Plasticity Dilemma (SPD), balancing stability and plasticity in learning from new data. Inspired by neuroscience, a new method called Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering (MemEvo) is proposed. MemEvo integrates a hippocampus-inspired view alignment module to capture new information, a cognitive forgetting mechanism to modulate the weights of historical knowledge, and a prefrontal cortex-inspired knowledge consolidation memory module for gradual consolidation. This approach enables MemEvo to achieve strong knowledge retention capabilities as the number of views grows. Experimental results show that MemEvo outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of incremental multi-view clustering. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.14544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incremental multi-view clustering aims to achieve stable clustering results while addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma (SPD) in incremental views. At the core of SPD is the challenge that the model must have enough plasticity to quickly adapt to new data, while maintaining sufficient stability to consolidate long-term knowledge and prevent catastrophic forgetting. Inspired by the hippocampal-prefrontal cortex collaborative memory mechanism in neuroscience, we propose a Memory-Evolving Incremental Multi-view Clustering method (MemEvo) to achieve this balance. First, we propose a hippocampus-inspired view alignment module that captures the gain information of new views by aligning structures in continuous representations. Second, we introduce a cognitive forgetting mechanism that simulates the decay patterns of human memory to modulate the weights of historical knowledge. Additionally, we design a prefrontal cortex-inspired knowledge consolidation memory module that leverages temporal tensor stability to gradually consolidate historical knowledge. By integrating these modules, MemEvo achieves strong knowledge retention capabilities in scenarios with a growing number of views. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MemEvo exhibits remarkable advantages over existing state-of-the-art methods.

<div> edge-guided attention mechanism, single-image super-resolution, perceptual quality, structural sharpness, parameter-efficient path <br />
Summary: 
This article introduces a novel approach to single-image super-resolution using an edge-guided attention mechanism. The mechanism combines edge features with intermediate feature activations to create an adaptive modulation map, which selectively enhances structurally important regions while suppressing spurious textures. This approach is integrated into a lightweight residual design trained under a composite objective that balances fidelity, perceptual realism, and training stability. The proposed method achieves consistent improvements in both structural sharpness and perceptual quality compared to existing techniques like SRGAN and ESRGAN at similar model complexity. By providing a parameter-efficient way to incorporate edge priors and leveraging a tailored multiterm loss for stabilized adversarial training, this approach demonstrates the effectiveness of principled edge-conditioned modulation for advancing perceptual super-resolution. <div>
arXiv:2509.14550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-image super-resolution (SISR) remains highly ill-posed because recovering structurally faithful high-frequency content from a single low-resolution observation is ambiguous. Existing edge-aware methods often attach edge priors or attention branches onto increasingly complex backbones, yet ad hoc fusion frequently introduces redundancy, unstable optimization, or limited structural gains. We address this gap with an edge-guided attention mechanism that derives an adaptive modulation map from jointly encoded edge features and intermediate feature activations, then applies it to normalize and reweight responses, selectively amplifying structurally salient regions while suppressing spurious textures. In parallel, we integrate this mechanism into a lightweight residual design trained under a composite objective combining pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial terms to balance fidelity, perceptual realism, and training stability. Extensive experiments on standard SISR benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in structural sharpness and perceptual quality over SRGAN, ESRGAN, and prior edge-attention baselines at comparable model complexity. The proposed formulation provides (i) a parameter-efficient path to inject edge priors, (ii) stabilized adversarial refinement through a tailored multiterm loss, and (iii) enhanced edge fidelity without resorting to deeper or heavily overparameterized architectures. These results highlight the effectiveness of principled edge-conditioned modulation for advancing perceptual super-resolution.

Summary:
The paper introduces an adaptive and iterative point cloud denoising method based on a score-based diffusion model. It addresses the challenge of efficiently arranging iterative denoising processes for different noise levels. The proposed method estimates noise variation to determine an adaptive denoising schedule and updates point clouds iteratively according to this schedule using a trained network. The network architecture and sampling strategy enable feature fusion and gradient fusion for iterative denoising.

Abstract: Point cloud denoising task aims to recover the clean point cloud from the scanned data coupled with different levels or patterns of noise. The recent state-of-the-art methods often train deep neural networks to update the point locations towards the clean point cloud, and empirically repeat the denoising process several times in order to obtain the denoised results. It is not clear how to efficiently arrange the iterative denoising processes to deal with different levels or patterns of noise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive and iterative point cloud denoising method based on the score-based diffusion model. For a given noisy point cloud, we first estimate the noise variation and determine an adaptive denoising schedule with appropriate step sizes, then invoke the trained network iteratively to update point clouds following the adaptive schedule. To facilitate this adaptive and iterative denoising process, we design the network architecture and a two-stage sampling strategy for the network training to enable feature fusion and gradient fusion for iterative denoising. Compared to the state-of-the-art point cloud denoising methods, our approach obtains clean and smooth denoised point clouds, while preserving the shape boundary and details better. Our results not only outperform the other methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, but also are preferable on the synthetic dataset with different patterns of noises, as well as the real-scanned dataset.

<div> GPS denoising, DiffVL, visual localization, diffusion models, sub-meter accuracy

Summary:
DiffVL is a novel framework for accurate visual localization in autonomous driving, addressing the limitations of costly HD maps by focusing on standard-definition (SD) maps like OpenStreetMap. It reformulates visual localization as a GPS denoising task using diffusion models, leveraging the noisy GPS signal in urban environments. By jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals, DiffVL achieves sub-meter accuracy without the need for HD maps. It outperforms existing Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching methods and transformer-based registration approaches, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy on multiple datasets. This approach showcases the potential of diffusion models in scalable localization, treating noisy GPS as a generative prior and offering a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based methods. <div>

Abstract: Accurate visual localization is crucial for autonomous driving, yet existing methods face a fundamental dilemma: While high-definition (HD) maps provide high-precision localization references, their costly construction and maintenance hinder scalability, which drives research toward standard-definition (SD) maps like OpenStreetMap. Current SD-map-based approaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and maps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily available, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose DiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS denoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS trajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly encode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative diffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g., OrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse GPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals, achieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines. Crucially, our work proves that diffusion models can enable scalable localization by treating noisy GPS as a generative prior-making a paradigm shift from traditional matching-based methods.

<br />
Summary:
Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium (DICE) is a framework introduced for sparse-view computed tomography reconstruction, addressing the challenge of undersampling. It integrates a two-agent consensus equilibrium into the sampling process of a diffusion model (DM) to effectively combine generative prior capabilities with measurement consistency. DICE alternates between a data-consistency agent enforcing measurement consistency and a prior agent performing image estimation using a DM. Experimental results demonstrate that DICE outperforms existing methods in reconstructing high-quality CT images under various sparse-view settings, showcasing its effectiveness and robustness in capturing complex image structures in medical imaging. <div>
arXiv:2509.14566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) reconstruction is fundamentally challenging due to undersampling, leading to an ill-posed inverse problem. Traditional iterative methods incorporate handcrafted or learned priors to regularize the solution but struggle to capture the complex structures present in medical images. In contrast, diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful generative priors that can accurately model complex image distributions. In this work, we introduce Diffusion Consensus Equilibrium (DICE), a framework that integrates a two-agent consensus equilibrium into the sampling process of a DM. DICE alternates between: (i) a data-consistency agent, implemented through a proximal operator enforcing measurement consistency, and (ii) a prior agent, realized by a DM performing a clean image estimation at each sampling step. By balancing these two complementary agents iteratively, DICE effectively combines strong generative prior capabilities with measurement consistency. Experimental results show that DICE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in reconstructing high-quality CT images under uniform and non-uniform sparse-view settings of 15, 30, and 60 views (out of a total of 180), demonstrating both its effectiveness and robustness.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation method to estimate the severity of Ulcerative Colitis (UC) by aligning class-wise distributions across different medical imaging domains. The method leverages patient-level diagnostic results as weak supervision in the target domain, improving UC severity estimation in domain-shifted settings. By using Shared Aggregation Tokens and a Max-Severity Triplet Loss, the method effectively addresses domain shifts caused by variations in imaging devices and clinical settings across hospitals. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to other Domain Adaptation approaches, resulting in a more accurate estimation of UC severity. <div>
arXiv:2509.14573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of methods to estimate the severity of Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is of significant importance. However, these methods often suffer from domain shifts caused by differences in imaging devices and clinical settings across hospitals. Although several domain adaptation methods have been proposed to address domain shift, they still struggle with the lack of supervision in the target domain or the high cost of annotation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Weakly Supervised Domain Adaptation method that leverages patient-level diagnostic results, which are routinely recorded in UC diagnosis, as weak supervision in the target domain. The proposed method aligns class-wise distributions across domains using Shared Aggregation Tokens and a Max-Severity Triplet Loss, which leverages the characteristic that patient-level diagnoses are determined by the most severe region within each patient. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparative DA approaches, improving UC severity estimation in a domain-shifted setting.

Summary:
The article introduces a benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban perception using 100 Montreal street images. Twelve participants provided annotations on physical attributes and subjective impressions of the scenes. French responses were normalized to English for evaluation. VLMs were tested in a zero-shot setup with structured prompts and a deterministic parser. Results show that models align better on visible, objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system, claude-sonnet, achieved significant scores on multi-label items. Higher human agreement correlated with better model performance. Synthetic images had slightly lower scores.

Abstract: Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible, objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet) reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible, uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the Feature-aligned Motion Transformation (FMT) framework for compressing dynamic point clouds efficiently. FMT replaces explicit motion vectors with a spatiotemporal alignment strategy that models continuous temporal variations by using aligned features within a latent-space conditional encoding framework. Additionally, a random access reference strategy enables bidirectional motion referencing and layered encoding for frame-level parallel compression. Extensive experiments show that FMT outperforms existing methods in both encoding and decoding efficiency, achieving BD-Rate reductions of 20% and 9.4% compared to D-DPCC and AdaDPCC, respectively. The results demonstrate the efficacy of FMT in enhancing compression efficiency and processing performance. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.14591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic point clouds are widely used in applications such as immersive reality, robotics, and autonomous driving. Efficient compression largely depends on accurate motion estimation and compensation, yet the irregular structure and significant local variations of point clouds make this task highly challenging. Current methods often rely on explicit motion estimation, whose encoded vectors struggle to capture intricate dynamics and fail to fully exploit temporal correlations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a Feature-aligned Motion Transformation (FMT) framework for dynamic point cloud compression. FMT replaces explicit motion vectors with a spatiotemporal alignment strategy that implicitly models continuous temporal variations, using aligned features as temporal context within a latent-space conditional encoding framework. Furthermore, we design a random access (RA) reference strategy that enables bidirectional motion referencing and layered encoding, thereby supporting frame-level parallel compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses D-DPCC and AdaDPCC in both encoding and decoding efficiency, while also achieving BD-Rate reductions of 20% and 9.4%, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of FMT in jointly improving compression efficiency and processing performance.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces HybridMamba, a novel architecture designed to enhance 3D biomedical image segmentation. HybridMamba addresses limitations in modeling long-range dependencies and computational overhead seen in CNNs and Transformer-based frameworks, respectively. It combines a feature scanning strategy that integrates axial-traversal and local-adaptive pathways to balance local and global representations and a gated module for comprehensive contextual modeling through spatial-frequency analysis. The researchers also collected a multi-center CT dataset related to lung cancer for experimentation. Results from tests on MRI and CT datasets show that HybridMamba outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in 3D medical image segmentation. The dual mechanisms employed in HybridMamba significantly improve segmentation accuracy by harmonizing local and global information while reducing boundary ambiguity and regional distortion in segmentation outputs. <div>

Abstract: In the domain of 3D biomedical image segmentation, Mamba exhibits the superior performance for it addresses the limitations in modeling long-range dependencies inherent to CNNs and mitigates the abundant computational overhead associated with Transformer-based frameworks when processing high-resolution medical volumes. However, attaching undue importance to global context modeling may inadvertently compromise critical local structural information, thus leading to boundary ambiguity and regional distortion in segmentation outputs. Therefore, we propose the HybridMamba, an architecture employing dual complementary mechanisms: 1) a feature scanning strategy that progressively integrates representations both axial-traversal and local-adaptive pathways to harmonize the relationship between local and global representations, and 2) a gated module combining spatial-frequency analysis for comprehensive contextual modeling. Besides, we collect a multi-center CT dataset related to lung cancer. Experiments on MRI and CT datasets demonstrate that HybridMamba significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in 3D medical image segmentation.

<div> Keywords: U-like networks, medical image segmentation, skip connections, dynamic skip connection, multi-scale feature interactions

Summary:
The article introduces a novel Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block to address limitations in traditional skip connections used in U-like networks for medical image segmentation. The DSC block consists of two components: the Test-Time Training (TTT) module and the Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. The TTT module enables dynamic adaptation of hidden representations during inference, enhancing feature refinement based on content. The DMSK module selects kernel sizes adaptively to improve multi-scale feature integration and address the intra-feature constraint. The DSC block can be seamlessly integrated into existing U-like network structures and has been shown to be effective across various network architectures, including CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based networks. The experimental results demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the DSC block in enhancing cross-layer connectivity and improving the performance of medical image segmentation tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.14610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image segmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and low-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like networks.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new framework, LSTC-MDA, to tackle challenges in skeleton-based action recognition. It addresses the scarcity of labeled training samples and difficulty modeling short- and long-range temporal dependencies. The framework incorporates a Long-Short Term Temporal Convolution (LSTC) module with parallel short- and long-term branches, aligned and fused adaptively using learned similarity weights. This helps preserve critical long-range cues lost by conventional temporal convolutions. Additionally, Joint Mixing Data Augmentation (JMDA) is extended with Additive Mixup at the input level to diversify training samples while avoiding distribution shifts within the same camera view. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component, leading to state-of-the-art results on NTU 60 (X-Sub and X-View), NTU 120 (X-Sub and X-Set), and NW-UCLA datasets.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition faces two longstanding challenges: the scarcity of labeled training samples and difficulty modeling short- and long-range temporal dependencies. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework, LSTC-MDA, which simultaneously improves temporal modeling and data diversity. We introduce a novel Long-Short Term Temporal Convolution (LSTC) module with parallel short- and long-term branches, these two feature branches are then aligned and fused adaptively using learned similarity weights to preserve critical long-range cues lost by conventional stride-2 temporal convolutions. We also extend Joint Mixing Data Augmentation (JMDA) with an Additive Mixup at the input level, diversifying training samples and restricting mixup operations to the same camera view to avoid distribution shifts. Ablation studies confirm each component contributes. LSTC-MDA achieves state-of-the-art results: 94.1% and 97.5% on NTU 60 (X-Sub and X-View), 90.4% and 92.0% on NTU 120 (X-Sub and X-Set),97.2% on NW-UCLA. Code: https://github.com/xiaobaoxia/LSTC-MDA.

Abstract: Current instruction-based image editing (IBIE) methods struggle with challenging editing tasks, as both editing types and sample counts of existing datasets are limited. Moreover, traditional dataset construction often contains noisy image-caption pairs, which may introduce biases and limit model capabilities in complex editing scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce MultiEdit, a comprehensive dataset featuring over 107K high-quality image editing samples. It encompasses 6 challenging editing tasks through a diverse collection of 18 non-style-transfer editing types and 38 style transfer operations, covering a spectrum from sophisticated style transfer to complex semantic operations like person reference editing and in-image text editing. We employ a novel dataset construction pipeline that utilizes two multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to generate visual-adaptive editing instructions and produce high-fidelity edited images, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning foundational open-source models with our MultiEdit-Train set substantially improves models' performance on sophisticated editing tasks in our proposed MultiEdit-Test benchmark, while effectively preserving their capabilities on the standard editing benchmark. We believe MultiEdit provides a valuable resource for advancing research into more diverse and challenging IBIE capabilities.

Abstract: In this study, we consider the problem of generating visual explanations in visual foundation models. Numerous methods have been proposed for this purpose; however, they often cannot be applied to complex models due to their lack of adaptability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel explanation generation method in visual foundation models that is aimed at both generating explanations and partially updating model parameters to enhance interpretability. Our approach introduces two novel mechanisms: Attention Lattice Adapter (ALA) and Alternating Epoch Architect (AEA). ALA mechanism simplifies the process by eliminating the need for manual layer selection, thus enhancing the model's adaptability and interpretability. Moreover, the AEA mechanism, which updates ALA's parameters every other epoch, effectively addresses the common issue of overly small attention regions. We evaluated our method on two benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S. Our results showed that our method outperformed the baseline methods in terms of mean intersection over union (IoU), insertion score, deletion score, and insertion-deletion score on both the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-S datasets. Notably, our best model achieved a 53.2-point improvement in mean IoU on the CUB-200-2011 dataset compared with the baselines.

Abstract: Automatic colorization of line drawings has been widely studied to reduce the labor cost of hand-drawn anime production. Deep learning approaches, including image/video generation and feature-based correspondence, have improved accuracy but struggle with occlusions, pose variations, and viewpoint changes. To address these challenges, we propose DACoN, a framework that leverages foundation models to capture part-level semantics, even in line drawings. Our method fuses low-resolution semantic features from foundation models with high-resolution spatial features from CNNs for fine-grained yet robust feature extraction. In contrast to previous methods that rely on the Multiplex Transformer and support only one or two reference images, DACoN removes this constraint, allowing any number of references. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the benefits of using multiple reference images, achieving superior colorization performance. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/kzmngt/DACoN.

The article introduces the FMGS-Avatar method for reconstructing high-fidelity animatable human avatars from monocular videos. This new approach integrates Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian Splatting, which improves surface alignment and geometric detail preservation by attaching Gaussian primitives to template mesh faces. By leveraging foundation models trained on large-scale datasets like Sapiens, the method complements visual cues from monocular videos. Conflicting optimization objectives arising from multi-modal prior knowledge are addressed through selective gradient isolation during coordinated training. The FMGS-Avatar method significantly advances 3D monocular human avatar reconstruction, with superior reconstruction quality in geometric accuracy and appearance fidelity, as well as rich semantic information. The shared canonical space of distilled prior knowledge enables spatially and temporally consistent rendering under novel views and poses. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.14739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable human avatars from monocular videos remains challenging due to insufficient geometric information in single-view observations. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have shown promise, they struggle with surface detail preservation due to the free-form nature of 3D Gaussian primitives. To address both the representation limitations and information scarcity, we propose a novel method, \textbf{FMGS-Avatar}, that integrates two key innovations. First, we introduce Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian Splatting, where 2D Gaussian primitives are attached directly to template mesh faces with constrained position, rotation, and movement, enabling superior surface alignment and geometric detail preservation. Second, we leverage foundation models trained on large-scale datasets, such as Sapiens, to complement the limited visual cues from monocular videos. However, when distilling multi-modal prior knowledge from foundation models, conflicting optimization objectives can emerge as different modalities exhibit distinct parameter sensitivities. We address this through a coordinated training strategy with selective gradient isolation, enabling each loss component to optimize its relevant parameters without interference. Through this combination of enhanced representation and coordinated information distillation, our approach significantly advances 3D monocular human avatar reconstruction. Experimental evaluation demonstrates superior reconstruction quality compared to existing methods, with notable gains in geometric accuracy and appearance fidelity while providing rich semantic information. Additionally, the distilled prior knowledge within a shared canonical space naturally enables spatially and temporally consistent rendering under novel views and poses.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method for image retrieval that utilizes Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for direct participation in the ranking process. By designing a listwise ranking prompt, the MLLM can re-rank candidate images based on their alignment with the user's query. This enables global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable decision-making for accurate image retrieval. Additionally, a query deconstruction prompt breaks down the query into semantic components for structured analysis. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets show that CoTRR achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image retrieval (TIR), composed image retrieval (CIR), and chat-based image retrieval (Chat-IR) tasks.

Abstract: Image retrieval remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer vision. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods typically employ them only for evaluation, without involving them directly in the ranking process. As a result, their rich multimodal reasoning abilities remain underutilized, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method to address this issue. Specifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly participate in re-ranking candidate images. This ranking process is grounded in an image evaluation prompt, which assesses how well each candidate aligns with users query. By allowing MLLM to perform listwise reasoning, our method supports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable decision-making - all of which are essential for accurate image retrieval. To enable structured and fine-grained analysis, we further introduce a query deconstruction prompt, which breaks down the original query into multiple semantic components. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our CoTRR method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across three image retrieval tasks, including text-to-image retrieval (TIR), composed image retrieval (CIR) and chat-based image retrieval (Chat-IR). Our code is available at https://github.com/freshfish15/CoTRR .

Abstract: Finding smell references in historic artworks is a challenging problem. Beyond artwork-specific challenges such as stylistic variations, their recognition demands exceptionally detailed annotation classes, resulting in annotation sparsity and extreme class imbalance. In this work, we explore the potential of synthetic data generation to alleviate these issues and enable accurate detection of smell-related objects. We evaluate several diffusion-based augmentation strategies and demonstrate that incorporating synthetic data into model training can improve detection performance. Our findings suggest that leveraging the large-scale pretraining of diffusion models offers a promising approach for improving detection accuracy, particularly in niche applications where annotations are scarce and costly to obtain. Furthermore, the proposed approach proves to be effective even with relatively small amounts of data, and scaling it up provides high potential for further enhancements.

Summary: 
This study addresses the complexity of comparing vision language models (VLMs) on videos. The performance of these models is influenced by both their visual representation capacity and the frame-sampling strategy used to construct input.

Abstract: Comparing vision language models on videos is particularly complex, as the performances is jointly determined by the model's visual representation capacity and the frame-sampling strategy used to construct the input. Current video benchmarks are suspected to suffer from substantial frame-sampling bias, as models are evaluated with different frame selection strategies. In this work, we propose the first frame-accurate benchmark of state-of-the-art small VLMs for video question-answering, evaluated under controlled frame-sampling strategies. Our results confirm the suspected bias and highlight both data-specific and task-specific behaviors of SVLMs under different frame-sampling techniques. By open-sourcing our benchmarking code, we provide the community with a reproducible and unbiased protocol for evaluating video VLMs and emphasize the need for standardized frame-sampling strategies tailored to each benchmarking dataset in future research.

Abstract: In recent years, parametric representations of point clouds have been widely applied in tasks such as memory-efficient mapping and multi-robot collaboration. Highly adaptive models, like spline surfaces or quadrics, are computationally expensive in detection or fitting. In contrast, real-time methods, such as Gaussian mixture models or planes, have low degrees of freedom, making high accuracy with few primitives difficult. To tackle this problem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface detection and fitting is proposed. Specifically, the Gaussian mixture model is first employed to segment the point cloud into multiple clusters. Then, flat clusters are selected and merged into planes or curved surfaces. Planes can be easily fitted and delimited by a 2D voxel-based boundary description method. Surfaces with curvature are fitted by B-spline surfaces and the same boundary description method is employed. Through evaluations on multiple public datasets, the proposed surface detection exhibits greater robustness than the state-of-the-art approach, with 3.78 times improvement in efficiency. Meanwhile, this representation achieves a 2-fold gain in accuracy over Gaussian mixture models, operating at 36.4 fps on a low-power onboard computer.

<div> Keywords: deep neural networks, data distillation, image super-resolution, generative adversarial network, diffusion model

Summary:
Data distillation methods have become crucial for training deep neural networks, particularly in tasks like single image super-resolution (SISR) where large datasets are required. A new data distillation approach for SISR has been introduced that does not rely on pre-trained models or class labels. This method involves extracting high-gradient patches and categorizing images based on CLIP features to fine-tune a diffusion model and synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less training data and computational time. For instance, training a Transformer model for SR with only 0.68% of the original dataset resulted in a minimal performance drop of 0.3 dB, with diffusion model fine-tuning taking 4 hours and SR model training completing within 1 hour, much faster than training with the full dataset.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Training deep neural networks has become increasingly demanding, requiring large datasets and significant computational resources, especially as model complexity advances. Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data efficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field of single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training datasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR was proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the current method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific information, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these issues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does not need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract high-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then fine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution and synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less training data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we train a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\% of the original dataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model fine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much shorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset.

Abstract: Text to image latent diffusion models have recently advanced medical image synthesis, but applications to 3D CT generation remain limited. Existing approaches rely on simplified prompts, neglecting the rich semantic detail in full radiology reports, which reduces text image alignment and clinical fidelity. We propose Report2CT, a radiology report conditional latent diffusion framework for synthesizing 3D chest CT volumes directly from free text radiology reports, incorporating both findings and impression sections using multiple text encoder. Report2CT integrates three pretrained medical text encoders (BiomedVLP CXR BERT, MedEmbed, and ClinicalBERT) to capture nuanced clinical context. Radiology reports and voxel spacing information condition a 3D latent diffusion model trained on 20000 CT volumes from the CT RATE dataset. Model performance was evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for real synthetic distributional similarity and CLIP based metrics for semantic alignment, with additional qualitative and quantitative comparisons against GenerateCT model. Report2CT generated anatomically consistent CT volumes with excellent visual quality and text image alignment. Multi encoder conditioning improved CLIP scores, indicating stronger preservation of fine grained clinical details in the free text radiology reports. Classifier free guidance further enhanced alignment with only a minor trade off in FID. We ranked first in the VLM3D Challenge at MICCAI 2025 on Text Conditional CT Generation and achieved state of the art performance across all evaluation metrics. By leveraging complete radiology reports and multi encoder text conditioning, Report2CT advances 3D CT synthesis, producing clinically faithful and high quality synthetic data.

<div> Keywords: bone segmentation, geodesic active contour, edge detection, fracture interaction, distance information

Summary:
The article introduces a new fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm designed specifically for bone segmentation. Traditional methods often struggle with edge obstruction, leakage, and fractures, leading to inaccurate results. The proposed algorithm addresses these challenges by incorporating a novel edge-detection function that combines intensity and gradient norm to accurately identify bone edges while minimizing mis-segmentation. Additionally, distance information is integrated into the contour evolution process, allowing for the interaction with bone fractures and enhancing segmentation accuracy in fracture regions. Experimental results on pelvic and ankle segmentation demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in achieving accurate, stable, and consistent bone segmentation. The algorithm highlights the importance of combining domain knowledge with deep neural networks for improved segmentation performance.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.14817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For bone segmentation, the classical geodesic active contour model is usually limited by its indiscriminate feature extraction, and then struggles to handle the phenomena of edge obstruction, edge leakage and bone fracture. Thus, we propose a fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm tailored for bone segmentation, which can better capture bone features and perform robustly to the presence of bone fractures and soft tissues. Inspired by orthopedic knowledge, we construct a novel edge-detector function that combines the intensity and gradient norm, which guides the contour towards bone edges without being obstructed by other soft tissues and therefore reduces mis-segmentation. Furthermore, distance information, where fracture prompts can be embedded, is introduced into the contour evolution as an adaptive step size to stabilize the evolution and help the contour stop at bone edges and fractures. This embedding provides a way to interact with bone fractures and improves the accuracy in the fracture regions. Experiments in pelvic and ankle segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness on addressing the aforementioned problems and show an accurate, stable and consistent performance, indicating a broader application in other bone anatomies. Our algorithm also provides insights into combining the domain knowledge and deep neural networks.

Summary:
Cortical surface reconstruction from MRI is vital for neuroimage analysis, allowing for studies on the cerebral cortex and brain mapping. Learning-based methods have sped up processing significantly, but ensuring optimal deformations and consistency remains a challenge. A Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) loss is introduced to regularize deformation trajectories in the V2C-Flow model. This additional loss results in improved training consistency and reproducibility without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy or topological correctness. The MED loss acts as a complement to the commonly used Chamfer distance in cortical surface reconstruction, enhancing the overall performance of the model. This innovation in regularization techniques addresses previous limitations in training consistency and ensures that the learned deformations are both efficient and reliable for further analysis.

Abstract: Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is fundamental to neuroimage analysis, enabling morphological studies of the cerebral cortex and functional brain mapping. Recent advances in learning-based CSR have dramatically accelerated processing, allowing for reconstructions through the deformation of anatomical templates within seconds. However, ensuring the learned deformations are optimal in terms of deformation energy and consistent across training runs remains a particular challenge. In this work, we design a Minimal Energy Deformation (MED) loss, acting as a regularizer on the deformation trajectories and complementing the widely used Chamfer distance in CSR. We incorporate it into the recent V2C-Flow model and demonstrate considerable improvements in previously neglected training consistency and reproducibility without harming reconstruction accuracy and topological correctness.

Summary: <br />
Bone health studies are essential for early detection and treatment of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Current diagnosis methods rely on densitometry and patient history, with AI research focusing on deep learning models for accuracy. However, explainability is often overlooked. ProtoMedX, a multi-modal model, utilizes DEXA scans and patient records, with a prototype-based architecture that ensures explainability. This is crucial for medical applications and aligns with upcoming regulations like the EU AI Act. ProtoMedX achieves top performance in bone health classification, with 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8% in the multi-modal variant, surpassing existing methods. Its explanations are visually understandable by clinicians, making it a valuable tool for diagnosing and treating bone health conditions effectively. <div>

Abstract: Bone health studies are crucial in medical practice for the early detection and treatment of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Clinicians usually make a diagnosis based on densitometry (DEXA scans) and patient history. The applications of AI in this field are ongoing research. Most successful methods rely on deep learning models that use vision alone (DEXA/X-ray imagery) and focus on prediction accuracy, while explainability is often disregarded and left to post hoc assessments of input contributions. We propose ProtoMedX, a multi-modal model that uses both DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient records. ProtoMedX's prototype-based architecture is explainable by design, which is crucial for medical applications, especially in the context of the upcoming EU AI Act, as it allows explicit analysis of model decisions, including incorrect ones. ProtoMedX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in bone health classification while also providing explanations that can be visually understood by clinicians. Using a dataset of 4,160 real NHS patients, the proposed ProtoMedX achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8% in its multi-modal variant, both surpassing existing published methods.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.14841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizable Image Super-Resolution aims to enhance model generalization capabilities under unknown degradations. To achieve this goal, the models are expected to focus only on image content-related features instead of overfitting degradations. Recently, numerous approaches such as Dropout and Feature Alignment have been proposed to suppress models' natural tendency to overfit degradations and yield promising results. Nevertheless, these works have assumed that models overfit to all degradation types (e.g., blur, noise, JPEG), while through careful investigations in this paper, we discover that models predominantly overfit to noise, largely attributable to its distinct degradation pattern compared to other degradation types. In this paper, we propose a targeted feature denoising framework, comprising noise detection and denoising modules. Our approach presents a general solution that can be seamlessly integrated with existing super-resolution models without requiring architectural modifications. Our framework demonstrates superior performance compared to previous regularization-based methods across five traditional benchmarks and datasets, encompassing both synthetic and real-world scenarios.

Summary: 
The paper introduces Multi Agent based Reasoning for Image Classification (MARIC), a framework that approaches image classification as a collaborative process involving multiple agents. MARIC consists of an Outliner Agent, three Aspect Agents, and a Reasoning Agent, each responsible for different aspects of image analysis. The Outliner Agent identifies the global theme of the image, prompting the Aspect Agents to extract fine-grained descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. The Reasoning Agent then synthesizes these outputs to create a unified representation for classification. By utilizing multiple agents and encouraging reflective synthesis, MARIC improves performance over traditional methods and single-pass vision language models. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MARIC for robust and interpretable image classification. <div>
arXiv:2509.14860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model training, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to achieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs) alleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on single pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of visual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for Image Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image classification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an Outliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted prompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained descriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent synthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step, producing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly decomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective synthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training and monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification benchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and interpretable image classification.

Abstract: The growing use of portrait images in computer vision highlights the need to protect personal identities. At the same time, anonymized images must remain useful for downstream computer vision tasks. In this work, we propose a unified framework that leverages the inpainting ability of latent diffusion models to generate realistic anonymized images. Unlike prior approaches, we have complete control over the anonymization process by designing an adaptive attribute-guidance module that applies gradient correction during the reverse denoising process, aligning the facial attributes of the generated image with those of the synthesized target image. Our framework also supports localized anonymization, allowing users to specify which facial regions are left unchanged. Extensive experiments conducted on the public CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while requiring no additional model training.

This study focuses on predicting pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) using a multi-task model that analyzes longitudinal change in MRI data. The model learns a representation of early treatment response dynamics from MRI data, resulting in trajectories in a latent space. By incorporating appearance representation, temporal continuity, and accounting for heterogeneity in non-responder cohorts, the model achieves promising results on the ISPY-2 dataset. A linear classifier in the latent trajectory space shows balanced accuracy rates of 0.761 with pre-treatment data (T0), 0.811 with early response data (T0 + T1), and 0.861 with four imaging time points (T0 -> T3). The code for this model will be made available upon paper acceptance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Effective therapy decisions require models that predict the individual response to treatment. This is challenging since the progression of disease and response to treatment vary substantially across patients. Here, we propose to learn a representation of the early dynamics of treatment response from imaging data to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The longitudinal change in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of the breast forms trajectories in the latent space, serving as basis for prediction of successful response. The multi-task model represents appearance, fosters temporal continuity and accounts for the comparably high heterogeneity in the non-responder cohort.In experiments on the publicly available ISPY-2 dataset, a linear classifier in the latent trajectory space achieves a balanced accuracy of 0.761 using only pre-treatment data (T0), 0.811 using early response (T0 + T1), and 0.861 using four imaging time points (T0 -> T3). The code will be made available upon paper acceptance.

<div> Keywords: on-orbit operations, spacecraft pose estimation, 3D visual cues, NeRF-based image generator, pose estimation network

Summary: 
On-orbit operations necessitate accurate estimation of the relative position and orientation of a chaser spacecraft compared to its target. Existing data-driven methods for spacecraft pose estimation face challenges in real missions due to a lack of insight into their decision-making processes. This paper introduces a novel approach to visualize the 3D visual cues utilized by a pose estimator. By training a NeRF-based image generator with gradients from the pose estimation network, the generator can render the primary 3D features crucial for pose estimation. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this method in recovering the essential 3D cues. Additionally, the approach sheds light on the relationship between the supervision of the pose estimation network and its implicit representation of the target spacecraft.

Abstract: On-orbit operations require the estimation of the relative 6D pose, i.e., position and orientation, between a chaser spacecraft and its target. While data-driven spacecraft pose estimation methods have been developed, their adoption in real missions is hampered by the lack of understanding of their decision process. This paper presents a method to visualize the 3D visual cues on which a given pose estimator relies. For this purpose, we train a NeRF-based image generator using the gradients back-propagated through the pose estimation network. This enforces the generator to render the main 3D features exploited by the spacecraft pose estimation network. Experiments demonstrate that our method recovers the relevant 3D cues. Furthermore, they offer additional insights on the relationship between the pose estimation network supervision and its implicit representation of the target spacecraft.

Summary: 
Complex Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is a challenging task due to various factors like small targets, occlusions, rapid motion, and interactions. This report presents a solution for the LSVOS 2025 VOS Track using the SAM2 framework. A pseudo-labeling strategy is employed during training, where SAM2 checkpoint generates labels for the MOSE test set. In inference, SAM2Long framework provides primary segmentation results, while the SeC model generates complementary predictions. A cascaded decision mechanism integrates outputs from both models dynamically. The approach achieves a J&amp;F score of 0.8616 on the MOSE test set, surpassing the baseline and securing 2nd place in the VOS competition. The method demonstrates robustness and accuracy in long, complex video segmentation scenarios.

Abstract: Complex Video Object Segmentation (VOS) presents significant challenges in accurately segmenting objects across frames, especially in the presence of small and similar targets, frequent occlusions, rapid motion, and complex interactions. In this report, we present our solution for the LSVOS 2025 VOS Track based on the SAM2 framework. We adopt a pseudo-labeling strategy during training: a trained SAM2 checkpoint is deployed within the SAM2Long framework to generate pseudo labels for the MOSE test set, which are then combined with existing data for further training. For inference, the SAM2Long framework is employed to obtain our primary segmentation results, while an open-source SeC model runs in parallel to produce complementary predictions. A cascaded decision mechanism dynamically integrates outputs from both models, exploiting the temporal stability of SAM2Long and the concept-level robustness of SeC. Benefiting from pseudo-label training and cascaded multi-model inference, our approach achieves a J\&amp;F score of 0.8616 on the MOSE test set -- +1.4 points over our SAM2Long baseline -- securing the 2nd place in the LSVOS 2025 VOS Track, and demonstrating strong robustness and accuracy in long, complex video segmentation scenarios.

<div> Fine-tuned models, CLIP, over-specialization, cross-domain generalization, trade-offs <br />
Summary: <br />
The study evaluates the impact of fine-tuning CLIP for specialized biometric tasks like face recognition (FR), morphing attack detection (MAD), and presentation attack detection (PAD) on its cross-domain generalization abilities. Results show that fine-tuned models may suffer from over-specialization, especially with complex tasks like FR. The study also notes that task complexity and the design of the classification head influence catastrophic forgetting. The ViT-L backbone outperforms other approaches on the IJB-C FR benchmark but experiences performance drops on ImageNetV2. Larger CLIP architectures better preserve generalization abilities than smaller variants, suggesting that increased model capacity may help mitigate over-specialization. <div>
arXiv:2509.14921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models such as CLIP have demonstrated exceptional zero- and few-shot transfer capabilities across diverse vision tasks. However, when fine-tuned for highly specialized biometric tasks, face recognition (FR), morphing attack detection (MAD), and presentation attack detection (PAD), these models may suffer from over-specialization. Thus, they may lose one of their foundational strengths, cross-domain generalization. In this work, we systematically quantify these trade-offs by evaluating three instances of CLIP fine-tuned for FR, MAD, and PAD. We evaluate each adapted model as well as the original CLIP baseline on 14 general vision datasets under zero-shot and linear-probe protocols, alongside common FR, MAD, and PAD benchmarks. Our results indicate that fine-tuned models suffer from over-specialization, especially when fine-tuned for complex tasks of FR. Also, our results pointed out that task complexity and classification head design, multi-class (FR) vs. binary (MAD and PAD), correlate with the degree of catastrophic forgetting. The FRoundation model with the ViT-L backbone outperforms other approaches on the large-scale FR benchmark IJB-C, achieving an improvement of up to 58.52%. However, it experiences a substantial performance drop on ImageNetV2, reaching only 51.63% compared to 69.84% achieved by the baseline CLIP model. Moreover, the larger CLIP architecture consistently preserves more of the model's original generalization ability than the smaller variant, indicating that increased model capacity may help mitigate over-specialization.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new framework called DF-LLaVA for detecting synthetic image forgeries. Existing models focus on binary judgments, lacking interpretability. DF-LLaVA leverages MLLMs to extract latent knowledge and improve detection accuracy through prompts. This approach enhances both accuracy and interpretability, outperforming expert models in authenticity classification.

Abstract: With the increasing prevalence of synthetic images, evaluating image authenticity and locating forgeries accurately while maintaining human interpretability remains a challenging task. Existing detection models primarily focus on simple authenticity classification, ultimately providing only a forgery probability or binary judgment, which offers limited explanatory insights into image authenticity. Moreover, while MLLM-based detection methods can provide more interpretable results, they still lag behind expert models in terms of pure authenticity classification accuracy. To address this, we propose DF-LLaVA, a simple yet effective framework that unlocks the intrinsic discrimination potential of MLLMs. Our approach first extracts latent knowledge from MLLMs and then injects it into training via prompts. This framework allows LLaVA to achieve outstanding detection accuracy exceeding expert models while still maintaining the interpretability offered by MLLMs. Extensive experiments confirm the superiority of our DF-LLaVA, achieving both high accuracy and explainability in synthetic image detection.

<div> Keywords: 3D digital content, class-incremental learning, geometric rectification, texture bias, cross-modal fusion

Summary:
Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR) addresses challenges in 3D few-shot class-incremental learning by enhancing geometric fidelity and reducing texture bias. The proposed framework integrates CLIP's spatial semantics to align 3D structures with hierarchical spatial priors and synthesizes discriminative textures for cross-modal consistency. A Structure-Aware Geometric Rectification module aligns 3D part structures with CLIP's spatial priors through attention-driven fusion, while a Texture Amplification Module suppresses noise and reinforces consistency. A Base-Novel Discriminator stabilizes incremental prototypes by isolating geometric variations. Experimental results show improved geometric coherence and robustness to texture bias in both cross-domain and within-domain settings. CMGR demonstrates superior performance in 3D class-incremental learning for open-world scenarios with extreme data scarcity. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.14958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of 3D digital content necessitates expandable recognition systems for open-world scenarios. However, existing 3D class-incremental learning methods struggle under extreme data scarcity due to geometric misalignment and texture bias. While recent approaches integrate 3D data with 2D foundation models (e.g., CLIP), they suffer from semantic blurring caused by texture-biased projections and indiscriminate fusion of geometric-textural cues, leading to unstable decision prototypes and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR), a framework that enhances 3D geometric fidelity by leveraging CLIP's hierarchical spatial semantics. Specifically, we introduce a Structure-Aware Geometric Rectification module that hierarchically aligns 3D part structures with CLIP's intermediate spatial priors through attention-driven geometric fusion. Additionally, a Texture Amplification Module synthesizes minimal yet discriminative textures to suppress noise and reinforce cross-modal consistency. To further stabilize incremental prototypes, we employ a Base-Novel Discriminator that isolates geometric variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves 3D few-shot class-incremental learning, achieving superior geometric coherence and robustness to texture bias across cross-domain and within-domain settings.

Summary:
The study introduces Brain-HGCN, a geometric deep learning framework based on hyperbolic geometry, for analyzing fMRI data. This framework leverages negatively curved space to accurately model the hierarchical topology of functional brain networks. By employing a hyperbolic graph attention layer with a signed aggregation mechanism, Brain-HGCN can effectively capture both excitatory and inhibitory connections in fMRI data. The model utilizes a geometrically sound Fr\'echet mean for graph readout, enabling robust graph-level representations. Experimental results on large-scale fMRI datasets show that Brain-HGCN outperforms existing Euclidean-based methods in psychiatric disorder classification tasks. This research marks a significant advancement in computational psychiatry by demonstrating the potential of hyperbolic graph neural networks in improving the analysis of complex brain networks. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.14965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a powerful non-invasive window into the brain's functional organization by generating complex functional networks, typically modeled as graphs. These brain networks exhibit a hierarchical topology that is crucial for cognitive processing. However, due to inherent spatial constraints, standard Euclidean GNNs struggle to represent these hierarchical structures without high distortion, limiting their clinical performance. To address this limitation, we propose Brain-HGCN, a geometric deep learning framework based on hyperbolic geometry, which leverages the intrinsic property of negatively curved space to model the brain's network hierarchy with high fidelity. Grounded in the Lorentz model, our model employs a novel hyperbolic graph attention layer with a signed aggregation mechanism to distinctly process excitatory and inhibitory connections, ultimately learning robust graph-level representations via a geometrically sound Fr\'echet mean for graph readout. Experiments on two large-scale fMRI datasets for psychiatric disorder classification demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art Euclidean baselines. This work pioneers a new geometric deep learning paradigm for fMRI analysis, highlighting the immense potential of hyperbolic GNNs in the field of computational psychiatry.

<div> Keywords: e-commerce, object identification, warehouse automation, 3D reasoning, image matching

Summary:
RoboEye addresses the challenge of accurate object identification in large-scale e-commerce warehouses by leveraging a two-stage identification framework. The first stage involves training a vision model to extract 2D features for generating candidate rankings, while a lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module estimates 3D feature quality to determine the need for 3D re-ranking. The second stage utilizes a robot 3D retrieval transformer that incorporates geometry-aware dense features and a keypoint-based matcher for computing keypoint-correspondence confidences. By dynamically augmenting 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D reasoning and lightweight adapters, RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the previous state of the art. Importantly, RoboEye operates solely using RGB images, eliminating the need for explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs. This approach enables more accurate object identification in the face of the growing complexity and variability of product categories in e-commerce warehouses. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.14966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce makes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses substantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and a long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with diverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large viewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and reference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely on 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification framework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D reasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the first stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for generating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then estimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary, preventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When invoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a 3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a keypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences between query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity scoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior state of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images, avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs.

<div> Keywords: rotation-invariant, point cloud, autoencoders, masking, semantic coherence

Summary:
Existing rotation-invariant point cloud masked autoencoders face limitations due to random masking strategies that do not consider geometric structure and semantic coherence. This paper introduces a dual-stream masking approach, combining 3D Spatial Grid Masking and Progressive Semantic Masking. The Grid masking captures geometric relationships that persist across orientations, while Semantic masking identifies semantically meaningful parts and maintains their coherence during masking. These streams are integrated via curriculum learning with dynamic weighting, progressing from geometric understanding to semantic discovery. The proposed approach is plug-and-play and compatible with existing rotation-invariant frameworks. Experimental results on various datasets show significant performance improvements over baseline methods in different rotation scenarios. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the dual-stream masking approach in enhancing rotation-invariant point cloud autoencoders. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.14975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing rotation-invariant point cloud masked autoencoders (MAE) rely on random masking strategies that overlook geometric structure and semantic coherence. Random masking treats patches independently, failing to capture spatial relationships consistent across orientations and overlooking semantic object parts that maintain identity regardless of rotation. We propose a dual-stream masking approach combining 3D Spatial Grid Masking and Progressive Semantic Masking to address these fundamental limitations. Grid masking creates structured patterns through coordinate sorting to capture geometric relationships that persist across different orientations, while semantic masking uses attention-driven clustering to discover semantically meaningful parts and maintain their coherence during masking. These complementary streams are orchestrated via curriculum learning with dynamic weighting, progressing from geometric understanding to semantic discovery. Designed as plug-and-play components, our strategies integrate into existing rotation-invariant frameworks without architectural changes, ensuring broad compatibility across different approaches. Comprehensive experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and OmniObject3D demonstrate consistent improvements across various rotation scenarios, showing substantial performance gains over the baseline rotation-invariant methods.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging has become the preferred imaging modality for early cancer screening due to its advantages of non-ionizing radiation, low cost, and real-time imaging capabilities. However, conventional ultrasound diagnosis heavily relies on physician expertise, presenting challenges of high subjectivity and low diagnostic efficiency. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer promising solutions for this issue, but existing general-purpose models demonstrate limited knowledge in ultrasound medical tasks, with poor generalization in multi-organ lesion recognition and low efficiency across multi-task diagnostics. To address these limitations, we propose EchoVLM, a vision-language model specifically designed for ultrasound medical imaging. The model employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture trained on data spanning seven anatomical regions. This design enables the model to perform multiple tasks, including ultrasound report generation, diagnosis and visual question-answering (VQA). The experimental results demonstrated that EchoVLM achieved significant improvements of 10.15 and 4.77 points in BLEU-1 scores and ROUGE-1 scores respectively compared to Qwen2-VL on the ultrasound report generation task. These findings suggest that EchoVLM has substantial potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging, thereby providing a viable technical solution for future clinical applications.

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity 3D models of indoor environments is essential for applications in design, virtual reality, and robotics. However, manual 3D modeling remains time-consuming and labor-intensive. While recent advances in generative AI have enabled automated scene synthesis, existing methods often face challenges in balancing visual quality, diversity, semantic consistency, and user control. A major bottleneck is the lack of a large-scale, high-quality dataset tailored to this task. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive synthetic dataset, featuring 12,328 structured annotated scenes with 57,440 rooms, and 4.7M photorealistic 2D renderings. Leveraging this dataset, we present SpatialGen, a novel multi-view multi-modal diffusion model that generates realistic and semantically consistent 3D indoor scenes. Given a 3D layout and a reference image (derived from a text prompt), our model synthesizes appearance (color image), geometry (scene coordinate map), and semantic (semantic segmentation map) from arbitrary viewpoints, while preserving spatial consistency across modalities. SpatialGen consistently generates superior results to previous methods in our experiments. We are open-sourcing our data and models to empower the community and advance the field of indoor scene understanding and generation.

Summary:
- Traditional image retrieval in retail settings is challenging due to the similarity of products and varied query image angles.
- Existing models struggle to distinguish subtle local differences between products.
- The PRISM method combines vision-language models and pixel-wise matching for efficient and accurate product retrieval.

- Experimental results on the ABV dataset show that PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 4.21% in top-1 accuracy while maintaining real-time processing capabilities for practical retail applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.14985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compared to traditional image retrieval tasks, product retrieval in retail settings is even more challenging. Products of the same type from different brands may have highly similar visual appearances, and the query image may be taken from an angle that differs significantly from view angles of the stored catalog images. Foundational models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, often struggle to distinguish these subtle but important local differences. Pixel-wise matching methods, on the other hand, are computationally expensive and incur prohibitively high matching times. In this paper, we propose a new, hybrid method, called PRISM, for product retrieval in retail settings by leveraging the advantages of both vision-language model-based and pixel-wise matching approaches. To provide both efficiency/speed and finegrained retrieval accuracy, PRISM consists of three stages: 1) A vision-language model (SigLIP) is employed first to retrieve the top 35 most semantically similar products from a fixed gallery, thereby narrowing the search space significantly; 2) a segmentation model (YOLO-E) is applied to eliminate background clutter; 3) fine-grained pixel-level matching is performed using LightGlue across the filtered candidates. This framework enables more accurate discrimination between products with high inter-class similarity by focusing on subtle visual cues often missed by global models. Experiments performed on the ABV dataset show that our proposed PRISM outperforms the state-of-the-art image retrieval methods by 4.21% in top-1 accuracy while still remaining within the bounds of real-time processing for practical retail deployments.

Abstract: In recent years, the underwater image formation model has found extensive use in the generation of synthetic underwater data. Although many approaches focus on scenes primarily affected by discoloration, they often overlook the model's ability to capture the complex, distance-dependent visibility loss present in highly turbid environments. In this work, we propose an improved synthetic data generation pipeline that includes the commonly omitted forward scattering term, while also considering a nonuniform medium. Additionally, we collected the BUCKET dataset under controlled turbidity conditions to acquire real turbid footage with the corresponding reference images. Our results demonstrate qualitative improvements over the reference model, particularly under increasing turbidity, with a selection rate of 82. 5\% by survey participants.

<div> framework, brain tumor segmentation, missing-modality scenarios, deep learning, knowledge distillation  
Summary:  
The article introduces AdaMM, a framework for accurate brain tumor segmentation even when modalities are missing. AdaMM consists of three modules: the Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement Module enhances adaptability to missing modalities, the Bi-Bottleneck Distillation Module transfers knowledge between models, and the Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability Module suppresses false positives. AdaMM outperformed existing methods in experiments on BraTS datasets, particularly in single-modality and weak-modality settings. The study also evaluated six missing-modality strategies, highlighting the effectiveness of knowledge distillation. The source code for AdaMM is available on GitHub, providing practical guidance for researchers in the field. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is essential for preoperative evaluation and personalized treatment. Multi-modal MRI is widely used due to its ability to capture complementary tumor features across different sequences. However, in clinical practice, missing modalities are common, limiting the robustness and generalizability of existing deep learning methods that rely on complete inputs, especially under non-dominant modality combinations. To address this, we propose AdaMM, a multi-modal brain tumor segmentation framework tailored for missing-modality scenarios, centered on knowledge distillation and composed of three synergistic modules. The Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement Module explicitly models semantic associations between generalizable and modality-specific features, enhancing adaptability to modality absence. The Bi-Bottleneck Distillation Module transfers structural and textural knowledge from teacher to student models via global style matching and adversarial feature alignment. The Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability Module predicts prior probabilities of lesion types through an auxiliary classification task, effectively suppressing false positives under incomplete inputs. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 and 2024 datasets demonstrate that AdaMM consistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in single-modality and weak-modality configurations. In addition, we conduct a systematic evaluation of six categories of missing-modality strategies, confirming the superiority of knowledge distillation and offering practical guidance for method selection and future research.

<div> Keywords: diffusion models, text-guided image editing, hyperparameter identification, reinforcement learning, Markov Decision Process

Summary:
Recent advancements in diffusion models have transformed text-guided image editing, but the challenge of identifying optimal hyperparameters remains. Traditional methods require users to manually tune multiple interdependent hyperparameters, leading to high computational costs. This study approaches hyperparameter optimization within the diffusion denoising process as a sequential decision-making task. A reinforcement learning framework is proposed, establishing a Markov Decision Process that dynamically adjusts hyperparameters during denoising steps to integrate editing objectives into a reward function. The framework utilizes proximal policy optimization to improve time efficiency while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations. Experimental results show a significant reduction in search time and computational overhead compared to brute-force approaches, facilitating the practical implementation of diffusion-based image editing in real-world applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized text-guided image editing, yet existing editing methods face critical challenges in hyperparameter identification. To get the reasonable editing performance, these methods often require the user to brute-force tune multiple interdependent hyperparameters, such as inversion timesteps and attention modification, \textit{etc.} This process incurs high computational costs due to the huge hyperparameter search space. We consider searching optimal editing's hyperparameters as a sequential decision-making task within the diffusion denoising process. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning framework, which establishes a Markov Decision Process that dynamically adjusts hyperparameters across denoising steps, integrating editing objectives into a reward function. The method achieves time efficiency through proximal policy optimization while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations. Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in search time and computational overhead compared to existing brute-force approaches, advancing the practical deployment of a diffusion-based image editing framework in the real world.

<div> synthetic data, object detection, domain gap, YOLOv11 model, data augmentation
<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper addresses the challenge of the synthetic-to-real domain gap in object detection, specifically focusing on training a YOLOv11 model to detect soup cans using only synthetic data and domain randomization strategies. The study involved extensive experimentation with data augmentation, dataset composition, and model scaling. While synthetic validation metrics were initially high, they did not accurately reflect real-world performance. Models were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively on a manually labeled real-world test set. Key findings highlighted the importance of increasing dataset diversity and including varied perspectives and backgrounds for bridging the domain gap. The best-performing configuration, a YOLOv11l model trained on an expanded and diverse dataset, achieved a final mAP@50 of 0.910 on the competition's hidden test set. This demonstrates the potential of a synthetic-only training approach but also underscores the challenges in capturing real-world variability completely.

Abstract: This paper addresses the synthetic-to-real domain gap in object detection, focusing on training a YOLOv11 model to detect a specific object (a soup can) using only synthetic data and domain randomization strategies. The methodology involves extensive experimentation with data augmentation, dataset composition, and model scaling. While synthetic validation metrics were consistently high, they proved to be poor predictors of real-world performance. Consequently, models were also evaluated qualitatively, through visual inspection of predictions, and quantitatively, on a manually labeled real-world test set, to guide development. Final mAP@50 scores were provided by the official Kaggle competition. Key findings indicate that increasing synthetic dataset diversity, specifically by including varied perspectives and complex backgrounds, combined with carefully tuned data augmentation, were crucial in bridging the domain gap. The best performing configuration, a YOLOv11l model trained on an expanded and diverse dataset, achieved a final mAP@50 of 0.910 on the competition's hidden test set. This result demonstrates the potential of a synthetic-only training approach while also highlighting the remaining challenges in fully capturing real-world variability.

Summary:
- The study evaluated deep learning models for lung segmentation in transplant-eligible patients using chest CT scans.
- Performance of models (Unet-R231, TotalSegmentator, MedSAM) was assessed across disease severity levels and pathology categories.
- Unet-R231 outperformed other models in general, with significant performance declines in moderate-to-severe cases observed for all models.
- No significant differences were found among lung sides or pathology types in model performance.
- Fine-tuning of models, especially in severe pathology contexts, is needed to improve accuracy for preoperative planning in lung transplantation.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This study evaluates publicly available deep-learning based lung segmentation models in transplant-eligible patients to determine their performance across disease severity levels, pathology categories, and lung sides, and to identify limitations impacting their use in preoperative planning in lung transplantation. This retrospective study included 32 patients who underwent chest CT scans at Duke University Health System between 2017 and 2019 (total of 3,645 2D axial slices). Patients with standard axial CT scans were selected based on the presence of two or more lung pathologies of varying severity. Lung segmentation was performed using three previously developed deep learning models: Unet-R231, TotalSegmentator, MedSAM. Performance was assessed using quantitative metrics (volumetric similarity, Dice similarity coefficient, Hausdorff distance) and a qualitative measure (four-point clinical acceptability scale). Unet-R231 consistently outperformed TotalSegmentator and MedSAM in general, for different severity levels, and pathology categories (p<0.05). All models showed significant performance declines from mild to moderate-to-severe cases, particularly in volumetric similarity (p<0.05), without significant differences among lung sides or pathology types. Unet-R231 provided the most accurate automated lung segmentation among evaluated models with TotalSegmentator being a close second, though their performance declined significantly in moderate-to-severe cases, emphasizing the need for specialized model fine-tuning in severe pathology contexts.

Abstract: Recent research on representation learning has proved the merits of multi-modal clues for robust semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, a flexible pretrain-and-finetune pipeline for multiple visual modalities remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal learning framework, termed OmniSegmentor. It has two key innovations: 1) Based on ImageNet, we assemble a large-scale dataset for multi-modal pretraining, called ImageNeXt, which contains five popular visual modalities. 2) We provide an efficient pretraining manner to endow the model with the capacity to encode different modality information in the ImageNeXt. For the first time, we introduce a universal multi-modal pretraining framework that consistently amplifies the model's perceptual capabilities across various scenarios, regardless of the arbitrary combination of the involved modalities. Remarkably, our OmniSegmentor achieves new state-of-the-art records on a wide range of multi-modal semantic segmentation datasets, including NYU Depthv2, EventScape, MFNet, DeLiVER, SUNRGBD, and KITTI-360.

<title>RGB-Only Supervised Camera Parameter Optimization in Dynamic Scenes</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15123</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.15123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although COLMAP has long remained the predominant method for camera parameter optimization in static scenes, it is constrained by its lengthy runtime and reliance on ground truth (GT) motion masks for application to dynamic scenes. Many efforts attempted to improve it by incorporating more priors as supervision such as GT focal length, motion masks, 3D point clouds, camera poses, and metric depth, which, however, are typically unavailable in casually captured RGB videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate and efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised by a single RGB video. Our method consists of three key components: (1) Patch-wise Tracking Filters, to establish robust and maximally sparse hinge-like relations across the RGB video. (2) Outlier-aware Joint Optimization, for efficient camera parameter optimization by adaptive down-weighting of moving outliers, without reliance on motion priors. (3) A Two-stage Optimization Strategy, to enhance stability and optimization speed by a trade-off between the Softplus limits and convex minima in losses. We visually and numerically evaluate our camera estimates. To further validate accuracy, we feed the camera estimates into a 4D reconstruction method and assess the resulting 3D scenes, and rendered 2D RGB and depth maps. We perform experiments on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, and TUM-dynamics) and 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel), demonstrating that our method estimates camera parameters more efficiently and accurately with a single RGB video as the only supervision.

Abstract: Ensuring factual consistency and reliable reasoning remains a critical challenge for medical vision-language models. We introduce MEDFACT-R1, a two-stage framework that integrates external knowledge grounding with reinforcement learning to improve the factual medical reasoning. The first stage uses pseudo-label supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to incorporate external factual expertise; while the second stage applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with four tailored factual reward signals to encourage self-consistent reasoning. Across three public medical QA benchmarks, MEDFACT-R1 delivers up to 22.5% absolute improvement in factual accuracy over previous state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the necessity of pseudo-label SFT cold start and validate the contribution of each GRPO reward, underscoring the synergy between knowledge grounding and RL-driven reasoning for trustworthy medical AI. Codes are released at https://github.com/Garfieldgengliang/MEDFACT-R1.

<title>Leveraging Geometric Visual Illusions as Perceptual Inductive Biases for Vision Models</title>

arXiv:2509.15156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary deep learning models have achieved impressive performance in image classification by primarily leveraging statistical regularities within large datasets, but they rarely incorporate structured insights drawn directly from perceptual psychology. To explore the potential of perceptually motivated inductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions well-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification training pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric geometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies that combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification objectives. Our experiments reveal two key conceptual insights: (i) incorporating geometric illusions as auxiliary supervision systematically improves generalization, especially in visually challenging cases involving intricate contours and fine textures; and (ii) perceptually driven inductive biases, even when derived from synthetic stimuli traditionally considered unrelated to natural image recognition, can enhance the structural sensitivity of both CNN and transformer-based architectures. These results demonstrate a novel integration of perceptual science and machine learning and suggest new directions for embedding perceptual priors into vision model design.

<title>AIP: Subverting Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Adversarial Instructional Prompt</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15159</link>

arXiv:2509.15159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from external sources to improve factual accuracy and verifiability. However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within the retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have exposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries, which is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs. This narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional prompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their implicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG behavior covertly.
  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that exploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly altering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the instructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface components can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted to achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility, to encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across diverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that simulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the discovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings. Building on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to evolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and stealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR while preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and previously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to reassess the shared instructional prompts.

<title>Semi-Supervised 3D Medical Segmentation from 2D Natural Images Pretrained Model</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.15167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the transfer of knowledge from general vision models pretrained on 2D natural images to improve 3D medical image segmentation. We focus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical images are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle this, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills knowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from scratch. Our approach, M&amp;N, involves iterative co-training of the two models using pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning rate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and unlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction accuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets demonstrate that M&amp;N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming thirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different settings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&amp;N remains model-agnostic, allowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its adaptability as more advanced models emerge.

<title>A Race Bias Free Face Aging Model for Reliable Kinship Verification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.15177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The age gap in kinship verification addresses the time difference between the photos of the parent and the child. Moreover, their same-age photos are often unavailable, and face aging models are racially biased, which impacts the likeness of photos. Therefore, we propose a face aging GAN model, RA-GAN, consisting of two new modules, RACEpSp and a feature mixer, to produce racially unbiased images. The unbiased synthesized photos are used in kinship verification to investigate the results of verifying same-age parent-child images. The experiments demonstrate that our RA-GAN outperforms SAM-GAN on an average of 13.14\% across all age groups, and CUSP-GAN in the 60+ age group by 9.1\% in terms of racial accuracy. Moreover, RA-GAN can preserve subjects' identities better than SAM-GAN and CUSP-GAN across all age groups. Additionally, we demonstrate that transforming parent and child images from the KinFaceW-I and KinFaceW-II datasets to the same age can enhance the verification accuracy across all age groups. The accuracy increases with our RA-GAN for the kinship relationships of father-son and father-daughter, mother-son, and mother-daughter, which are 5.22, 5.12, 1.63, and 0.41, respectively, on KinFaceW-I. Additionally, the accuracy for the relationships of father-daughter, father-son, and mother-son is 2.9, 0.39, and 1.6 on KinFaceW-II, respectively.

<title>Unleashing the Potential of Multimodal LLMs for Zero-Shot Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15178</link>

arXiv:2509.15178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal tube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we utilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot solution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to dynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \textit{grounding tokens}, for grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal grounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query (\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we propose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel decomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented assembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH strategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action sub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and temporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to learn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token predictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action cues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and temporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the attribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS strategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the temporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We evaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods on three common STVG benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate maize seedling detection is crucial for precision agriculture, yet curated datasets remain scarce. We introduce MSDD, a high-quality aerial image dataset for maize seedling stand counting, with applications in early-season crop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management. Stand counting determines how many plants germinated, guiding timely decisions such as replanting or adjusting inputs. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and error-prone, while computer vision enables efficient, accurate detection. MSDD contains three classes-single, double, and triple plants-capturing diverse growth stages, planting setups, soil types, lighting conditions, camera angles, and densities, ensuring robustness for real-world use. Benchmarking shows detection is most reliable during V4-V6 stages and under nadir views. Among tested models, YOLO11 is fastest, while YOLOv9 yields the highest accuracy for single plants. Single plant detection achieves precision up to 0.984 and recall up to 0.873, but detecting doubles and triples remains difficult due to rarity and irregular appearance, often from planting errors. Class imbalance further reduces accuracy in multi-plant detection. Despite these challenges, YOLO11 maintains efficient inference at 35 ms per image, with an additional 120 ms for saving outputs. MSDD establishes a strong foundation for developing models that enhance stand counting, optimize resource allocation, and support real-time decision-making. This dataset marks a step toward automating agricultural monitoring and advancing precision agriculture.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of high-quality visual representations in image generation and have highlighted the limitations of generative models in image understanding. As a generative paradigm originally designed for natural language, autoregressive models face similar challenges. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the mechanisms of applying the next-token prediction paradigm to the visual domain. We identify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual semantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency, and spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively addressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to a novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models (ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR significantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models and leads to improved generation quality. Specifically, ST-AR brings approximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% FID improvement for LlamaGen-XL, while maintaining the same sampling strategy.

Abstract: Synchronization is the task of estimating and inverting geometric transformations (e.g., crop, rotation) applied to an image. This work introduces SyncSeal, a bespoke watermarking method for robust image synchronization, which can be applied on top of existing watermarking methods to enhance their robustness against geometric transformations. It relies on an embedder network that imperceptibly alters images and an extractor network that predicts the geometric transformation to which the image was subjected. Both networks are end-to-end trained to minimize the error between the predicted and ground-truth parameters of the transformation, combined with a discriminator to maintain high perceptual quality. We experimentally validate our method on a wide variety of geometric and valuemetric transformations, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately synchronizing images. We further show that our synchronization can effectively upgrade existing watermarking methods to withstand geometric transformations to which they were previously vulnerable.

Abstract: This paper presents RynnVLA-001, a vision-language-action(VLA) model built upon large-scale video generative pretraining from human demonstrations. We propose a novel two-stage pretraining methodology. The first stage, Ego-Centric Video Generative Pretraining, trains an Image-to-Video model on 12M ego-centric manipulation videos to predict future frames conditioned on an initial frame and a language instruction. The second stage, Human-Centric Trajectory-Aware Modeling, extends this by jointly predicting future keypoint trajectories, thereby effectively bridging visual frame prediction with action prediction. Furthermore, to enhance action representation, we propose ActionVAE, a variational autoencoder that compresses sequences of actions into compact latent embeddings, reducing the complexity of the VLA output space. When finetuned on the same downstream robotics datasets, RynnVLA-001 achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that the proposed pretraining strategy provides a more effective initialization for VLA models.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical task in computer vision and autonomous systems, playing a key role in autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual reality. Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free observational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight objects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera coverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised trajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable prediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present advancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the noise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data. Building on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight Trajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending its applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual reality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera calibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of visual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an unsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory denoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines. Additionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such as Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task, providing a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative to integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor trajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances.

Abstract: To reconstruct the 3D geometry from calibrated images, learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods typically perform multi-view depth estimation and then fuse depth maps into a mesh or point cloud. To improve the computational efficiency, many methods initialize a coarse depth map and then gradually refine it in higher resolutions. Recently, diffusion models achieve great success in generation tasks. Starting from a random noise, diffusion models gradually recover the sample with an iterative denoising process. In this paper, we propose a novel MVS framework, which introduces diffusion models in MVS. Specifically, we formulate depth refinement as a conditional diffusion process. Considering the discriminative characteristic of depth estimation, we design a condition encoder to guide the diffusion process. To improve efficiency, we propose a novel diffusion network combining lightweight 2D U-Net and convolutional GRU. Moreover, we propose a novel confidence-based sampling strategy to adaptively sample depth hypotheses based on the confidence estimated by diffusion model. Based on our novel MVS framework, we propose two novel MVS methods, DiffMVS and CasDiffMVS. DiffMVS achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art efficiency in run-time and GPU memory. CasDiffMVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on DTU, Tanks & Temples and ETH3D. Code is available at: https://github.com/cvg/diffmvs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled computer use agents (CUAs) that operate GUIs autonomously, showing great potential, yet progress is limited by the lack of large-scale, open-source computer use data and foundation models. In this work, we introduce ScaleCUA, a step toward scaling open-source CUAs. It offers a large-scale dataset spanning 6 operating systems and 3 task domains, built via a closed-loop pipeline uniting automated agents with human experts. Trained on this scaled-up data, ScaleCUA can operate seamlessly across platforms. Specifically, it delivers strong gains over baselines (+26.6 on WebArena-Lite-v2, +10.7 on ScreenSpot-Pro) and sets new state-of-the-art results (94.4% on MMBench-GUI L1-Hard, 60.6% on OSWorld-G, 47.4% on WebArena-Lite-v2). These findings underscore the power of data-driven scaling for general-purpose computer use agents. We will release data, models, and code to advance future research: https://github.com/OpenGVLab/ScaleCUA.

Abstract: Event cameras capture sparse, high-temporal-resolution visual information, making them particularly suitable for challenging environments with high-speed motion and strongly varying lighting conditions. However, the lack of large datasets with dense ground-truth depth annotations hinders learning-based monocular depth estimation from event data. To address this limitation, we propose a cross-modal distillation paradigm to generate dense proxy labels leveraging a Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Our strategy requires an event stream spatially aligned with RGB frames, a simple setup even available off-the-shelf, and exploits the robustness of large-scale VFMs. Additionally, we propose to adapt VFMs, either a vanilla one like Depth Anything v2 (DAv2), or deriving from it a novel recurrent architecture to infer depth from monocular event cameras. We evaluate our approach with synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that i) our cross-modal paradigm achieves competitive performance compared to fully supervised methods without requiring expensive depth annotations, and ii) our VFM-based models achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We introduce VocAlign, a novel source-free domain adaptation framework specifically designed for VLMs in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. Our method adopts a student-teacher paradigm enhanced with a vocabulary alignment strategy, which improves pseudo-label generation by incorporating additional class concepts. To ensure efficiency, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the model, preserving its original capabilities while minimizing computational overhead. In addition, we propose a Top-K class selection mechanism for the student model, which significantly reduces memory requirements while further improving adaptation performance. Our approach achieves a notable 6.11 mIoU improvement on the CityScapes dataset and demonstrates superior performance on zero-shot segmentation benchmarks, setting a new standard for source-free adaptation in the open-vocabulary setting.

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse medical imaging tasks by leveraging large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their confidence calibration is largely unexplored, and so remains a significant challenge. As such, miscalibrated predictions can lead to overconfident errors, undermining clinical trust and decision-making reliability. To address this, we introduce CalibPrompt, the first framework to calibrate Med-VLMs during prompt tuning. CalibPrompt optimizes a small set of learnable prompts with carefully designed calibration objectives under scarce labeled data regime. First, we study a regularizer that attempts to align the smoothed accuracy with the predicted model confidences. Second, we introduce an angular separation loss to maximize textual feature proximity toward improving the reliability in confidence estimates of multimodal Med-VLMs. Extensive experiments on four publicly available Med-VLMs and five diverse medical imaging datasets reveal that CalibPrompt consistently improves calibration without drastically affecting clean accuracy. Our code is available at https://github.com/iabh1shekbasu/CalibPrompt.

<title>RLBind: Adversarial-Invariant Cross-Modal Alignment for Unified Robust Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Unified multi-modal encoders that bind vision, audio, and other sensors into a shared embedding space are attractive building blocks for robot perception and decision-making. However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to adversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for safety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within CLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding modest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a two-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust unified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on clean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages cross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between clean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise distributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image, Audio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the LanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy and norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without sacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer multi-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation, and other autonomy settings.

<title>One-step Multi-view Clustering With Adaptive Low-rank Anchor-graph Learning</title>

Abstract: In light of their capability to capture structural information while reducing computing complexity, anchor graph-based multi-view clustering (AGMC) methods have attracted considerable attention in large-scale clustering problems. Nevertheless, existing AGMC methods still face the following two issues: 1) They directly embedded diverse anchor graphs into a consensus anchor graph (CAG), and hence ignore redundant information and numerous noises contained in these anchor graphs, leading to a decrease in clustering effectiveness; 2) They drop effectiveness and efficiency due to independent post-processing to acquire clustering indicators. To overcome the aforementioned issues, we deliver a novel one-step multi-view clustering method with adaptive low-rank anchor-graph learning (OMCAL). To construct a high-quality CAG, OMCAL provides a nuclear norm-based adaptive CAG learning model against information redundancy and noise interference. Then, to boost clustering effectiveness and efficiency substantially, we incorporate category indicator acquisition and CAG learning into a unified framework. Numerous studies conducted on ordinary and large-scale datasets indicate that OMCAL outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of clustering effectiveness and efficiency.

Abstract: Ensuring safety of vision-based control systems remains a major challenge hindering their deployment in critical settings. Safety filters have gained increased interest as effective tools for ensuring the safety of classical control systems, but their applications in vision-based control settings have so far been limited. Pre-trained vision models (PVRs) have been shown to be effective perception backbones for control in various robotics domains. In this paper, we are interested in examining their effectiveness when used for designing vision-based safety filters. We use them as backbones for classifiers defining failure sets, for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based safety filters, and for latent world models. We discuss the trade-offs between training from scratch, fine-tuning, and freezing the PVRs when training the models they are backbones for. We also evaluate whether one of the PVRs is superior across all tasks, evaluate whether learned world models or Q-functions are better for switching decisions to safe policies, and discuss practical considerations for deploying these PVRs on resource-constrained devices.

<title>M4Diffuser: Multi-View Diffusion Policy with Manipulability-Aware Control for Robust Mobile Manipulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.14980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile manipulation requires the coordinated control of a mobile base and a robotic arm while simultaneously perceiving both global scene context and fine-grained object details. Existing single-view approaches often fail in unstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and generalization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable, struggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address these challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a Multi-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP (ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages proprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both close-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant end-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed by the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational efficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness near singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world environments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates and reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach demonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong generalization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation in unstructured environments. Details of the demo and supplemental material are available on our project website https://sites.google.com/view/m4diffuser.

Abstract: Medical decision-making often involves integrating knowledge from multiple clinical specialties, typically achieved through multidisciplinary teams. Inspired by this collaborative process, recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent collaboration frameworks to emulate expert teamwork. While these approaches improve reasoning through agent interaction, they are limited by static, pre-assigned roles, which hinder adaptability and dynamic knowledge integration. To address these limitations, we propose KAMAC, a Knowledge-driven Adaptive Multi-Agent Collaboration framework that enables LLM agents to dynamically form and expand expert teams based on the evolving diagnostic context. KAMAC begins with one or more expert agents and then conducts a knowledge-driven discussion to identify and fill knowledge gaps by recruiting additional specialists as needed. This supports flexible, scalable collaboration in complex clinical scenarios, with decisions finalized through reviewing updated agent comments. Experiments on two real-world medical benchmarks demonstrate that KAMAC significantly outperforms both single-agent and advanced multi-agent methods, particularly in complex clinical scenarios (i.e., cancer prognosis) requiring dynamic, cross-specialty expertise. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/XiaoXiao-Woo/KAMAC.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient Split Learning (SL) framework, named Attention-based Double Compression (ADC), which reduces the communication overhead required for transmitting intermediate Vision Transformers activations during the SL training process. ADC incorporates two parallel compression strategies. The first one merges samples' activations that are similar, based on the average attention score calculated in the last client layer; this strategy is class-agnostic, meaning that it can also merge samples having different classes, without losing generalization ability nor decreasing final results. The second strategy follows the first and discards the least meaningful tokens, further reducing the communication cost. Combining these strategies not only allows for sending less during the forward pass, but also the gradients are naturally compressed, allowing the whole model to be trained without additional tuning or approximations of the gradients. Simulation results demonstrate that Attention-based Double Compression outperforms state-of-the-art SL frameworks by significantly reducing communication overheads while maintaining high accuracy.

Abstract: Images play a vital role in improving the readability and comprehension of Wikipedia articles by serving as `illustrative aids.' However, not all images are equally effective and not all Wikipedia editors are trained in their selection. We propose QuizRank, a novel method of image selection that leverages large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) to rank images as learning interventions. Our approach transforms textual descriptions of the article's subject into multiple-choice questions about important visual characteristics of the concept. We utilize these questions to quiz the VLM: the better an image can help answer questions, the higher it is ranked. To further improve discrimination between visually similar items, we introduce a Contrastive QuizRank that leverages differences in the features of target (e.g., a Western Bluebird) and distractor concepts (e.g., Mountain Bluebird) to generate questions. We demonstrate the potential of VLMs as effective visual evaluators by showing a high congruence with human quiz-takers and an effective discriminative ranking of images.

Abstract: Air pollution remains a critical threat to public health and environmental sustainability, yet conventional monitoring systems are often constrained by limited spatial coverage and accessibility. This paper proposes an AI-driven agent that predicts ambient air pollution levels from sky images and synthesizes realistic visualizations of pollution scenarios using generative modeling. Our approach combines statistical texture analysis with supervised learning for pollution classification, and leverages vision-language model (VLM)-guided image generation to produce interpretable representations of air quality conditions. The generated visuals simulate varying degrees of pollution, offering a foundation for user-facing interfaces that improve transparency and support informed environmental decision-making. These outputs can be seamlessly integrated into intelligent applications aimed at enhancing situational awareness and encouraging behavioral responses based on real-time forecasts. We validate our method using a dataset of urban sky images and demonstrate its effectiveness in both pollution level estimation and semantically consistent visual synthesis. The system design further incorporates human-centered user experience principles to ensure accessibility, clarity, and public engagement in air quality forecasting. To support scalable and energy-efficient deployment, future iterations will incorporate a green CNN architecture enhanced with FPGA-based incremental learning, enabling real-time inference on edge platforms.

Abstract: Modelling the underlying mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases demands methods that capture heterogeneous and spatially varying dynamics from sparse, high-dimensional neuroimaging data. Integrating partial differential equation (PDE) based physics knowledge with machine learning provides enhanced interpretability and utility over classic numerical methods. However, current physics-integrated machine learning methods are limited to considering a single PDE, severely limiting their application to diseases where multiple mechanisms are responsible for different groups (i.e., subtypes) and aggravating problems with model misspecification and degeneracy. Here, we present a deep generative model for learning mixtures of latent dynamic models governed by physics-based PDEs, going beyond traditional approaches that assume a single PDE structure. Our method integrates reaction-diffusion PDEs within a variational autoencoder (VAE) mixture model framework, supporting inference of subtypes of interpretable latent variables (e.g. diffusivity and reaction rates) from neuroimaging data. We evaluate our method on synthetic benchmarks and demonstrate its potential for uncovering mechanistic subtypes of Alzheimer's disease progression from positron emission tomography (PET) data.

Abstract: With the IEEE 802.11bf Task Group introducing amendments to the WLAN standard for advanced sensing, interest in using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI) for remote sensing has surged. Recent findings indicate that learning a unified three-dimensional motion representation through Doppler Radiance Fields (DoRFs) derived from CSI significantly improves the generalization capabilities of Wi-Fi-based human activity recognition (HAR). Despite this progress, CSI signals remain affected by asynchronous access point (AP) clocks and additive noise from environmental and hardware sources. Consequently, even with existing preprocessing techniques, both the CSI data and Doppler velocity projections used in DoRFs are still susceptible to noise and outliers, limiting HAR performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for multi-antenna APs to suppress noise and identify the most informative antennas based on DoRF fitting errors, which capture inconsistencies among Doppler velocity projections. Experimental results on a challenging small-scale hand gesture recognition dataset demonstrate that the proposed DoRF-guided Wi-Fi-based HAR approach significantly improves generalization capability, paving the way for robust real-world sensing deployments.

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models demonstrate strong potential in spatial intelligence tasks due to their rich latent world priors. However, this potential is hindered by their limited controllability and geometric inconsistency, creating a gap between their strong priors and their practical use in 3D/4D tasks. As a result, current approaches often rely on retraining or fine-tuning, which risks degrading pretrained knowledge and incurs high computational costs. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free, inference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. Intra-Step Recursive Refinement introduces a recursive refinement mechanism during inference, which repeatedly optimizes network predictions within each denoising step to enable precise trajectory injection. Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages optical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space and selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels. Dual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths to adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural signals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned guidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and photorealistic content generation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks validate our method's superiority in realism, trajectory consistency, and visual fidelity. This work introduces a novel plug-and-play paradigm for controllable video synthesis, offering a new perspective on leveraging generative priors for spatial intelligence.

Abstract: This paper shows how a multimodal large language model (MLLM) can expand urban measurement capacity and support tracking of place-based policy interventions. Using a structured, reason-then-estimate pipeline on street-view imagery, GPT-4o infers neighborhood poverty and tree canopy, which we embed in a quasi-experimental design evaluating the legacy of 1930s redlining. GPT-4o recovers the expected adverse socio-environmental legacy effects of redlining, with estimates statistically indistinguishable from authoritative sources, and it outperforms a conventional pixel-based segmentation baseline-consistent with the idea that holistic scene reasoning extracts higher-order information beyond object counts alone. These results position MLLMs as policy-grade instruments for neighborhood measurement and motivate broader validation across policy-evaluation settings.

A key challenge stems from the lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric images. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically fail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this paper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation pipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized from 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from mathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key features of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization and yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, even in out-of-distribution scenarios, the generated dataset enhances the general reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models, yielding accuracy improvements of $2.8\%\text{-}4.8\%$ in statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks with non-geometric input images of MathVista and MathVerse, along with $2.4\%\text{-}3.9\%$ improvements in Art, Design, Tech, and Engineering tasks in MMMU.

Abstract: Piano performance is a multimodal activity that intrinsically combines physical actions with the acoustic rendition. Despite growing research interest in analyzing the multimodal nature of piano performance, the laborious process of acquiring large-scale multimodal data remains a significant bottleneck, hindering further progress in this field. To overcome this barrier, we present an integrated web toolkit comprising two graphical user interfaces (GUIs): (i) PiaRec, which supports the synchronized acquisition of audio, video, MIDI, and performance metadata. (ii) ASDF, which enables the efficient annotation of performer fingering from the visual data. Collectively, this system can streamline the acquisition of multimodal piano performance datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework for Interactive Face Video Coding (IFVC), which allows humans to interact with the intrinsic visual representations instead of the signals. The proposed solution enjoys several distinct advantages, including ultra-compact representation, low delay interaction, and vivid expression/headpose animation. In particular, we propose the Internal Dimension Increase (IDI) based representation, greatly enhancing the fidelity and flexibility in rendering the appearance while maintaining reasonable representation cost. By leveraging strong statistical regularities, the visual signals can be effectively projected into controllable semantics in the three dimensional space (e.g., mouth motion, eye blinking, head rotation, head translation and head location), which are compressed and transmitted. The editable bitstream, which naturally supports the interactivity at the semantic level, can synthesize the face frames via the strong inference ability of the deep generative model. Experimental results have demonstrated the performance superiority and application prospects of our proposed IFVC scheme. In particular, the proposed scheme not only outperforms the state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) and the latest generative compression schemes in terms of rate-distortion performance for face videos, but also enables the interactive coding without introducing additional manipulation processes. Furthermore, the proposed framework is expected to shed lights on the future design of the digital human communication in the metaverse.

<title>Image Super-Resolution Reconstruction Network based on Enhanced Swin Transformer via Alternating Aggregation of Local-Global Features</title>

Abstract: The Swin Transformer image super-resolution (SR) reconstruction network primarily depends on the long-range relationship of the window and shifted window attention to explore features. However, this approach focuses only on global features, ignoring local ones, and considers only spatial interactions, disregarding channel and spatial-channel feature interactions, limiting its nonlinear mapping capability. Therefore, this study proposes an enhanced Swin Transformer network (ESTN) that alternately aggregates local and global features. During local feature aggregation, shift convolution facilitates the interaction between local spatial and channel information. During global feature aggregation, a block sparse global perception module is introduced, wherein spatial information is reorganized and the recombined features are then processed by a dense layer to achieve global perception. Additionally, multiscale self-attention and low-parameter residual channel attention modules are introduced to aggregate information across different scales. Finally, the effectiveness of ESTN on five public datasets and a local attribution map (LAM) are analyzed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ESTN achieves higher average PSNR, surpassing SRCNN, ELAN-light, SwinIR-light, and SMFANER+ models by 2.17dB, 0.13dB, 0.12dB, and 0.1dB, respectively, with LAM further confirming its larger receptive field. ESTN delivers improved quality of SR images. The source code can be found at https://github.com/huangyuming2021/ESTN.

Abstract: With the continuous expansion of intelligent surveillance networks, lifelong person re-identification (LReID) has received widespread attention, pursuing the need of self-evolution across different domains. However, existing LReID studies accumulate knowledge with the assumption that people would not change their clothes. In this paper, we propose a more practical task, namely lifelong person re-identification with hybrid clothing states (LReID-Hybrid), which takes a series of cloth-changing and same-cloth domains into account during lifelong learning. To tackle the challenges of knowledge granularity mismatch and knowledge presentation mismatch in LReID-Hybrid, we take advantage of the consistency and generalization capabilities of the text space, and propose a novel framework, dubbed $Teata$, to effectively align, transfer, and accumulate knowledge in an "image-text-image" closed loop. Concretely, to achieve effective knowledge transfer, we design a Structured Semantic Prompt (SSP) learning to decompose the text prompt into several structured pairs to distill knowledge from the image space with a unified granularity of text description. Then, we introduce a Knowledge Adaptation and Projection (KAP) strategy, which tunes text knowledge via a slow-paced learner to adapt to different tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed $Teata$ for LReID-Hybrid as well as on conventional LReID benchmarks over advanced methods.

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as powerful tools across various domains including language, vision, and multimodal tasks. While prior works have addressed unsupervised image segmentation, they significantly lag behind supervised models. In this paper, we use a diffusion UNet encoder as a foundation vision encoder and introduce DiffCut, an unsupervised zero-shot segmentation method that solely harnesses the output features from the final self-attention block. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the utilization of these diffusion features in a graph based segmentation algorithm, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot segmentation. Specifically, we leverage a recursive Normalized Cut algorithm that softly regulates the granularity of detected objects and produces well-defined segmentation maps that precisely capture intricate image details. Our work highlights the remarkably accurate semantic knowledge embedded within diffusion UNet encoders that could then serve as foundation vision encoders for downstream tasks.

Abstract: We address the problem of estimating the relative 6D pose, i.e., position and orientation, of a target spacecraft, from a monocular image, a key capability for future autonomous Rendezvous and Proximity Operations. Due to the difficulty of acquiring large sets of real images, spacecraft pose estimation networks are exclusively trained on synthetic ones. However, because those images do not capture the illumination conditions encountered in orbit, pose estimation networks face a domain gap problem, i.e., they do not generalize to real images. Our work introduces a method that bridges this domain gap. It relies on a novel, end-to-end, neural-based architecture as well as a novel learning strategy. This strategy improves the domain generalization abilities of the network through multi-task learning and aggressive data augmentation policies, thereby enforcing the network to learn domain-invariant features. We demonstrate that our method effectively closes the domain gap, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the widespread SPEED+ dataset. Finally, ablation studies assess the impact of key components of our method on its generalization abilities.

Abstract: Recently, driven by advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), Vision Language Action Models (VLAMs) are being proposed to achieve better performance in open-vocabulary scenarios for robotic manipulation tasks. Since manipulation tasks involve direct interaction with the physical world, ensuring robustness and safety during the execution of this task is always a very critical issue. In this paper, by synthesizing current safety research on MLLMs and the specific application scenarios of the manipulation task in the physical world, we comprehensively evaluate VLAMs in the face of potential physical threats. Specifically, we propose the Physical Vulnerability Evaluating Pipeline (PVEP) that can incorporate as many visual modal physical threats as possible for evaluating the physical robustness of VLAMs. The physical threats in PVEP specifically include Out-of-Distribution, Typography-based Visual Prompt, and Adversarial Patch Attacks. By comparing the performance fluctuations of VLAMs before and after being attacked, we provide generalizable \textbf{\textit{Analyses}} of how VLAMs respond to different physical threats.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Generative Face Video Compression (GFVC) approach using Supplemental Enhancement Information (SEI), where a series of compact spatial and temporal representations of a face video signal (e.g., 2D/3D keypoints, facial semantics and compact features) can be coded using SEI messages and inserted into the coded video bitstream. At the time of writing, the proposed GFVC approach using SEI messages has been included into a draft amendment of the Versatile Supplemental Enhancement Information (VSEI) standard by the Joint Video Experts Team (JVET) of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29 and ITU-T SG21, which will be standardized as a new version of ITU-T H.274 | ISO/IEC 23002-7. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the JVET work on the proposed SEI-based GFVC approach is the first standardization activity for generative video compression. The proposed SEI approach has not only advanced the reconstruction quality of early-day Model-Based Coding (MBC) via the state-of-the-art generative technique, but also established a new SEI definition for future GFVC applications and deployment. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed SEI-based GFVC approach can achieve remarkable rate-distortion performance compared with the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard, whilst also potentially enabling a wide variety of functionalities including user-specified animation/filtering and metaverse-related applications.

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Functions (UDFs) can be used to represent non-watertight surfaces in a deep learning framework. However, UDFs tend to be brittle and difficult to learn, in part because the surface is located exactly where the UDF is non-differentiable. In this work, we show that Gradient Distance Functions (GDFs) can remedy this by being differentiable at the surface while still being able to represent open surfaces. This is done by associating to each 3D point a 3D vector whose norm is taken to be the unsigned distance to the surface and whose orientation is taken to be the direction towards the closest surface point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GDFs on ShapeNet Car, Multi-Garment, and 3D-Scene datasets with both single-shape reconstruction networks or categorical auto-decoders.

Abstract: Large Multi-Modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities as general-purpose chatbots able to engage in conversations about visual inputs. However, their responses are influenced by societal biases present in their training datasets, leading to undesirable differences in how the model responds when presented with images depicting people of different demographics. In this work, we propose a training-free debiasing framework for LMMs that intervenes on the model's representations during text generation by constructing a steering vector that reduces reference on protected attributes. Our framework introduces two complementary methods: (1) a dataset-based approach that constructs a steering vector by contrasting model activations on biased and neutral inputs, and (2) a novel optimization-based approach designed for low-resource settings, which constructs the steering vector using a single step of gradient-based perturbation without requiring additional data. Our experiments show that these interventions effectively reduce the propensity of LMMs to generate text related to protected attributes while maintaining sentiment and fluency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that debiased LMMs achieve comparable accuracy to their unmodified counterparts on downstream tasks, indicating that bias mitigation can be achieved without sacrificing model performance.

Abstract: Human motion generation has been widely studied due to its crucial role in areas such as digital humans and humanoid robot control. However, many current motion generation approaches disregard physics constraints, frequently resulting in physically implausible motions with pronounced artifacts such as floating and foot sliding. Meanwhile, training an effective motion physics optimizer with noisy motion data remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Morph}, a \textbf{Mo}tion-F\textbf{r}ee \textbf{ph}ysics optimization framework, consisting of a Motion Generator and a Motion Physics Refinement module, for enhancing physical plausibility without relying on expensive real-world motion data. Specifically, the motion generator is responsible for providing large-scale synthetic, noisy motion data, while the motion physics refinement module utilizes these synthetic data to learn a motion imitator within a physics simulator, enforcing physical constraints to project the noisy motions into a physically-plausible space. Additionally, we introduce a prior reward module to enhance the stability of the physics optimization process and generate smoother and more stable motions. These physically refined motions are then used to fine-tune the motion generator, further enhancing its capability. This collaborative training paradigm enables mutual enhancement between the motion generator and the motion physics refinement module, significantly improving practicality and robustness in real-world applications. Experiments on both text-to-motion and music-to-dance generation tasks demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art motion quality while improving physical plausibility drastically.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) lead to significant breakthroughs in both academia and industry. One question that arises is how we, as humans, can understand their internal neural representations. This paper takes an initial step towards addressing this question by presenting a versatile framework to identify and interpret the semantics within LMMs. Specifically, 1) we first apply a Sparse Autoencoder(SAE) to disentangle the representations into human understandable features. 2) We then present an automatic interpretation framework to interpreted the open-semantic features learned in SAE by the LMMs themselves. We employ this framework to analyze the LLaVA-NeXT-8B model using the LLaVA-OV-72B model, demonstrating that these features can effectively steer the model's behavior. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of why LMMs excel in specific tasks, including EQ tests, and illuminate the nature of their mistakes along with potential strategies for their rectification. These findings offer new insights into the internal mechanisms of LMMs and suggest parallels with the cognitive processes of the human brain.

Abstract: In this paper, we present DM-Calib, a diffusion-based approach for estimating pinhole camera intrinsic parameters from a single input image. Monocular camera calibration is essential for many 3D vision tasks. However, most existing methods depend on handcrafted assumptions or are constrained by limited training data, resulting in poor generalization across diverse real-world images. Recent advancements in stable diffusion models, trained on massive data, have shown the ability to generate high-quality images with varied characteristics. Emerging evidence indicates that these models implicitly capture the relationship between camera focal length and image content. Building on this insight, we explore how to leverage the powerful priors of diffusion models for monocular pinhole camera calibration. Specifically, we introduce a new image-based representation, termed Camera Image, which losslessly encodes the numerical camera intrinsics and integrates seamlessly with the diffusion framework. Using this representation, we reformulate the problem of estimating camera intrinsics as the generation of a dense Camera Image conditioned on an input image. By fine-tuning a stable diffusion model to generate a Camera Image from a single RGB input, we can extract camera intrinsics via a RANSAC operation. We further demonstrate that our monocular calibration method enhances performance across various 3D tasks, including zero-shot metric depth estimation, 3D metrology, pose estimation and sparse-view reconstruction. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms baselines and provides broad benefits to 3D vision tasks.

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible (IR-VIS) methods inherit the general representations of Pre-trained Visual Models (PVMs) to facilitate complementary learning. However, our analysis indicates that under the full fine-tuning paradigm, the feature space becomes highly constrained and low-ranked, which has been proven to seriously impair generalization. One solution is freezing parameters to preserve pre-trained knowledge and thus maintain diversity of the feature space. To this end, we propose IV-tuning, to parameter-efficiently harness PVMs for various IR-VIS downstream tasks, including salient object detection, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Compared with the full fine-tuning baselines and existing IR-VIS methods, IV-tuning facilitates the learning of complementary information between infrared and visible modalities with less than 3% of the backbone parameters, and effectively alleviates the overfitting problem. The code is available in https://github.com/Yummy198913/IV-tuning.

Abstract: In image generation, Multiple Latent Variable Generative Models (MLVGMs) employ multiple latent variables to gradually shape the final images, from global characteristics to finer and local details (e.g., StyleGAN, NVAE), emerging as powerful tools for diverse applications. Yet their generative dynamics remain only empirically observed, without a systematic understanding of each latent variable's impact.
  In this work, we propose a novel framework that quantifies the contribution of each latent variable using Mutual Information (MI) as a metric. Our analysis reveals that current MLVGMs often underutilize some latent variables, and provides actionable insights for their use in downstream applications. With this foundation, we introduce a method for generating synthetic data for Self-Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning (SSCRL). By leveraging the hierarchical and disentangled variables of MLVGMs, our approach produces diverse and semantically meaningful views without the need for real image data.
  Additionally, we introduce a Continuous Sampling (CS) strategy, where the generator dynamically creates new samples during SSCRL training, greatly increasing data variability. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these contributions, showing that MLVGMs' generated views compete on par with or even surpass views generated from real data.
  This work establishes a principled approach to understanding and exploiting MLVGMs, advancing both generative modeling and self-supervised learning. Code and pre-trained models at: https://github.com/SerezD/mi_ml_gen.

Abstract: Domain shifts are critical issues that harm the performance of machine learning. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) mitigates this issue but suffers when the domain shifts are steep and drastic. Gradual Domain Adaptation (GDA) alleviates this problem in a mild way by gradually adapting from the source to the target domain using multiple intermediate domains. In this paper, we propose Sliding Window Adversarial Training (SWAT) for GDA. SWAT first formulates adversarial streams to connect the feature spaces of the source and target domains. Then, a sliding window paradigm is designed that moves along the adversarial stream to gradually narrow the small gap between adjacent intermediate domains. When the window moves to the end of the stream, i.e., the target domain, the domain shift is explicitly reduced. Extensive experiments on six GDA benchmarks demonstrate the significant effectiveness of SWAT, especially 6.1% improvement on Rotated MNIST and 4.1% advantage on CIFAR-100C over the previous methods.

Abstract: Radio map reconstruction is essential for enabling advanced applications, yet challenges such as complex signal propagation and sparse observational data hinder accurate reconstruction in practical scenarios. Existing methods often fail to align physical constraints with data-driven features, particularly under sparse measurement conditions. To address these issues, we propose **Phy**sics-Aligned **R**adio **M**ap **D**iffusion **M**odel (**PhyRMDM**), a novel framework that establishes cross-domain representation alignment between physical principles and neural network features through dual learning pathways. The proposed model integrates **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** with a **representation alignment mechanism** that explicitly enforces consistency between Helmholtz equation constraints and environmental propagation patterns. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving **NMSE of 0.0031** under *Static Radio Map (SRM)* conditions, and **NMSE of 0.0047** with **Dynamic Radio Map (DRM)** scenarios. The proposed representation alignment paradigm provides **37.2%** accuracy enhancement in ultra-sparse cases (**1%** sampling rate), confirming its effectiveness in bridging physics-based modeling and deep learning for radio map reconstruction.

Abstract: Chart generation aims to generate code to produce charts satisfying the desired visual properties, e.g., texts, layout, color, and type. It has great potential to empower the automatic professional report generation in financial analysis, research presentation, education, and healthcare. In this work, we build a vision-language model (VLM) based multi-agent framework for effective automatic chart generation. Generating high-quality charts requires both strong visual design skills and precise coding capabilities that embed the desired visual properties into code. Such a complex multi-modal reasoning process is difficult for direct prompting of VLMs. To resolve these challenges, we propose METAL, a multi-agent framework that decomposes the task of chart generation into the iterative collaboration among specialized agents. METAL achieves 5.2% improvement over the current best result in the chart generation task. The METAL framework exhibits the phenomenon of test-time scaling: its performance increases monotonically as the logarithmic computational budget grows from 512 to 8192 tokens. In addition, we find that separating different modalities during the critique process of METAL boosts the self-correction capability of VLMs in the multimodal context.

Abstract: Human drivers adeptly navigate complex scenarios by utilizing rich attentional semantics, but the current autonomous systems struggle to replicate this ability, as they often lose critical semantic information when converting 2D observations into 3D space. In this sense, it hinders their effective deployment in dynamic and complex environments. Leveraging the superior scene understanding and reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we propose VLM-E2E, a novel framework that uses the VLMs to enhance training by providing attentional cues. Our method integrates textual representations into Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features for semantic supervision, which enables the model to learn richer feature representations that explicitly capture the driver's attentional semantics. By focusing on attentional semantics, VLM-E2E better aligns with human-like driving behavior, which is critical for navigating dynamic and complex environments. Furthermore, we introduce a BEV-Text learnable weighted fusion strategy to address the issue of modality importance imbalance in fusing multimodal information. This approach dynamically balances the contributions of BEV and text features, ensuring that the complementary information from visual and textual modalities is effectively utilized. By explicitly addressing the imbalance in multimodal fusion, our method facilitates a more holistic and robust representation of driving environments. We evaluate VLM-E2E on the nuScenes dataset and achieve significant improvements in perception, prediction, and planning over the baseline end-to-end model, showcasing the effectiveness of our attention-enhanced BEV representation in enabling more accurate and reliable autonomous driving tasks.

Abstract: Image aesthetic assessment (IAA) evaluates image aesthetics, a task complicated by image diversity and user subjectivity. Current approaches address this in two stages: Generic IAA (GIAA) models estimate mean aesthetic scores, while Personal IAA (PIAA) models adapt GIAA using transfer learning to incorporate user subjectivity. However, a theoretical understanding of transfer learning between GIAA and PIAA, particularly concerning the impact of group composition, group size, aesthetic differences between groups and individuals, and demographic correlations, is lacking. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for IAA, proposing a unified model that encodes individual characteristics in a distributional format for both individual and group assessments. We show that transferring from GIAA to PIAA involves extrapolation, while the reverse involves interpolation, which is generally more effective for machine learning. Extensive experiments with varying group compositions, including sub-sampling by group size and disjoint demographics, reveal substantial performance variation even for GIAA, challenging the assumption that averaging scores eliminates individual subjectivity. Score-distribution analysis using Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and the Gini index identifies education, photography experience, and art experience as key factors in aesthetic differences, with greater subjectivity in artworks than in photographs.

Abstract: Badminton, known for having the fastest ball speeds among all sports, presents significant challenges to the field of computer vision, including player identification, court line detection, shuttlecock trajectory tracking, and player stroke-type classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel video clipping strategy to extract frames of each player's racket swing in a badminton broadcast match. These clipped frames are then processed by three existing models: one for Human Pose Estimation to obtain human skeletal joints, another for shuttlecock trajectory tracking, and the other for court line detection to determine player positions on the court. Leveraging these data as inputs, we propose Badminton Stroke-type Transformer (BST) to classify player stroke-types in singles. To the best of our knowledge, experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on the largest publicly available badminton video dataset (ShuttleSet), another badminton dataset (BadmintonDB), and a tennis dataset (TenniSet). These results suggest that effectively leveraging ball trajectory is a promising direction for action recognition in racket sports.

Abstract: Accurate staging of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is essential for guiding timely interventions and preventing vision loss. However, current staging models are hardly interpretable, and most public datasets contain no clinical reasoning or interpretation beyond image-level labels. In this paper, we present a novel method that integrates graph representation learning with vision-language models (VLMs) to deliver explainable DR diagnosis. Our approach leverages optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images by constructing biologically informed graphs that encode key retinal vascular features such as vessel morphology and spatial connectivity. A graph neural network (GNN) then performs DR staging while integrated gradients highlight critical nodes and edges and their individual features that drive the classification decisions. We collect this graph-based knowledge which attributes the model's prediction to physiological structures and their characteristics. We then transform it into textual descriptions for VLMs. We perform instruction-tuning with these textual descriptions and the corresponding image to train a student VLM. This final agent can classify the disease and explain its decision in a human interpretable way solely based on a single image input. Experimental evaluations on both proprietary and public datasets demonstrate that our method not only improves classification accuracy but also offers more clinically interpretable results. An expert study further demonstrates that our method provides more accurate diagnostic explanations and paves the way for precise localization of pathologies in OCTA images.

Abstract: Existing methods for egocentric action recognition often rely solely on RGB videos, while additional modalities, e.g., audio, can improve accuracy in challenging scenarios. However, most prior multimodal approaches assume all modalities are available at inference, leading to significant accuracy drops, or even failure, when inputs are missing. To address this, we introduce KARMMA, a multimodal Knowledge distillation approach for egocentric Action Recognition robust to Missing ModAlities that requires no modality alignment across all samples during training or inference. KARMMA distills knowledge from a multimodal teacher into a multimodal student that benefits from all available modalities while remaining robust to missing ones, making it suitable for diverse multimodal scenarios without retraining. Our student uses approximately 50% fewer computational resources than our teacher, resulting in a lightweight and fast model. Experiments on Epic-Kitchens and Something-Something show that our student achieves competitive accuracy while significantly reducing accuracy drops under missing modality conditions.

Abstract: The challenge of tracing the source attribution of forged faces has gained significant attention due to the rapid advancement of generative models. However, existing deepfake attribution (DFA) works primarily focus on the interaction among various domains in vision modality, and other modalities such as texts and face parsing are not fully explored. Besides, they tend to fail to assess the generalization performance of deepfake attributors to unseen advanced generators like diffusion in a fine-grained manner. In this paper, we propose a novel parsing-aware vision language model with dynamic contrastive learning(PVLM) method for zero-shot deepfake attribution (ZS-DFA),which facilitates effective and fine-grained traceability to unseen advanced generators. Specifically, we conduct a novel and fine-grained ZS-DFA benchmark to evaluate the attribution performance of deepfake attributors to unseen advanced generators like diffusion. Besides, we propose an innovative parsing-guided vision language model with dynamic contrastive learning (PVLM) method to capture general and diverse attribution features. We are motivated by the observation that the preservation of source face attributes in facial images generated by GAN and diffusion models varies significantly. We employ the inherent face attributes preservation differences to capture face parsing-aware forgery representations. Therefore, we devise a novel parsing encoder to focus on global face attribute embeddings, enabling parsing-guided DFA representation learning via dynamic vision-parsing matching. Additionally, we present a novel deepfake attribution contrastive center loss to pull relevant generators closer and push irrelevant ones away, which can be introduced into DFA models to enhance traceability. Experimental results show that our model exceeds the state-of-the-art on the ZS-DFA benchmark via various protocol evaluations.

<title>ReservoirTTA: Prolonged Test-time Adaptation for Evolving and Recurring Domains</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces ReservoirTTA, a novel plug-in framework designed for prolonged test-time adaptation (TTA) in scenarios where the test domain continuously shifts over time, including cases where domains recur or evolve gradually. At its core, ReservoirTTA maintains a reservoir of domain-specialized models -- an adaptive test-time model ensemble -- that both detects new domains via online clustering over style features of incoming samples and routes each sample to the appropriate specialized model, and thereby enables domain-specific adaptation. This multi-model strategy overcomes key limitations of single model adaptation, such as catastrophic forgetting, inter-domain interference, and error accumulation, ensuring robust and stable performance on sustained non-stationary test distributions. Our theoretical analysis reveals key components that bound parameter variance and prevent model collapse, while our plug-in TTA module mitigates catastrophic forgetting of previously encountered domains. Extensive experiments on scene-level corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C, CIFAR-10/100-C), object-level style shifts (DomainNet-126, PACS), and semantic segmentation (Cityscapes->ACDC) covering recurring and continuously evolving domain shifts -- show that ReservoirTTA substantially improves adaptation accuracy and maintains stable performance across prolonged, recurring shifts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/LTS5/ReservoirTTA.

Abstract: To what extent does concept erasure eliminate generative capacity in diffusion models? While prior evaluations have primarily focused on measuring concept suppression under specific textual prompts, we explore a complementary and fundamental question: do current concept erasure techniques genuinely remove the ability to generate targeted concepts, or do they merely achieve superficial, prompt-specific suppression? We systematically evaluate the robustness and reversibility of two representative concept erasure methods, Unified Concept Editing and Erased Stable Diffusion, by probing their ability to eliminate targeted generative behaviors in text-to-image models. These methods attempt to suppress undesired semantic concepts by modifying internal model parameters, either through targeted attention edits or model-level fine-tuning strategies. To rigorously assess whether these techniques truly erase generative capacity, we propose an instance-level evaluation strategy that employs lightweight fine-tuning to explicitly test the reactivation potential of erased concepts. Through quantitative metrics and qualitative analyses, we show that erased concepts often reemerge with substantial visual fidelity after minimal adaptation, indicating that current methods suppress latent generative representations without fully eliminating them. Our findings reveal critical limitations in existing concept erasure approaches and highlight the need for deeper, representation-level interventions and more rigorous evaluation standards to ensure genuine, irreversible removal of concepts from generative models.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on synthetic data often perform poorly on real-world images due to domain gaps, particularly in adverse conditions where labeled data is scarce. Yet, recent foundation models enable to generate realistic images without any training. This paper proposes to leverage such diffusion models to improve the performance of vision models when learned on synthetic data. We introduce two novel techniques for semantically consistent style transfer using diffusion models: Class-wise Adaptive Instance Normalization and Cross-Attention (CACTI) and its extension with selective attention Filtering (CACTIF). CACTI applies statistical normalization selectively based on semantic classes, while CACTIF further filters cross-attention maps based on feature similarity, preventing artifacts in regions with weak cross-attention correspondences. Our methods transfer style characteristics while preserving semantic boundaries and structural coherence, unlike approaches that apply global transformations or generate content without constraints. Experiments using GTA5 as source and Cityscapes/ACDC as target domains show that our approach produces higher quality images with lower FID scores and better content preservation. Our work demonstrates that class-aware diffusion-based style transfer effectively bridges the synthetic-to-real domain gap even with minimal target domain data, advancing robust perception systems for challenging real-world applications.

Abstract: Lip synchronization is the task of aligning a speaker's lip movements in video with corresponding speech audio, and it is essential for creating realistic, expressive video content. However, existing methods often rely on reference frames and masked-frame inpainting, which limit their robustness to identity consistency, pose variations, facial occlusions, and stylized content. In addition, since audio signals provide weaker conditioning than visual cues, lip shape leakage from the original video will affect lip sync quality. In this paper, we present OmniSync, a universal lip synchronization framework for diverse visual scenarios. Our approach introduces a mask-free training paradigm using Diffusion Transformer models for direct frame editing without explicit masks, enabling unlimited-duration inference while maintaining natural facial dynamics and preserving character identity. During inference, we propose a flow-matching-based progressive noise initialization to ensure pose and identity consistency, while allowing precise mouth-region editing. To address the weak conditioning signal of audio, we develop a Dynamic Spatiotemporal Classifier-Free Guidance (DS-CFG) mechanism that adaptively adjusts guidance strength over time and space. We also establish the AIGC-LipSync Benchmark, the first evaluation suite for lip synchronization in diverse AI-generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniSync significantly outperforms prior methods in both visual quality and lip sync accuracy, achieving superior results in both real-world and AI-generated videos.

Abstract: The desire for cameras with smaller form factors has recently lead to a push for exploring computational imaging systems with reduced optical complexity such as a smaller number of lens elements. Unfortunately such simplified optical systems usually suffer from severe aberrations, especially in off-axis regions, which can be difficult to correct purely in software. In this paper we introduce Fovea Stacking , a new type of imaging system that utilizes emerging dynamic optical components called deformable phase plates (DPPs) for localized aberration correction anywhere on the image sensor. By optimizing DPP deformations through a differentiable optical model, off-axis aberrations are corrected locally, producing a foveated image with enhanced sharpness at the fixation point - analogous to the eye's fovea. Stacking multiple such foveated images, each with a different fixation point, yields a composite image free from aberrations. To efficiently cover the entire field of view, we propose joint optimization of DPP deformations under imaging budget constraints. Due to the DPP device's non-linear behavior, we introduce a neural network-based control model for improved alignment between simulation-hardware performance. We further demonstrated that for extended depth-of-field imaging, fovea stacking outperforms traditional focus stacking in image quality. By integrating object detection or eye-tracking, the system can dynamically adjust the lens to track the object of interest-enabling real-time foveated video suitable for downstream applications such as surveillance or foveated virtual reality displays

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) clustering assigns similar pixels to the same class without any annotations, which is an important yet challenging task. For large-scale HSIs, most methods rely on superpixel segmentation and perform superpixel-level clustering based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, existing GNNs cannot fully exploit the spectral information of the input HSI, and the inaccurate superpixel topological graph may lead to the confusion of different class semantics during information aggregation. To address these challenges, we first propose a structural-spectral graph convolutional operator (SSGCO) tailored for graph-structured HSI superpixels to improve their representation quality through the co-extraction of spatial and spectral features. Second, we propose an evidence-guided adaptive edge learning (EGAEL) module that adaptively predicts and refines edge weights in the superpixel topological graph. We integrate the proposed method into a contrastive learning framework to achieve clustering, where representation learning and clustering are simultaneously conducted. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves clustering accuracy by 2.61%, 6.06%, 4.96% and 3.15% over the best compared methods on four HSI datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/jhqi/SSGCO-EGAEL.

Abstract: Driving scenes are inherently heterogeneous and dynamic. Multi-attribute scene identification, as a high-level visual perception capability, provides autonomous vehicles (AVs) with essential contextual awareness to understand, reason through, and interact with complex driving environments. Although scene identification is best modeled as a multi-label classification problem via multitask learning, it faces two major challenges: the difficulty of acquiring balanced, comprehensively annotated datasets and the need to re-annotate all training data when new attributes emerge. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel deep learning method that integrates Knowledge Acquisition and Accumulation (KAA) with Consistency-based Active Learning (CAL). KAA leverages monotask learning on heterogeneous single-label datasets to build a knowledge foundation, while CAL bridges the gap between single- and multi-label data, adapting the foundation model for multi-label scene classification. An ablation study on the newly developed Driving Scene Identification (DSI) dataset demonstrates a 56.1% improvement over an ImageNet-pretrained baseline. Moreover, KAA-CAL outperforms state-of-the-art multi-label classification methods on the BDD100K and HSD datasets, achieving this with 85% less data and even recognizing attributes unseen during foundation model training. The DSI dataset and KAA-CAL implementation code are publicly available at https://github.com/KELISBU/KAA-CAL .

Abstract: One of the key impediments for developing and assessing robust medical imaging algorithms is limited access to large-scale datasets with suitable annotations. Synthetic data generated with plausible physical and biological constraints may address some of these data limitations. We propose the use of physics simulations to generate synthetic images with pixel-level segmentation annotations, which are notoriously difficult to obtain. Specifically, we apply this approach to breast imaging analysis and release T-SYNTH, a large-scale open-source dataset of paired 2D digital mammography (DM) and 3D digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images. Our initial experimental results indicate that T-SYNTH images show promise for augmenting limited real patient datasets for detection tasks in DM and DBT.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide interpretable decision-making through explicit, human-understandable concepts. However, existing generative CBMs often rely on auxiliary visual cues at the bottleneck, which undermines interpretability and intervention capabilities. We propose EnCoBo, a post-hoc concept bottleneck for generative models that eliminates auxiliary cues by constraining all representations to flow solely through explicit concepts. Unlike autoencoder-based approaches that inherently rely on black-box decoders, EnCoBo leverages a decoder-free, energy-based framework that directly guides generation in the latent space. Guided by diffusion-scheduled energy functions, EnCoBo supports robust post-hoc interventions-such as concept composition and negation-across arbitrary concepts. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and CUB datasets showed that EnCoBo improved concept-level human intervention and interpretability while maintaining competitive visual quality.

Abstract: Earlier Sign Language Production (SLP) models typically relied on autoregressive methods that generate output tokens one by one, which inherently provide temporal alignment. Although techniques like Teacher Forcing can prevent model collapse during training, they still cannot solve the problem of error accumulation during inference, since ground truth is unavailable at that stage. In contrast, more recent approaches based on diffusion models leverage step-by-step denoising to enable high-quality generation. However, the iterative nature of these models and the requirement to denoise entire sequences limit their applicability in real-time tasks like SLP. To address it, we explore a hybrid approach that combines autoregressive and diffusion models for SLP, leveraging the strengths of both models in sequential dependency modeling and output refinement. To capture fine-grained body movements, we design a Multi-Scale Pose Representation module that separately extracts detailed features from distinct articulators and integrates them via a Multi-Scale Fusion module. Furthermore, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Causal Attention mechanism that utilizes joint-level confidence scores to dynamically guide the pose generation process, improving accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the PHOENIX14T and How2Sign datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both generation quality and real-time efficiency.

Abstract: Transformer-based models exhibit strong global modeling capabilities in single-image dehazing, but their high computational cost limits real-time applicability. Existing methods predominantly rely on spatial-domain features to capture long-range dependencies, which are computationally expensive and often inadequate under complex haze conditions. While some approaches introduce frequency-domain cues, the weak coupling between spatial and frequency branches limits the overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Dark Channel Guided Frequency-aware Dehazing Network (DGFDNet), a novel dual-domain framework that performs physically guided degradation alignment across spatial and frequency domains. At its core, the DGFDBlock comprises two key modules: 1) the Haze-Aware Frequency Modulator (HAFM), which generates a pixel-level haze confidence map from dark channel priors to adaptively enhance haze-relevant frequency components, thereby achieving global degradation-aware spectral modulation; 2) the Multi-level Gating Aggregation Module (MGAM), which fuses multi-scale features through diverse convolutional kernels and hybrid gating mechanisms to recover fine structural details. Additionally, a Prior Correction Guidance Branch (PCGB) incorporates a closed-loop feedback mechanism, enabling iterative refinement of the prior by intermediate dehazed features and significantly improving haze localization accuracy, especially in challenging outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark haze datasets demonstrate that DGFDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior robustness and real-time efficiency. Code is available at: https://github.com/Dilizlr/DGFDNet.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) reasoning tasks require agents to interpret multimodal instructions, perform long-horizon planning, and act adaptively in dynamic environments. Existing approaches typically train VLA models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping inputs to actions without explicit reasoning, which hinders their ability to plan over multiple steps or adapt to complex task variations. In this paper, we propose ThinkAct, a dual-system framework that bridges high-level reasoning with low-level action execution via reinforced visual latent planning. ThinkAct trains a multimodal LLM to generate embodied reasoning plans guided by reinforcing action-aligned visual rewards based on goal completion and trajectory consistency. These reasoning plans are compressed into a visual plan latent that conditions a downstream action model for robust action execution on target environments. Extensive experiments on embodied reasoning and robot manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkAct enables few-shot adaptation, long-horizon planning, and self-correction behaviors in complex embodied AI tasks.

Abstract: Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical challenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in Whole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus calling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world adoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per institution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on scanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis and treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on standard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during training, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same tissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset explicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability. SCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding 2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the isolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of model consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition. Furthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines augmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to explicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons improves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising task-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing SimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for evaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a new standard for reliability testing.

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D gaze redirection framework that leverages an explicit 3D eyeball structure. Existing gaze redirection methods are typically based on neural radiance fields, which employ implicit neural representations via volume rendering. Unlike these NeRF-based approaches, where the rotation and translation of 3D representations are not explicitly modeled, we introduce a dedicated 3D eyeball structure to represent the eyeballs with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method generates photorealistic images that faithfully reproduce the desired gaze direction by explicitly rotating and translating the 3D eyeball structure. In addition, we propose an adaptive deformation module that enables the replication of subtle muscle movements around the eyes. Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of generating diverse novel gaze images, achieving superior image quality and gaze estimation accuracy compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful, improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the visual domain.

<title>Dual-Mode Deep Anomaly Detection for Medical Manufacturing: Structural Similarity and Feature Distance</title>

Abstract: Automated visual inspection in medical device manufacturing faces unique challenges, including small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and strict regulatory requirements. To address these, we propose two attention-guided autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection. The first employs a structural similarity-based scoring approach that enables lightweight, real-time defect detection with unsupervised thresholding and can be further enhanced through limited supervised tuning. The second applies a feature distance-based strategy using Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, designed to monitor distributional shifts and support supervisory oversight. Evaluations on a representative sterile packaging dataset confirm that both approaches outperform baselines under hardware-constrained, regulated conditions. Cross-domain testing on the MVTec-Zipper benchmark further demonstrates that the structural similarity-based method generalises effectively and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods, while the feature distance-based method is less transferable but provides complementary monitoring capabilities. These results highlight a dual-pathway inspection strategy: structural similarity for robust inline detection and feature distance for supervisory monitoring. By combining operational performance with interpretability and lifecycle monitoring, the proposed methods also align with emerging regulatory expectations for high-risk AI systems.

<title>TIDE: Achieving Balanced Subject-Driven Image Generation via Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancement</title>

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework, which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image, instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance, outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation, and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at https://github.com/KomJay520/TIDE.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making reflects diverse strategies shaped by regional patient populations and institutional protocols. However, most existing medical artificial intelligence (AI) models are trained on highly prevalent data patterns, which reinforces biases and fails to capture the breadth of clinical expertise. Inspired by the recent advances in Mixture of Experts (MoE), we propose a Mixture of Multicenter Experts (MoME) framework to address AI bias in the medical domain without requiring data sharing across institutions. MoME integrates specialized expertise from diverse clinical strategies to enhance model generalizability and adaptability across medical centers. We validate this framework using a multimodal target volume delineation model for prostate cancer radiotherapy. With few-shot training that combines imaging and clinical notes from each center, the model outperformed baselines, particularly in settings with high inter-center variability or limited data availability. Furthermore, MoME enables model customization to local clinical preferences without cross-institutional data exchange, making it especially suitable for resource-constrained settings while promoting broadly generalizable medical AI.

Abstract: Research in medical imaging primarily focuses on discrete data representations that poorly scale with grid resolution and fail to capture the often continuous nature of the underlying signal. Neural Fields (NFs) offer a powerful alternative by modeling data as continuous functions. While single-instance NFs have successfully been applied in medical contexts, extending them to large-scale medical datasets remains an open challenge. We therefore introduce MedFuncta, a unified framework for large-scale NF training on diverse medical signals. Building on Functa, our approach encodes data into a unified representation, namely a 1D latent vector, that modulates a shared, meta-learned NF, enabling generalization across a dataset. We revisit common design choices, introducing a non-constant frequency parameter $\omega$ in widely used SIREN activations, and establish a connection between this $\omega$-schedule and layer-wise learning rates, relating our findings to recent work in theoretical learning dynamics. We additionally introduce a scalable meta-learning strategy for shared network learning that employs sparse supervision during training, thereby reducing memory consumption and computational overhead while maintaining competitive performance. Finally, we evaluate MedFuncta across a diverse range of medical datasets and show how to solve relevant downstream tasks on our neural data representation. To promote further research in this direction, we release our code, model weights and the first large-scale dataset - MedNF - containing > 500 k latent vectors for multi-instance medical NFs.

Abstract: Generating high-quality full-body dance sequences from music is a challenging task as it requires strict adherence to genre-specific choreography. Moreover, the generated sequences must be both physically realistic and precisely synchronized with the beats and rhythm of the music. To overcome these challenges, we propose GCDance, a classifier-free diffusion framework for generating genre-specific dance motions conditioned on both music and textual prompts. Specifically, our approach extracts music features by combining high-level pre-trained music foundation model features with hand-crafted features for multi-granularity feature fusion. To achieve genre controllability, we leverage CLIP to efficiently embed genre-based textual prompt representations at each time step within our dance generation pipeline. Our GCDance framework can generate diverse dance styles from the same piece of music while ensuring coherence with the rhythm and melody of the music. Extensive experimental results obtained on the FineDance dataset demonstrate that GCDance significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches, which also achieve competitive results on the AIST++ dataset. Our ablation and inference time analysis demonstrate that GCDance provides an effective solution for high-quality music-driven dance generation.

Abstract: A common belief is that intrinsically interpretable deep learning models ensure a correct, intuitive understanding of their behavior and offer greater robustness against accidental errors or intentional manipulation. However, these beliefs have not been comprehensively verified, and growing evidence casts doubt on them. In this paper, we highlight the risks related to overreliance and susceptibility to adversarial manipulation of these so-called "intrinsically (aka inherently) interpretable" models by design. We introduce two strategies for adversarial analysis with prototype manipulation and backdoor attacks against prototype-based networks, and discuss how concept bottleneck models defend against these attacks. Fooling the model's reasoning by exploiting its use of latent prototypes manifests the inherent uninterpretability of deep neural networks, leading to a false sense of security reinforced by a visual confirmation bias. The reported limitations of part-prototype networks put their trustworthiness and applicability into question, motivating further work on the robustness and alignment of (deep) interpretable models.

Abstract: In practical applications, low-light images are often compressed for efficient storage and transmission. Most existing methods disregard compression artifacts removal or hardly establish a unified framework for joint task enhancement of low-light images with varying compression qualities. To address this problem, we propose a hybrid priors-guided network (HPGN) that enhances compressed low-light images by integrating both compression and illumination priors. Our approach fully utilizes the JPEG quality factor (QF) and DCT quantization matrix to guide the design of efficient plug-and-play modules for joint tasks. Additionally, we employ a random QF generation strategy to guide model training, enabling a single model to enhance low-light images with different compression levels. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method..

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting anomalies as samples that do not conform to structured patterns represented by low-dimensional manifolds. To this end, we conceive a general anomaly detection framework called Preference Isolation Forest (PIF), that combines the benefits of adaptive isolation-based methods with the flexibility of preference embedding. The key intuition is to embed the data into a high-dimensional preference space by fitting low-dimensional manifolds, and to identify anomalies as isolated points. We propose three isolation approaches to identify anomalies: $i$) Voronoi-iForest, the most general solution, $ii$) RuzHash-iForest, that avoids explicit computation of distances via Local Sensitive Hashing, and $iii$) Sliding-PIF, that leverages a locality prior to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

<title>GAF: Gaussian Action Field as a Dynamic World Model for Robotic Manipulation</title>

Abstract: Accurate scene perception is critical for vision-based robotic manipulation. Existing approaches typically follow either a Vision-to-Action (V-A) paradigm, predicting actions directly from visual inputs, or a Vision-to-3D-to-Action (V-3D-A) paradigm, leveraging intermediate 3D representations. However, these methods often struggle with action inaccuracies due to the complexity and dynamic nature of manipulation scenes. In this paper, we adopt a V-4D-A framework that enables direct action reasoning from motion-aware 4D representations via a Gaussian Action Field (GAF). GAF extends 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) by incorporating learnable motion attributes, allowing 4D modeling of dynamic scenes and manipulation actions. To learn time-varying scene geometry and action-aware robot motion, GAF provides three interrelated outputs: reconstruction of the current scene, prediction of future frames, and estimation of init action via Gaussian motion. Furthermore, we employ an action-vision-aligned denoising framework, conditioned on a unified representation that combines the init action and the Gaussian perception, both generated by the GAF, to further obtain more precise actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements, with GAF achieving +11.5385 dB PSNR, +0.3864 SSIM and -0.5574 LPIPS improvements in reconstruction quality, while boosting the average +7.3% success rate in robotic manipulation tasks over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Many methods exist for frame synthesis in image sequences but can be broadly categorised into frame interpolation and view synthesis techniques. Fundamentally, both frame interpolation and view synthesis tackle the same task, interpolating a frame given surrounding frames in time or space. However, most frame interpolation datasets focus on temporal aspects with single cameras moving through time and space, while view synthesis datasets are typically biased toward stereoscopic depth estimation use cases. This makes direct comparison between view synthesis and frame interpolation methods challenging. In this paper, we develop a novel multi-camera dataset using a custom-built dense linear camera array to enable fair comparison between these approaches. We evaluate classical and deep learning frame interpolators against a view synthesis method (3D Gaussian Splatting) for the task of view in-betweening. Our results reveal that deep learning methods do not significantly outperform classical methods on real image data, with 3D Gaussian Splatting actually underperforming frame interpolators by as much as 3.5 dB PSNR. However, in synthetic scenes, the situation reverses -- 3D Gaussian Splatting outperforms frame interpolation algorithms by almost 5 dB PSNR at a 95% confidence level.

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI) offers a way to generate intermediate frames between consecutive frames of a video sequence. Although the development of advanced frame interpolation algorithms has received increased attention in recent years, assessing the perceptual quality of interpolated content remains an ongoing area of research. In this paper, we investigate simple ways to process motion fields, with the purposes of using them as video quality metric for evaluating frame interpolation algorithms. We evaluate these quality metrics using the BVI-VFI dataset which contains perceptual scores measured for interpolated sequences. From our investigation we propose a motion metric based on measuring the divergence of motion fields. This metric correlates reasonably with these perceptual scores (PLCC=0.51) and is more computationally efficient (x2.7 speedup) compared to FloLPIPS (a well known motion-based metric). We then use our new proposed metrics to evaluate a range of state of the art frame interpolation metrics and find our metrics tend to favour more perceptual pleasing interpolated frames that may not score highly in terms of PSNR or SSIM.

Abstract: This paper introduces MovieCORE, a novel video question answering (VQA) dataset designed to probe deeper cognitive understanding of movie content. Unlike existing datasets that focus on surface-level comprehension, MovieCORE emphasizes questions that engage System-2 thinking while remaining specific to the video material. We present an innovative agentic brainstorming approach, utilizing multiple large language models (LLMs) as thought agents to generate and refine high-quality question-answer pairs. To evaluate dataset quality, we develop a set of cognitive tests assessing depth, thought-provocation potential, and syntactic complexity. We also propose a comprehensive evaluation scheme for assessing VQA model performance on deeper cognitive tasks. To address the limitations of existing video-language models (VLMs), we introduce an agentic enhancement module, Agentic Choice Enhancement (ACE), which improves model reasoning capabilities post-training by up to 25%. Our work contributes to advancing movie understanding in AI systems and provides valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of current VQA models when faced with more challenging, nuanced questions about cinematic content.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) represent abnormal cell division associated with poor prognosis. Yet their detection remains difficult due to low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG 2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple domains. In this work, we fine-tuned the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision transformer, pretrained on natural images, using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), training only ~1.3M parameters in combination with extensive augmentation and a domain-weighted Focal Loss to handle domain heterogeneity. Despite the domain gap, our fine-tuned DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology, reaching second place on the preliminary test set. These results highlight the advantages of DINOv3 pretraining and underline the efficiency and robustness of our fine-tuning strategy, yielding state-of-the-art results for the atypical mitosis classification challenge in MIDOG 2025.

Abstract: Mitotic figures are classified into typical and atypical variants, with atypical counts correlating strongly with tumor aggressiveness. Accurate differentiation is therefore essential for patient prognostication and resource allocation, yet remains challenging even for expert pathologists. Here, we leveraged Pathology Foundation Models (PFMs) pre-trained on large histopathology datasets and applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning via low-rank adaptation. In addition, we incorporated ConvNeXt V2, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network architecture, to complement PFMs. During training, we employed a fisheye transform to emphasize mitoses and Fourier Domain Adaptation using ImageNet target images. Finally, we ensembled multiple PFMs to integrate complementary morphological insights, achieving competitive balanced accuracy on the Preliminary Evaluation Phase dataset.

Abstract: The growing popularity of robotic minimally invasive surgeries has made deep learning-based surgical training a key area of research. A thorough understanding of the surgical scene components is crucial, which semantic segmentation models can help achieve. However, most existing work focuses on surgical tools and overlooks anatomical objects. Additionally, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models struggle to balance capturing high-level contextual features and low-level edge features. We propose a Feature-Adaptive Spatial Localization model (FASL-Seg), designed to capture features at multiple levels of detail through two distinct processing streams, namely a Low-Level Feature Projection (LLFP) and a High-Level Feature Projection (HLFP) stream, for varying feature resolutions - enabling precise segmentation of anatomy and surgical instruments. We evaluated FASL-Seg on surgical segmentation benchmark datasets EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 on three use cases. The FASL-Seg model achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 72.71% on parts and anatomy segmentation in EndoVis18, improving on SOTA by 5%. It further achieves a mIoU of 85.61% and 72.78% in EndoVis18 and EndoVis17 tool type segmentation, respectively, outperforming SOTA overall performance, with comparable per-class SOTA results in both datasets and consistent performance in various classes for anatomy and instruments, demonstrating the effectiveness of distinct processing streams for varying feature resolutions.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Summary:
This work introduces an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making, utilizing proximal exemplars in an embedding space to create a per-instance thresholding criterion. By fusing predictive distributions through Dempster-Shafer theory, a transparent and auditable decision-making process is achieved. Experimentation on CIFAR-10/100 datasets with BiT and ViT backbones demonstrates improved uncertainty-aware performance with fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and manageable review loads compared to traditional entropy-based thresholds. Interestingly, the study finds that only a small set of evidences is necessary to realize these benefits, with minimal improvements gained from increasing the evidence set. The evidence-conditioned tagging approach emerges as a reliable and interpretable alternative to fixed prediction entropy thresholds for operational uncertainty-aware decision-making.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This work proposes an evidence-retrieval mechanism for uncertainty-aware decision-making that replaces a single global cutoff with an evidence-conditioned, instance-adaptive criterion. For each test instance, proximal exemplars are retrieved in an embedding space; their predictive distributions are fused via Dempster-Shafer theory. The resulting fused belief acts as a per-instance thresholding mechanism. Because the supporting evidences are explicit, decisions are transparent and auditable. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 with BiT and ViT backbones show higher or comparable uncertainty-aware performance with materially fewer confidently incorrect outcomes and a sustainable review load compared with applying threshold on prediction entropy. Notably, only a few evidences are sufficient to realize these gains; increasing the evidence set yields only modest changes. These results indicate that evidence-conditioned tagging provides a more reliable and interpretable alternative to fixed prediction entropy thresholds for operational uncertainty-aware decision-making.

Abstract: This study presents a systematic comparison between hybrid quantum-classical neural networks and purely classical models across three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR100, and STL10) to evaluate their performance, efficiency, and robustness. The hybrid models integrate parameterized quantum circuits with classical deep learning architectures, while the classical counterparts use conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Experiments were conducted over 50 training epochs for each dataset, with evaluations on validation accuracy, test accuracy, training time, computational resource usage, and adversarial robustness (tested with $\epsilon=0.1$ perturbations).Key findings demonstrate that hybrid models consistently outperform classical models in final accuracy, achieving {99.38\% (MNIST), 41.69\% (CIFAR100), and 74.05\% (STL10) validation accuracy, compared to classical benchmarks of 98.21\%, 32.25\%, and 63.76\%, respectively. Notably, the hybrid advantage scales with dataset complexity, showing the most significant gains on CIFAR100 (+9.44\%) and STL10 (+10.29\%). Hybrid models also train 5--12$\times$ faster (e.g., 21.23s vs. 108.44s per epoch on MNIST) and use 6--32\% fewer parameters} while maintaining superior generalization to unseen test data.Adversarial robustness tests reveal that hybrid models are significantly more resilient on simpler datasets (e.g., 45.27\% robust accuracy on MNIST vs. 10.80\% for classical) but show comparable fragility on complex datasets like CIFAR100 ($\sim$1\% robustness for both). Resource efficiency analyses indicate that hybrid models consume less memory (4--5GB vs. 5--6GB for classical) and lower CPU utilization (9.5\% vs. 23.2\% on average).These results suggest that hybrid quantum-classical architectures offer compelling advantages in accuracy, training efficiency, and parameter scalability, particularly for complex vision tasks.

Summary: 
This study introduces an integrated technical framework to improve traffic flow perception and congestion forecasting on expressways. By optimizing baseline algorithms such as YOLOv11-DIoU and DeepSort, the study achieved higher accuracy in vehicle perception and tracking under occlusion. The Greenberg model was used to analyze traffic flow, showing a strong negative correlation between speed and density. A GRU-Attention model was developed for congestion warning, achieving high test accuracy and precise time error predictions. In validation tests, the framework demonstrated significant improvements in warning accuracy and spatial overlap of congestion points, even in high-flow scenarios. Overall, this framework provides valuable support for expressway congestion control and shows great potential for intelligent transportation applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Expressway traffic congestion severely reduces travel efficiency and hinders regional connectivity. Existing "detection-prediction" systems have critical flaws: low vehicle perception accuracy under occlusion and loss of long-sequence dependencies in congestion forecasting. This study proposes an integrated technical framework to resolve these issues.For traffic flow perception, two baseline algorithms were optimized. Traditional YOLOv11 was upgraded to YOLOv11-DIoU by replacing GIoU Loss with DIoU Loss, and DeepSort was improved by fusing Mahalanobis (motion) and cosine (appearance) distances. Experiments on Chang-Shen Expressway videos showed YOLOv11-DIoU achieved 95.7\% mAP (6.5 percentage points higher than baseline) with 5.3\% occlusion miss rate. DeepSort reached 93.8\% MOTA (11.3 percentage points higher than SORT) with only 4 ID switches. Using the Greenberg model (for 10-15 vehicles/km high-density scenarios), speed and density showed a strong negative correlation (r=-0.97), conforming to traffic flow theory. For congestion warning, a GRU-Attention model was built to capture congestion precursors. Trained 300 epochs with flow, density, and speed, it achieved 99.7\% test accuracy (7-9 percentage points higher than traditional GRU). In 10-minute advance warnings for 30-minute congestion, time error was $\leq$ 1 minute. Validation with an independent video showed 95\% warning accuracy, over 90\% spatial overlap of congestion points, and stable performance in high-flow ($>$5 vehicles/second) scenarios.This framework provides quantitative support for expressway congestion control, with promising intelligent transportation applications.

Summary: 
This paper presents a systematic empirical analysis of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. The study investigates the mechanisms, advantages, and sensitivity of VLM-based OOD detection. Mechanisms are characterized and formalized, highlighting key operational properties in the VLM embedding space that enable effective zero-shot OOD detection. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of VLMs over single-modal approaches, attributed to their ability to leverage rich semantic novelty. However, the study reveals a sensitivity in VLM-based methods to prompt phrasing, despite their resilience to common image noise. This asymmetry in robustness profile indicates a critical vulnerability in VLM-based OOD detection. The findings contribute to a more structured understanding of VLM strengths and vulnerabilities, providing essential guidance for enhancing the robustness and reliability of future designs.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot out-of-distribution (OOD) detection capabilities, vital for reliable AI systems. Despite this promising capability, a comprehensive understanding of (1) why they work so effectively, (2) what advantages do they have over single-modal methods, and (3) how is their behavioral robustness -- remains notably incomplete within the research community. This paper presents a systematic empirical analysis of VLM-based OOD detection using in-distribution (ID) and OOD prompts. (1) Mechanisms: We systematically characterize and formalize key operational properties within the VLM embedding space that facilitate zero-shot OOD detection. (2) Advantages: We empirically quantify the superiority of these models over established single-modal approaches, attributing this distinct advantage to the VLM's capacity to leverage rich semantic novelty. (3) Sensitivity: We uncovers a significant and previously under-explored asymmetry in their robustness profile: while exhibiting resilience to common image noise, these VLM-based methods are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing. Our findings contribute a more structured understanding of the strengths and critical vulnerabilities inherent in VLM-based OOD detection, offering crucial, empirically-grounded guidance for developing more robust and reliable future designs.

<div> Keywords: Instruction-based image editing, Evaluation framework, Object-centric perspective, Multi-turn editing benchmark, State-of-the-art editing models

Summary: 
The article introduces EdiVal-Agent, an evaluation framework for instruction-based image editing that focuses on an object-centric perspective. It decomposes images into semantically meaningful objects and synthesizes diverse editing instructions. The framework combines vision-language models with object detectors for instruction-following evaluation and uses semantic-level feature extractors for content consistency assessment. Human preference models are leveraged for judging visual quality. EdiVal-Agent shows improved agreement with human judgments compared to existing methods and allows for seamless integration of future tools. The framework is instantiated in EdiVal-Bench, a benchmark covering multiple editing models and instruction types. It aids in identifying failure modes of current editing models and informing the development of next-generation models. The project page for EdiVal-Agent can be found at https://tianyucodings.github.io/EdiVAL-page/. 

<br /><br />Summary:  <div>
arXiv:2509.13399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has advanced rapidly, yet reliable and interpretable evaluation remains a bottleneck. Current protocols either (i) depend on paired reference images -- resulting in limited coverage and inheriting biases from prior generative models -- or (ii) rely solely on zero-shot vision-language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of instruction following, content consistency, and visual quality are often imprecise.
  To address this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated, scalable, and fine-grained evaluation framework for multi-turn instruction-based editing from an object-centric perspective, supported by a suite of expert tools. Given an image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it into semantically meaningful objects, then synthesizes diverse, context-aware editing instructions. For evaluation, it integrates VLMs with open-vocabulary object detectors to assess instruction following, uses semantic-level feature extractors to evaluate content consistency, and leverages human preference models to judge visual quality. We show that combining VLMs with object detectors yields stronger agreement with human judgments in instruction-following evaluation compared to using VLMs alone and CLIP-based metrics. Furthermore, the pipeline's modular design allows future tools to be seamlessly integrated, enhancing evaluation accuracy over time.
  Instantiating this pipeline, we build EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing benchmark covering 9 instruction types and 11 state-of-the-art editing models spanning autoregressive (AR) (including Nano Banana, GPT-Image-1), flow-matching, and diffusion paradigms. We demonstrate that EdiVal-Agent can be used to identify existing failure modes, thereby informing the development of the next generation of editing models.

Summary: <br />
MapAnything is a transformer-based feed-forward model that can process one or more images and additional geometric inputs to directly estimate metric 3D scene geometry and cameras. It utilizes a factored representation of multi-view scene geometry, including depth maps, local ray maps, camera poses, and a metric scale factor to ensure global consistency. By standardizing supervision and training protocols across datasets and allowing for flexible input augmentation, MapAnything can perform various 3D vision tasks in a single pass. These tasks include uncalibrated structure-from-motion, multi-view stereo, monocular depth estimation, camera localization, and depth completion. Experimental results show that MapAnything outperforms or matches specialized models while offering more efficient joint training behavior. This model could potentially serve as a universal backbone for 3D reconstruction tasks. <div>

Abstract: We introduce MapAnything, a unified transformer-based feed-forward model that ingests one or more images along with optional geometric inputs such as camera intrinsics, poses, depth, or partial reconstructions, and then directly regresses the metric 3D scene geometry and cameras. MapAnything leverages a factored representation of multi-view scene geometry, i.e., a collection of depth maps, local ray maps, camera poses, and a metric scale factor that effectively upgrades local reconstructions into a globally consistent metric frame. Standardizing the supervision and training across diverse datasets, along with flexible input augmentation, enables MapAnything to address a broad range of 3D vision tasks in a single feed-forward pass, including uncalibrated structure-from-motion, calibrated multi-view stereo, monocular depth estimation, camera localization, depth completion, and more. We provide extensive experimental analyses and model ablations demonstrating that MapAnything outperforms or matches specialist feed-forward models while offering more efficient joint training behavior, thus paving the way toward a universal 3D reconstruction backbone.

Summary:<br /><br />Ensuring accurate localization of robots in GPS-denied environments is challenging. Current RGB-based Visual Place Recognition (VPR) methods are sensitive to environmental changes. This study introduces a Semantic-Enhanced Cross-Modal Place Recognition (SCM-PR) framework for robust localization in LiDAR maps. The proposed framework includes a VMamba backbone for feature extraction, Semantic-Aware Feature Fusion (SAFF) module, LiDAR descriptors with semantic information, and a cross-modal semantic attention mechanism in NetVLAD. Additionally, a Multi-View Semantic-Geometric Matching and Semantic Consistency Loss were implemented in a contrastive learning framework. Experimental results on KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate that SCM-PR outperforms existing cross-modal place recognition methods, showcasing state-of-the-art performance. <div>

Abstract: Ensuring accurate localization of robots in environments without GPS capability is a challenging task. Visual Place Recognition (VPR) techniques can potentially achieve this goal, but existing RGB-based methods are sensitive to changes in illumination, weather, and other seasonal changes. Existing cross-modal localization methods leverage the geometric properties of RGB images and 3D LiDAR maps to reduce the sensitivity issues highlighted above. Currently, state-of-the-art methods struggle in complex scenes, fine-grained or high-resolution matching, and situations where changes can occur in viewpoint. In this work, we introduce a framework we call Semantic-Enhanced Cross-Modal Place Recognition (SCM-PR) that combines high-level semantics utilizing RGB images for robust localization in LiDAR maps. Our proposed method introduces: a VMamba backbone for feature extraction of RGB images; a Semantic-Aware Feature Fusion (SAFF) module for using both place descriptors and segmentation masks; LiDAR descriptors that incorporate both semantics and geometry; and a cross-modal semantic attention mechanism in NetVLAD to improve matching. Incorporating the semantic information also was instrumental in designing a Multi-View Semantic-Geometric Matching and a Semantic Consistency Loss, both in a contrastive learning framework. Our experimental work on the KITTI and KITTI-360 datasets show that SCM-PR achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other cross-modal place recognition methods.

<div> Keywords: 3D Gaussian Splatting, data compression, neural networks, lattice vector quantization, scene-adaptive optimization

Summary:<br />
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a popular rendering method with high quality but generates large amounts of data. Compressing this data is crucial for cost effectiveness. Previous compression methods relied on uniform scalar quantization (USQ). This study proposes replacing USQ with lattice vector quantization (LVQ) to improve compression performance. Scene-adaptive LVQ (SALVQ) optimizes the lattice basis for each scene, enhancing adaptability and rate-distortion (R-D) efficiency. SALVQ integrates seamlessly into existing 3DGS compression architectures, improving R-D performance with minimal modifications. It can dynamically adjust lattice density by scaling basis vectors, accommodating multiple bit rate targets within a single model. SALVQ eliminates the need for separate models for different compression levels, reducing training time and memory usage significantly. <div>
arXiv:2509.13482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is rapidly gaining popularity for its photorealistic rendering quality and real-time performance, but it generates massive amounts of data. Hence compressing 3DGS data is necessary for the cost effectiveness of 3DGS models. Recently, several anchor-based neural compression methods have been proposed, achieving good 3DGS compression performance. However, they all rely on uniform scalar quantization (USQ) due to its simplicity. A tantalizing question is whether more sophisticated quantizers can improve the current 3DGS compression methods with very little extra overhead and minimal change to the system. The answer is yes by replacing USQ with lattice vector quantization (LVQ). To better capture scene-specific characteristics, we optimize the lattice basis for each scene, improving LVQ's adaptability and R-D efficiency. This scene-adaptive LVQ (SALVQ) strikes a balance between the R-D efficiency of vector quantization and the low complexity of USQ. SALVQ can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS compression architectures, enhancing their R-D performance with minimal modifications and computational overhead. Moreover, by scaling the lattice basis vectors, SALVQ can dynamically adjust lattice density, enabling a single model to accommodate multiple bit rate targets. This flexibility eliminates the need to train separate models for different compression levels, significantly reducing training time and memory consumption.

Summary: <br />
Understanding group-level social interactions in public spaces is essential for urban planning and designing inclusive environments. The task of social group region detection involves interpreting complex visual cues related to interpersonal relationships. A three-stage pipeline called MINGLE (Modeling INterpersonal Group-Level Engagement) is proposed, combining human detection, depth estimation, VLM-based reasoning for social affiliation classification, and a spatial aggregation algorithm for group localization. A new dataset of 100k urban street-view images with annotations for individuals and groups is introduced, combining human-created labels and MINGLE pipeline outputs for comprehensive coverage of real-world scenarios. This dataset aims to support the social group region detection task and facilitate future research in the field. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Understanding group-level social interactions in public spaces is crucial for urban planning, informing the design of socially vibrant and inclusive environments. Detecting such interactions from images involves interpreting subtle visual cues such as relations, proximity, and co-movement - semantically complex signals that go beyond traditional object detection. To address this challenge, we introduce a social group region detection task, which requires inferring and spatially grounding visual regions defined by abstract interpersonal relations. We propose MINGLE (Modeling INterpersonal Group-Level Engagement), a modular three-stage pipeline that integrates: (1) off-the-shelf human detection and depth estimation, (2) VLM-based reasoning to classify pairwise social affiliation, and (3) a lightweight spatial aggregation algorithm to localize socially connected groups. To support this task and encourage future research, we present a new dataset of 100K urban street-view images annotated with bounding boxes and labels for both individuals and socially interacting groups. The annotations combine human-created labels and outputs from the MINGLE pipeline, ensuring semantic richness and broad coverage of real-world scenarios.

Summary: 
BiasMap is proposed as a model-agnostic framework for uncovering latent concept-level representational biases in stable diffusion models, particularly in text-to-image models. It leverages cross-attention attribution maps to reveal the entanglements between demographics and semantics in image generation. The framework quantifies the spatial demographics-semantics concept entanglement using Intersection over Union (IoU), offering insights into hidden biases. Furthermore, BiasMap is utilized for bias mitigation by modifying the latent noise space through energy-guided diffusion sampling, minimizing concept-level coupling during the denoising process. The study demonstrates that existing fairness interventions may address distributional biases but fail to disentangle concept-level coupling, while the proposed mitigation method effectively mitigates concept entanglement in image generation. <div>
arXiv:2509.13496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bias discovery is critical for black-box generative models, especiall text-to-image (TTI) models. Existing works predominantly focus on output-level demographic distributions, which do not necessarily guarantee concept representations to be disentangled post-mitigation. We propose BiasMap, a model-agnostic framework for uncovering latent concept-level representational biases in stable diffusion models. BiasMap leverages cross-attention attribution maps to reveal structural entanglements between demographics (e.g., gender, race) and semantics (e.g., professions), going deeper into representational bias during the image generation. Using attribution maps of these concepts, we quantify the spatial demographics-semantics concept entanglement via Intersection over Union (IoU), offering a lens into bias that remains hidden in existing fairness discovery approaches. In addition, we further utilize BiasMap for bias mitigation through energy-guided diffusion sampling that directly modifies latent noise space and minimizes the expected SoftIoU during the denoising process. Our findings show that existing fairness interventions may reduce the output distributional gap but often fail to disentangle concept-level coupling, whereas our mitigation method can mitigate concept entanglement in image generation while complementing distributional bias mitigation.

Abstract: The lack of flexible annotation tools has hindered the deployment of AI models in some scientific areas. Most existing image annotation software requires users to upload a precollected dataset, which limits support for on-demand pipelines and introduces unnecessary steps to acquire images. This constraint is particularly problematic in laboratory environments, where real-time data acquisition from instruments such as microscopes is increasingly common. In this work, we introduce \texttt{LivePixel}, a Python-based graphical user interface that integrates with imaging systems, such as webcams, microscopes, and others, to enable real-time image annotation. LivePyxel is designed to be easy to use through a simple interface that allows users to precisely delimit areas for annotation using tools commonly found in commercial graphics editing software. Of particular interest is the availability of B\'ezier splines and binary masks, and the software's capacity to work with non-destructive layers that enable high-performance editing. LivePyxel also integrates a wide compatibility across video devices, and it's optimized for object detection operations via the use of OpenCV in combination with high-performance libraries designed to handle matrix and linear algebra operations via Numpy effectively. LivePyxel facilitates seamless data collection and labeling, accelerating the development of AI models in experimental workflows. LivePyxel freely available at https://github.com/UGarCil/LivePyxel

<title>DEFT-VTON: Efficient Virtual Try-On with Consistent Generalised H-Transform</title>

<div> Keywords: Diffusion models, Virtual try-on, Fine-tuning, H-transform, Consistency loss

Summary:
DEFT-VTON introduces efficient fine-tuning using Doob's h-transform for adapting pre-trained models for virtual try-on (VTO) applications. By freezing most parameters and training a small h-transform network for conditional learning, DEFT significantly reduces the number of parameters that need training compared to traditional methods. Additionally, an adaptive consistency loss is proposed to further enhance performance and reduce inference time. This loss function combines consistency training with denoising score matching, resulting in a low-cost fine-tuning process for existing VTO models. Empirical results demonstrate that DEFT-VTON achieves state-of-the-art VTO performance with a minimal number of denoising steps, while maintaining competitive results. <div>
arXiv:2509.13506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models enable high-quality virtual try-on (VTO) with their established image synthesis abilities. Despite the extensive end-to-end training of large pre-trained models involved in current VTO methods, real-world applications often prioritize limited training and inference, serving, and deployment budgets for VTO. To solve this obstacle, we apply Doob's h-transform efficient fine-tuning (DEFT) for adapting large pre-trained unconditional models for downstream image-conditioned VTO abilities. DEFT freezes the pre-trained model's parameters and trains a small h-transform network to learn a conditional h-transform. The h-transform network allows training only 1.42 percent of the frozen parameters, compared to a baseline of 5.52 percent in traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).
  To further improve DEFT's performance and decrease existing models' inference time, we additionally propose an adaptive consistency loss. Consistency training distills slow but high-performing diffusion models into a fast one while retaining performance by enforcing consistencies along the inference path. Inspired by constrained optimization, instead of distillation, we combine the consistency loss and the denoising score matching loss in a data-adaptive manner for fine-tuning existing VTO models at a low cost. Empirical results show the proposed DEFT-VTON method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VTO tasks, with as few as 15 denoising steps, while maintaining competitive results.

<div> medical image enhancement, segmentation, deep learning, interpretable, FunKAN

Summary:
FunKAN is a novel neural framework designed for medical image processing, offering interpretable solutions by generalizing the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem onto functional spaces. It utilizes Fourier decomposition over Hermite functions to learn inner functions and overcome the limitations of traditional deep learning approaches. The framework is applied to tasks such as Gibbs ringing suppression in magnetic resonance images and binary medical segmentation on datasets like BUSI, GlaS, and CVC-ClinicDB for breast cancer, glands, and polyps detection. FunKAN demonstrates superior performance in both image enhancement (PSNR, TV) and segmentation (IoU, F1) compared to other Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based backbones. By bridging the gap between theoretical function approximation and medical image analysis, FunKAN presents a robust and interpretable solution for clinical applications. <div>
arXiv:2509.13508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image enhancement and segmentation are critical yet challenging tasks in modern clinical practice, constrained by artifacts and complex anatomical variations. Traditional deep learning approaches often rely on complex architectures with limited interpretability. While Kolmogorov-Arnold networks offer interpretable solutions, their reliance on flattened feature representations fundamentally disrupts the intrinsic spatial structure of imaging data. To address this issue we propose a Functional Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (FunKAN) -- a novel interpretable neural framework, designed specifically for image processing, that formally generalizes the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem onto functional spaces and learns inner functions using Fourier decomposition over the basis Hermite functions. We explore FunKAN on several medical image processing tasks, including Gibbs ringing suppression in magnetic resonance images, benchmarking on IXI dataset. We also propose U-FunKAN as state-of-the-art binary medical segmentation model with benchmarks on three medical datasets: BUSI (ultrasound images), GlaS (histological structures) and CVC-ClinicDB (colonoscopy videos), detecting breast cancer, glands and polyps, respectively. Experiments on those diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms other KAN-based backbones in both medical image enhancement (PSNR, TV) and segmentation (IoU, F1). Our work bridges the gap between theoretical function approximation and medical image analysis, offering a robust, interpretable solution for clinical applications.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.13515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hateful videos present serious risks to online safety and real-world well-being, necessitating effective detection methods. Although multimodal classification approaches integrating information from several modalities outperform unimodal ones, they typically neglect that even minimal hateful content defines a video's category. Specifically, they generally treat all content uniformly, instead of emphasizing the hateful components. Additionally, existing multimodal methods cannot systematically capture structured information in videos, limiting the effectiveness of multimodal fusion. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal dual-stream graph neural network model. It constructs an instance graph by separating the given video into several instances to extract instance-level features. Then, a complementary weight graph assigns importance weights to these features, highlighting hateful instances. Importance weights and instance features are combined to generate video labels. Our model employs a graph-based framework to systematically model structured relationships within and across modalities. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that our model is state-of-the-art in hateful video classification and has strong explainability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made a significant impact on rendering and reconstruction techniques. Current research predominantly focuses on improving rendering performance and reconstruction quality using high-performance desktop GPUs, largely overlooking applications for embedded platforms like micro air vehicles (MAVs). These devices, with their limited computational resources and memory, often face a trade-off between system performance and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we improve existing methods in terms of GPU memory usage while enhancing rendering quality. Specifically, to address redundant 3D Gaussian primitives in SLAM, we propose merging them in voxel space based on geometric similarity. This reduces GPU memory usage without impacting system runtime performance. Furthermore, rendering quality is improved by initializing 3D Gaussian primitives via Patch-Grid (PG) point sampling, enabling more accurate modeling of the entire scene. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on publicly available datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our improvements.

<div> Keywords: trajectory prediction, autonomous vehicles, out-of-distribution detection, quickest change detection, adaptive mechanisms

Summary:
In the field of autonomous vehicles, accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for safe operation. However, models may encounter shifts in data distribution when faced with rare or underrepresented traffic scenarios, leading to out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. While previous research has focused on OOD detection in computer vision tasks, trajectory-level OOD detection has been overlooked. A new framework is proposed to address this issue, incorporating adaptive mechanisms to enhance detection in complex driving environments. The framework accounts for evolving error distributions on in-distribution samples, resulting in improved detection delay and false alarm rates. Through empirical analysis on real-world datasets, the method outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency. This advancement offers a practical solution for reliable and driving-aware autonomy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.13577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction is central to the safe and seamless operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In deployment, however, prediction models inevitably face distribution shifts between training data and real-world conditions, where rare or underrepresented traffic scenarios induce out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. While most prior OOD detection research in AVs has concentrated on computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation, trajectory-level OOD detection remains largely underexplored. A recent study formulated this problem as a quickest change detection (QCD) task, providing formal guarantees on the trade-off between detection delay and false alarms [1]. Building on this foundation, we propose a new framework that introduces adaptive mechanisms to achieve robust detection in complex driving environments. Empirical analysis across multiple real-world datasets reveals that prediction errors -- even on in-distribution samples -- exhibit mode-dependent distributions that evolve over time with dataset-specific dynamics. By explicitly modeling these error modes, our method achieves substantial improvements in both detection delay and false alarm rates. Comprehensive experiments on established trajectory prediction benchmarks show that our framework significantly outperforms prior UQ- and vision-based OOD approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical path toward reliable, driving-aware autonomy.

The study also explores the relationship between CLAP, RANSAC, and Hough transforms. The generalized CLAP framework offers a versatile solution for handling noise and uncertainty in various fields.

Abstract: In previous work, we introduced a 2D localization algorithm called CLAP, Clustering to Localize Across $n$ Possibilities, which was used during our championship win in RoboCup 2024, an international autonomous humanoid soccer competition. CLAP is particularly recognized for its robustness against outliers, where clustering is employed to suppress noise and mitigate against erroneous feature matches. This clustering-based strategy provides an alternative to traditional outlier rejection schemes such as RANSAC, in which candidates are validated by reprojection error across all data points. In this paper, CLAP is extended to a more general framework beyond 2D localization, specifically to 3D localization and image stitching. We also show how CLAP, RANSAC, and Hough transforms are related. The generalization of CLAP is widely applicable to many different fields and can be a useful tool to deal with noise and uncertainty.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces SAMIR, a medical image registration framework that utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance feature extraction. SAM is pretrained on natural image datasets and can learn robust visual representations. SAMIR uses SAM's image encoder to extract structure-aware feature embeddings, improving modeling of anatomical consistency and deformation patterns. A 3D head refines features within the embedding space to adapt to local deformations. A Hierarchical Feature Consistency Loss guides coarse-to-fine feature matching for better anatomical alignment. SAMIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods on intra-subject cardiac image registration and inter-subject abdomen CT image registration datasets, achieving significant performance improvements. The source code will be made publicly available on GitHub after acceptance. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.13629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis. Deformations are often closely related to the morphological characteristics of tissues, making accurate feature extraction crucial. Recent weakly supervised methods improve registration by incorporating anatomical priors such as segmentation masks or landmarks, either as inputs or in the loss function. However, such weak labels are often not readily available, limiting their practical use. Motivated by the strong representation learning ability of visual foundation models, this paper introduces SAMIR, an efficient medical image registration framework that utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to enhance feature extraction. SAM is pretrained on large-scale natural image datasets and can learn robust, general-purpose visual representations. Rather than using raw input images, we design a task-specific adaptation pipeline using SAM's image encoder to extract structure-aware feature embeddings, enabling more accurate modeling of anatomical consistency and deformation patterns. We further design a lightweight 3D head to refine features within the embedding space, adapting to local deformations in medical images. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Feature Consistency Loss to guide coarse-to-fine feature matching and improve anatomical alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAMIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets for both intra-subject cardiac image registration and inter-subject abdomen CT image registration, achieving performance improvements of 2.68% on ACDC and 6.44% on the abdomen dataset. The source code will be publicly available on GitHub following the acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Accurate identification of deforestation from satellite images is essential in order to understand the geographical situation of an area. This paper introduces a new distributed approach to identify as well as locate deforestation across different clients using Federated Learning (FL). Federated Learning enables distributed network clients to collaboratively train a model while maintaining data privacy and security of the active users. In our framework, a client corresponds to an edge satellite center responsible for local data processing. Moreover, FL provides an advantage over centralized training method which requires combining data, thereby compromising with data security of the clients. Our framework leverages the FLOWER framework with RAY framework to execute the distributed learning workload. Furthermore, efficient client spawning is ensured by RAY as it can select definite amount of users to create an emulation environment. Our FL framework uses YOLOS-small (a Vision Transformer variant), Faster R-CNN with a ResNet50 backbone, and Faster R-CNN with a MobileNetV3 backbone models trained and tested on publicly available datasets. Our approach provides us a different view for image segmentation-based tasks on satellite imagery.

<div> Estimating metric relative camera pose, two-view pose estimation, GARPS framework, metric monocular depth estimator, Gaussian scene reconstructor<br />
Summary:<br />
Estimating metric relative camera pose is crucial for 3D reconstruction and localisation. Conventional methods struggle with wide baselines and textureless or reflective surfaces as they are not metric. The GARPS framework addresses this by aligning two independently reconstructed 3D scenes. By leveraging a metric monocular depth estimator and Gaussian scene reconstructor, GARPS obtains a metric 3D Gaussian Mixture Model for each image and refines the initial pose using a differentiable GMM alignment objective.

Abstract: Estimating metric relative camera pose from a pair of images is of great importance for 3D reconstruction and localisation. However, conventional two-view pose estimation methods are not metric, with camera translation known only up to a scale, and struggle with wide baselines and textureless or reflective surfaces. This paper introduces GARPS, a training-free framework that casts this problem as the direct alignment of two independently reconstructed 3D scenes. GARPS leverages a metric monocular depth estimator and a Gaussian scene reconstructor to obtain a metric 3D Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for each image. It then refines an initial pose from a feed-forward two-view pose estimator by optimising a differentiable GMM alignment objective. This objective jointly considers geometric structure, view-independent colour, anisotropic covariance, and semantic feature consistency, and is robust to occlusions and texture-poor regions without requiring explicit 2D correspondences. Extensive experiments on the Real\-Estate10K dataset demonstrate that GARPS outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art learning-based methods, including MASt3R. These results highlight the potential of bridging single-view perception with multi-view geometry to achieve robust and metric relative pose estimation.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a new efficient lookup operation as a basic operation for constructing neural networks. By using lookup tables instead of traditional multiplication operations, the proposed lookup networks are able to achieve higher efficiency in terms of energy consumption and inference speed. The lookup tables are constructed in a differentiable manner, allowing for end-to-end optimization. The research presents several training strategies to enhance the convergence of the lookup operation. Experimental results demonstrate that the lookup networks outperform traditional convolutional networks in tasks such as image classification, image super-resolution, and point cloud classification. The proposed method shows state-of-the-art performance on various tasks and data types, showcasing its effectiveness in improving computational efficiency without compromising performance.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are constructed with massive operations with different types and are highly computationally intensive. Among these operations, multiplication operation is higher in computational complexity and usually requires {more} energy consumption with longer inference time than other operations, which hinders the deployment of convolutional neural networks on mobile devices. In many resource-limited edge devices, complicated operations can be calculated via lookup tables to reduce computational cost. Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce a generic and efficient lookup operation which can be used as a basic operation for the construction of neural networks. Instead of calculating the multiplication of weights and activation values, simple yet efficient lookup operations are adopted to compute their responses. To enable end-to-end optimization of the lookup operation, we construct the lookup tables in a differentiable manner and propose several training strategies to promote their convergence. By replacing computationally expensive multiplication operations with our lookup operations, we develop lookup networks for the image classification, image super-resolution, and point cloud classification tasks. It is demonstrated that our lookup networks can benefit from the lookup operations to achieve higher efficiency in terms of energy consumption and inference speed while maintaining competitive performance to vanilla convolutional networks. Extensive experiments show that our lookup networks produce state-of-the-art performance on different tasks (both classification and regression tasks) and different data types (both images and point clouds).

Summary:
- The article introduces a novel semantic visual projector for Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) frameworks that combines the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM).
- Current patch-wise visual projectors struggle to balance reducing the number of visual tokens and preserving semantic clarity in RIS due to visual token redundancy.

Abstract: Recently, Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) frameworks that pair the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have achieved impressive results. However, adapting MLLM to segmentation is computationally intensive, primarily due to visual token redundancy. We observe that traditional patch-wise visual projectors struggle to strike a balance between reducing the number of visual tokens and preserving semantic clarity, often retaining overly long token sequences to avoid performance drops. Inspired by text tokenizers, we propose a novel semantic visual projector that leverages semantic superpixels generated by SAM to identify "visual words" in an image. By compressing and projecting semantic superpixels as visual tokens, our approach adaptively shortens the token sequence according to scene complexity while minimizing semantic loss in compression. To mitigate loss of information, we propose a semantic superpixel positional embedding to strengthen MLLM's awareness of superpixel geometry and position, alongside a semantic superpixel aggregator to preserve both fine-grained details inside superpixels and global context outside. Experiments show that our method cuts visual tokens by 93% without compromising performance, notably speeding up MLLM training and inference, and outperforming existing compressive visual projectors on RIS.

Summary:<br />
FishBEV is a novel Bird's Eye View segmentation framework designed specifically for fisheye cameras, addressing challenges such as geometric distortion, multi-view correspondences, and temporal dynamics. It introduces a Distortion-Resilient Multi-scale Extraction backbone for robust feature learning, an Uncertainty-aware Spatial Cross-Attention mechanism for reliable alignment, and a Distance-aware Temporal Self-Attention module for balancing near and far field context. Experimentation on the Synwoodscapes dataset showcases FishBEV's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines for fisheye BEV segmentation tasks. <div>
arXiv:2509.13681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a cornerstone technique for autonomous driving, Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation has recently achieved remarkable progress with pinhole cameras. However, it is non-trivial to extend the existing methods to fisheye cameras with severe geometric distortion, ambiguous multi-view correspondences and unstable temporal dynamics, all of which significantly degrade BEV performance. To address these challenges, we propose FishBEV, a novel BEV segmentation framework specifically tailored for fisheye cameras. This framework introduces three complementary innovations, including a Distortion-Resilient Multi-scale Extraction (DRME) backbone that learns robust features under distortion while preserving scale consistency, an Uncertainty-aware Spatial Cross-Attention (U-SCA) mechanism that leverages uncertainty estimation for reliable cross-view alignment, a Distance-aware Temporal Self-Attention (D-TSA) module that adaptively balances near field details and far field context to ensure temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on the Synwoodscapes dataset demonstrate that FishBEV consistently outperforms SOTA baselines, regarding the performance evaluation of FishBEV on the surround-view fisheye BEV segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Effective and interpretable classification of medical images is a challenge in computer-aided diagnosis, especially in resource-limited clinical settings. This study introduces spline-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for accurate medical image classification with limited, diverse datasets. The models include SBTAYLOR-KAN, integrating B-splines with Taylor series; SBRBF-KAN, combining B-splines with Radial Basis Functions; and SBWAVELET-KAN, embedding B-splines in Morlet wavelet transforms. These approaches leverage spline-based function approximation to capture both local and global nonlinearities. The models were evaluated on brain MRI, chest X-rays, tuberculosis X-rays, and skin lesion images without preprocessing, demonstrating the ability to learn directly from raw data. Extensive experiments, including cross-dataset validation and data reduction analysis, showed strong generalization and stability. SBTAYLOR-KAN achieved up to 98.93% accuracy, with a balanced F1-score, maintaining over 86% accuracy using only 30% of the training data across three datasets. Despite class imbalance in the skin cancer dataset, experiments on both imbalanced and balanced versions showed SBTAYLOR-KAN outperforming other models, achieving 68.22% accuracy. Unlike traditional CNNs, which require millions of parameters (e.g., ResNet50 with 24.18M), SBTAYLOR-KAN achieves comparable performance with just 2,872 trainable parameters, making it more suitable for constrained medical environments. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was used for interpretability, highlighting relevant regions in medical images. This framework provides a lightweight, interpretable, and generalizable solution for medical image classification, addressing the challenges of limited datasets and data-scarce scenarios in clinical AI applications.

Summary:<br /><br />The article discusses the misuse of generative models, specifically diffusion-based approaches, in replicating artistic styles, posing a threat to artists' creative labor. The study explores the sensitivity of cross-attention layers to artistic styles, proposing a protection strategy called StyleProtect to defend against fine-tuned diffusion models. By updating selected cross-attention layers, StyleProtect effectively safeguards unique styles of artworks and anime from malicious customization while maintaining imperceptibility. Experiments conducted on a curated dataset of artworks and anime demonstrate the method's promising performance in preventing style mimicry. This research aims to address the growing concern of protecting artists' original styles in the face of advancing generative models. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.13711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models, particularly diffusion-based approaches, has inadvertently facilitated their potential for misuse. Such models enable malicious exploiters to replicate artistic styles that capture an artist's creative labor, personal vision, and years of dedication in an inexpensive manner. This has led to a rise in the need and exploration of methods for protecting artworks against style mimicry. Although generic diffusion models can easily mimic an artistic style, finetuning amplifies this capability, enabling the model to internalize and reproduce the style with higher fidelity and control. We hypothesize that certain cross-attention layers exhibit heightened sensitivity to artistic styles. Sensitivity is measured through activation strengths of attention layers in response to style and content representations, and assessing their correlations with features extracted from external models. Based on our findings, we introduce an efficient and lightweight protection strategy, StyleProtect, that achieves effective style defense against fine-tuned diffusion models by updating only selected cross-attention layers. Our experiments utilize a carefully curated artwork dataset based on WikiArt, comprising representative works from 30 artists known for their distinctive and influential styles and cartoon animations from the Anita dataset. The proposed method demonstrates promising performance in safeguarding unique styles of artworks and anime from malicious diffusion customization, while maintaining competitive imperceptibility.

Summary: 
The paper introduces UM-Depth, a framework for monocular depth estimation that enhances accuracy in dynamic object boundaries and textureless regions. The framework combines motion- and uncertainty-aware refinement to address challenges caused by input data uncertainty. UM-Depth employs a teacher-student training strategy that embeds uncertainty estimation in the training pipeline and network architecture to improve supervision where photometric signals are weak. Unlike previous methods, UM-Depth utilizes optical flow exclusively within the teacher network during training, eliminating the need for additional labeling demands and any runtime cost. Experimental results on KITTI and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate UM-Depth's efficacy, achieving state-of-the-art results in self-supervised depth and pose estimation on KITTI datasets. <div>

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has been increasingly adopted in robotics and autonomous driving for its ability to infer scene geometry from a single camera. In self-supervised monocular depth estimation frameworks, the network jointly generates and exploits depth and pose estimates during training, thereby eliminating the need for depth labels. However, these methods remain challenged by uncertainty in the input data, such as low-texture or dynamic regions, which can cause reduced depth accuracy. To address this, we introduce UM-Depth, a framework that combines motion- and uncertainty-aware refinement to enhance depth accuracy at dynamic object boundaries and in textureless regions. Specifically, we develop a teacherstudent training strategy that embeds uncertainty estimation into both the training pipeline and network architecture, thereby strengthening supervision where photometric signals are weak. Unlike prior motion-aware approaches that incur inference-time overhead and rely on additional labels or auxiliary networks for real-time generation, our method uses optical flow exclusively within the teacher network during training, which eliminating extra labeling demands and any runtime cost. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our uncertainty-aware refinement. Overall, UM-Depth achieves state-of-the-art results in both self-supervised depth and pose estimation on the KITTI datasets.

Abstract: Recently, query-based methods have achieved remarkable performance in Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) by using textual static object queries to drive cross-modal alignment. However, these static queries are easily misled by distractors with similar appearance or motion, resulting in \emph{query selection bias}. To address this issue, we propose Triple Query Former (TQF), which factorizes the referring query into three specialized components: an appearance query for static attributes, an intra-frame interaction query for spatial relations, and an inter-frame motion query for temporal association. Instead of relying solely on textual embeddings, our queries are dynamically constructed by integrating both linguistic cues and visual guidance. Furthermore, we introduce two motion-aware aggregation modules that enhance object token representations: Intra-frame Interaction Aggregation incorporates position-aware interactions among objects within a single frame, while Inter-frame Motion Aggregation leverages trajectory-guided alignment across frames to ensure temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of TQF and the effectiveness of our structured query design and motion-aware aggregation modules.

By jointly training GREC and GRES, InstanceVG ensures consistent multi-granularity predictions and streamlines the process. It leverages instance queries to unify the predictions of instance-level boxes and masks and assigns each query a prior reference point for target matching, enhancing prediction consistency.

Abstract: Generalized visual grounding tasks, including Generalized Referring Expression Comprehension (GREC) and Segmentation (GRES), extend the classical visual grounding paradigm by accommodating multi-target and non-target scenarios. Specifically, GREC focuses on accurately identifying all referential objects at the coarse bounding box level, while GRES aims for achieve fine-grained pixel-level perception. However, existing approaches typically treat these tasks independently, overlooking the benefits of jointly training GREC and GRES to ensure consistent multi-granularity predictions and streamline the overall process. Moreover, current methods often treat GRES as a semantic segmentation task, neglecting the crucial role of instance-aware capabilities and the necessity of ensuring consistent predictions between instance-level boxes and masks. To address these limitations, we propose InstanceVG, a multi-task generalized visual grounding framework equipped with instance-aware capabilities, which leverages instance queries to unify the joint and consistency predictions of instance-level boxes and masks. To the best of our knowledge, InstanceVG is the first framework to simultaneously tackle both GREC and GRES while incorporating instance-aware capabilities into generalized visual grounding. To instantiate the framework, we assign each instance query a prior reference point, which also serves as an additional basis for target matching. This design facilitates consistent predictions of points, boxes, and masks for the same instance. Extensive experiments obtained on ten datasets across four tasks demonstrate that InstanceVG achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly surpassing the existing methods in various evaluation metrics. The code and model will be publicly available at https://github.com/Dmmm1997/InstanceVG.

Summary:
The article introduces FMFA, a novel framework for Text-to-Image Person Retrieval that enhances global matching through explicit fine-grained alignment and implicit relational reasoning. By incorporating Adaptive Similarity Distribution Matching (A-SDM) and Explicit Fine-grained Alignment (EFA) modules, FMFA is able to address the challenge of achieving effective alignment between textual and visual modalities. A-SDM rectifies unmatched positive sample pairs by pulling them closer in the joint embedding space, while EFA strengthens explicit cross-modal interactions for precise alignment. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches on public datasets and does not require additional supervision. The code for FMFA is available on GitHub for further exploration and development.

arXiv:2509.13754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-Image Person Retrieval (TIPR) is a cross-modal matching task that aims to retrieve the most relevant person images based on a given text query. The key challenge in TIPR lies in achieving effective alignment between textual and visual modalities within a common latent space. To address this challenge, prior approaches incorporate attention mechanisms for implicit cross-modal local alignment. However, they lack the ability to verify whether all local features are correctly aligned. Moreover, existing methods primarily focus on hard negative samples during model updates, with the goal of refining distinctions between positive and negative pairs, often neglecting incorrectly matched positive pairs. To alleviate these issues, we propose FMFA, a cross-modal Full-Mode Fine-grained Alignment framework, which enhances global matching through explicit fine-grained alignment and existing implicit relational reasoning -- hence the term ``full-mode" -- without requiring additional supervision. Specifically, we design an Adaptive Similarity Distribution Matching (A-SDM) module to rectify unmatched positive sample pairs. A-SDM adaptively pulls the unmatched positive pairs closer in the joint embedding space, thereby achieving more precise global alignment. Additionally, we introduce an Explicit Fine-grained Alignment (EFA) module, which makes up for the lack of verification capability of implicit relational reasoning. EFA strengthens explicit cross-modal fine-grained interactions by sparsifying the similarity matrix and employs a hard coding method for local alignment. Our proposed method is evaluated on three public datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance among all global matching methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/yinhao1102/FMFA.

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced in color editing in text-driven image editing due to the ambiguity and discreteness of natural language. It highlights the limitations of linearly interpolating embedding vectors for color changes and the lack of control over color range in output images. To address these issues, a color mapping module is introduced, which models the correspondence between text embedding space and image RGB values. This module predicts the embedding vector based on a given RGB value, allowing precise color control while maintaining semantic consistency. Users can specify a target RGB range for generating images with continuous color variations within the desired range. Experimental results show improved color continuity and controllability, enhancing the overall performance of the method in color editing.

Abstract: In recent years, text-driven image editing has made significant progress. However, due to the inherent ambiguity and discreteness of natural language, color editing still faces challenges such as insufficient precision and difficulty in achieving continuous control. Although linearly interpolating the embedding vectors of different textual descriptions can guide the model to generate a sequence of images with varying colors, this approach lacks precise control over the range of color changes in the output images. Moreover, the relationship between the interpolation coefficient and the resulting image color is unknown and uncontrollable. To address these issues, we introduce a color mapping module that explicitly models the correspondence between the text embedding space and image RGB values. This module predicts the corresponding embedding vector based on a given RGB value, enabling precise color control of the generated images while maintaining semantic consistency. Users can specify a target RGB range to generate images with continuous color variations within the desired range, thereby achieving finer-grained, continuous, and controllable color editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method performs well in terms of color continuity and controllability.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating images from text prompts, but their output quality and safety still depend heavily on how prompts are phrased. Existing safety methods typically refine prompts using large language models (LLMs), but they overlook the images produced, which can result in unsafe outputs or unnecessary changes to already safe prompts. To address this, we propose an iterative prompt refinement algorithm that uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to analyze both the input prompts and the generated images. By leveraging visual feedback, our method refines prompts more effectively, improving safety while maintaining user intent and reliability comparable to existing LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset labeled with both textual and visual safety signals using off-the-shelf multi-modal LLM, enabling supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach produces safer outputs without compromising alignment with user intent, offering a practical solution for generating safer T2I content.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new approach called Task-Aware Image Signal Processing (TA-ISP) for processing RAW sensor data in computer vision applications. The traditional methods of enhancing visual quality or using dense convolutional pipelines for processing RAW data have limitations in terms of computational overhead and representational capacity. TA-ISP addresses these issues by generating lightweight modulation operators that can control image statistics at different scales, allowing for a wider range of spatial transformations while keeping memory and computation requirements low. The proposed framework improves object detection and segmentation accuracy on various benchmarks, particularly in challenging conditions like nighttime. It also reduces the parameter count and inference time, making it suitable for deployment on devices with limited resources.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.13762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing trend in computer vision towards exploiting RAW sensor data, which preserves richer information compared to conventional low-bit RGB images. Early studies mainly focused on enhancing visual quality, while more recent efforts aim to leverage the abundant information in RAW data to improve the performance of visual perception tasks such as object detection and segmentation. However, existing approaches still face two key limitations: large-scale ISP networks impose heavy computational overhead, while methods based on tuning traditional ISP pipelines are restricted by limited representational capacity.To address these issues, we propose Task-Aware Image Signal Processing (TA-ISP), a compact RAW-to-RGB framework that produces task-oriented representations for pretrained vision models. Instead of heavy dense convolutional pipelines, TA-ISP predicts a small set of lightweight, multi-scale modulation operators that act at global, regional, and pixel scales to reshape image statistics across different spatial extents. This factorized control significantly expands the range of spatially varying transforms that can be represented while keeping memory usage, computation, and latency tightly constrained. Evaluated on several RAW-domain detection and segmentation benchmarks under both daytime and nighttime conditions, TA-ISP consistently improves downstream accuracy while markedly reducing parameter count and inference time, making it well suited for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Visual degradation caused by rain streak artifacts in low-light conditions significantly hampers the performance of nighttime surveillance and autonomous navigation. Existing image deraining techniques are primarily designed for daytime conditions and perform poorly under nighttime illumination due to the spatial heterogeneity of rain distribution and the impact of light-dependent stripe visibility. In this paper, we propose a novel Nighttime Deraining Location-enhanced Perceptual Network(NDLPNet) that effectively captures the spatial positional information and density distribution of rain streaks in low-light environments. Specifically, we introduce a Position Perception Module (PPM) to capture and leverage spatial contextual information from input data, enhancing the model's capability to identify and recalibrate the importance of different feature channels. The proposed nighttime deraining network can effectively remove the rain streaks as well as preserve the crucial background information. Furthermore, We construct a night scene rainy (NSR) dataset comprising 900 image pairs, all based on real-world nighttime scenes, providing a new benchmark for nighttime deraining task research. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental evaluations on both existing datasets and the NSR dataset consistently demonstrate our method outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in nighttime deraining tasks.

Abstract: Accurately segmenting articulatory structures in real-time magnetic resonance imaging (rtMRI) remains challenging, as most existing methods rely almost entirely on visual cues. Yet synchronized acoustic and phonological signals provide complementary context that can enrich visual information and improve precision. In this paper, we introduce VocSegMRI, a multimodal framework that integrates video, audio, and phonological inputs through cross-attention fusion for dynamic feature alignment. To further enhance cross-modal representation, we incorporate a contrastive learning objective that improves segmentation performance even when the audio modality is unavailable at inference. Evaluated on a sub-set of USC-75 rtMRI dataset, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Dice score of 0.95 and a 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD_95) of 4.20 mm, outperforming both unimodal and multimodal baselines. Ablation studies confirm the contributions of cross-attention and contrastive learning to segmentation precision and robustness. These results highlight the value of integrative multimodal modeling for accurate vocal tract analysis.

arXiv:2509.13768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative technologies advance, visual content has evolved into a complex mix of natural and AI-generated images, driving the need for more efficient coding techniques that prioritize perceptual quality. Traditional codecs and learned methods struggle to maintain subjective quality at high compression ratios, while existing generative approaches face challenges in visual fidelity and generalization. To this end, we propose a novel generative coding framework leveraging diffusion priors to enhance compression performance at low bitrates. Our approach employs a pre-optimized encoder to generate generalized compressed-domain representations, integrated with the pretrained model's internal features via a lightweight adapter and an attentive fusion module. This framework effectively leverages existing pretrained diffusion models and enables efficient adaptation to different pretrained models for new requirements with minimal retraining costs. We also introduce a distribution renormalization method to further enhance reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments show that our method (1) outperforms existing methods in visual fidelity across low bitrates, (2) improves compression performance by up to 79% over H.266/VVC, and (3) offers an efficient solution for AI-generated content while being adaptable to broader content types.

Summary:
AdaThinkDrive is a new Vision Language Action framework designed for autonomous driving. It incorporates a dual-mode reasoning mechanism inspired by fast and slow thinking, allowing the model to selectively apply reasoning based on scenario complexity. The framework is pretrained on large-scale autonomous driving datasets and fine-tuned using a two-mode dataset for supervised training. An Adaptive Think Reward strategy is implemented to encourage the model to use reasoning effectively. Experimental results on the Navsim benchmark demonstrate that AdaThinkDrive outperforms vision-only baselines in terms of decision-making accuracy, achieving a high PDMS score. Furthermore, the framework shows improvements in both efficiency and accuracy compared to baseline models, highlighting its ability to balance the two factors through adaptive reasoning.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.13769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While reasoning technology like Chain of Thought (CoT) has been widely adopted in Vision Language Action (VLA) models, it demonstrates promising capabilities in end to end autonomous driving. However, recent efforts to integrate CoT reasoning often fall short in simple scenarios, introducing unnecessary computational overhead without improving decision quality. To address this, we propose AdaThinkDrive, a novel VLA framework with a dual mode reasoning mechanism inspired by fast and slow thinking. First, our framework is pretrained on large scale autonomous driving (AD) scenarios using both question answering (QA) and trajectory datasets to acquire world knowledge and driving commonsense. During supervised fine tuning (SFT), we introduce a two mode dataset, fast answering (w/o CoT) and slow thinking (with CoT), enabling the model to distinguish between scenarios that require reasoning. Furthermore, an Adaptive Think Reward strategy is proposed in conjunction with the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which rewards the model for selectively applying CoT by comparing trajectory quality across different reasoning modes. Extensive experiments on the Navsim benchmark show that AdaThinkDrive achieves a PDMS of 90.3, surpassing the best vision only baseline by 1.7 points. Moreover, ablations show that AdaThinkDrive surpasses both the never Think and always Think baselines, improving PDMS by 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. It also reduces inference time by 14% compared to the always Think baseline, demonstrating its ability to balance accuracy and efficiency through adaptive reasoning.

Summary: 
In the pursuit of improving deepfake detection accuracy, precise localization of manipulated regions is becoming increasingly important. Current classification-based detection methods often struggle with accurately pinpointing forged areas. By incorporating both local detail and global semantic context, a novel approach has been proposed to independently predict manipulated regions. This approach utilizes morphological operations to fuse outputs, effectively reducing noise and improving spatial coherence. Through extensive experiments, the effectiveness of each module in enhancing forgery localization accuracy and robustness has been demonstrated. This innovative method addresses the challenges of accurately localizing forged areas and highlights the significance of collaborating both local and global perspectives in deepfake detection. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.13776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the pursuit of higher accuracy in deepfake detection remains a central goal, there is an increasing demand for precise localization of manipulated regions. Despite the remarkable progress made in classification-based detection, accurately localizing forged areas remains a significant challenge. A common strategy is to incorporate forged region annotations during model training alongside manipulated images. However, such approaches often neglect the complementary nature of local detail and global semantic context, resulting in suboptimal localization performance. Moreover, an often-overlooked aspect is the fusion strategy between local and global predictions. Naively combining the outputs from both branches can amplify noise and errors, thereby undermining the effectiveness of the localization.
  To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that independently predicts manipulated regions using both local and global perspectives. We employ morphological operations to fuse the outputs, effectively suppressing noise while enhancing spatial coherence. Extensive experiments reveal the effectiveness of each module in improving the accuracy and robustness of forgery localization.

arXiv:2509.13784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras capture asynchronous pixel-level brightness changes with microsecond temporal resolution, offering unique advantages for high-speed vision tasks. Existing methods often convert event streams into intermediate representations such as frames, voxel grids, or point clouds, which inevitably require predefined time windows and thus introduce window latency. Meanwhile, pointwise detection methods face computational challenges that prevent real-time efficiency due to their high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Variable-Rate Spatial Event Mamba, a novel architecture that directly processes raw event streams without intermediate representations. Our method introduces a lightweight causal spatial neighborhood encoder to efficiently capture local geometric relations, followed by Mamba-based state space models for scalable temporal modeling with linear complexity. During inference, a controller adaptively adjusts the processing speed according to the event rate, achieving an optimal balance between window latency and inference latency.

<div> Block-Wise Caching, Diffusion Transformers, Video Generation, Latency Reduction, Computational Efficiency
Summary:
Block-Wise Caching (BWCache) is proposed as a training-free method to accelerate video generation using Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). By dynamically caching and reusing features from DiT blocks across diffusion timesteps, BWCache addresses the latency issues associated with sequential denoising processes. An indicator is introduced to trigger feature reuse only when differences between block features at adjacent timesteps fall below a threshold, minimizing redundant computations while maintaining visual fidelity. Experimental results show that BWCache can achieve up to 2.24x speedup in video diffusion models while preserving visual quality. This approach effectively reduces computational redundancy in DiT blocks, resulting in faster video generation without compromising on visual fidelity. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.13789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have established them as the state-of-the-art method for video generation. However, their inherently sequential denoising process results in inevitable latency, limiting real-world applicability. Existing acceleration methods either compromise visual quality due to architectural modifications or fail to reuse intermediate features at proper granularity. Our analysis reveals that DiT blocks are the primary contributors to inference latency. Across diffusion timesteps, the feature variations of DiT blocks exhibit a U-shaped pattern with high similarity during intermediate timesteps, which suggests substantial computational redundancy. In this paper, we propose Block-Wise Caching (BWCache), a training-free method to accelerate DiT-based video generation. BWCache dynamically caches and reuses features from DiT blocks across diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce a similarity indicator that triggers feature reuse only when the differences between block features at adjacent timesteps fall below a threshold, thereby minimizing redundant computations while maintaining visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on several video diffusion models demonstrate that BWCache achieves up to 2.24$\times$ speedup with comparable visual quality.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a novel Supervised Domain Adaptation (SDA) framework for Spacecraft Pose Estimation (SPE). SPE is crucial for tasks like rendezvous and docking in space. While current pipelines perform well on synthetic data, they struggle with real-world imagery due to domain gaps. The SDA framework optimizes domain-invariant representations and task-specific risk using both labeled synthetic and limited real data to enhance generalization under domain shift. Experiment results on the SPEED+ benchmark show that the proposed method consistently outperforms other baselines with only 5% labeled target data. The framework is lightweight, adaptable to different backbones, and computationally efficient, promising robust spacecraft pose estimation in real-world space scenarios.<br />  
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.13792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacecraft Pose Estimation (SPE) is a fundamental capability for autonomous space operations such as rendezvous, docking, and in-orbit servicing. Hybrid pipelines that combine object detection, keypoint regression, and Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solvers have recently achieved strong results on synthetic datasets, yet their performance deteriorates sharply on real or lab-generated imagery due to the persistent synthetic-to-real domain gap. Existing unsupervised domain adaptation approaches aim to mitigate this issue but often underperform when a modest number of labeled target samples are available. In this work, we propose the first Supervised Domain Adaptation (SDA) framework tailored for SPE keypoint regression. Building on the Learning Invariant Representation and Risk (LIRR) paradigm, our method jointly optimizes domain-invariant representations and task-specific risk using both labeled synthetic and limited labeled real data, thereby reducing generalization error under domain shift. Extensive experiments on the SPEED+ benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms source-only, fine-tuning, and oracle baselines. Notably, with only 5% labeled target data, our method matches or surpasses oracle performance trained on larger fractions of labeled data. The framework is lightweight, backbone-agnostic, and computationally efficient, offering a practical pathway toward robust and deployable spacecraft pose estimation in real-world space environments.

Abstract: Vision-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) localization systems have been extensively investigated for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments. However, existing retrieval-based approaches face limitations in dataset availability and persistent challenges including suboptimal real-time performance, environmental sensitivity, and limited generalization capability, particularly in dynamic or temporally varying environments. To overcome these limitations, we present a large-scale Multi-Altitude Flight Segments dataset (MAFS) for variable altitude scenarios and propose a novel Semantic-Weighted Adaptive Particle Filter (SWA-PF) method. This approach integrates robust semantic features from both UAV-captured images and satellite imagery through two key innovations: a semantic weighting mechanism and an optimized particle filtering architecture. Evaluated using our dataset, the proposed method achieves 10x computational efficiency gain over feature extraction methods, maintains global positioning errors below 10 meters, and enables rapid 4 degree of freedom (4-DoF) pose estimation within seconds using accessible low-resolution satellite maps.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces a novel approach called Masked Feature Modeling (MFM) for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in semantic segmentation. MFM performs feature masking and reconstruction in the feature space, aligning its learning target with the main segmentation task. A lightweight auxiliary module, Rebuilder, facilitates effective reconstruction without adding computational overhead at test time. MFM leverages the segmentation decoder to classify the reconstructed features, tightly coupling the auxiliary objective with the pixel-wise prediction task. Extensive experiments across various architectures and UDA benchmarks show that MFM consistently improves segmentation performance. This approach is simple, efficient, and can be generalized for unsupervised domain-adaptive semantic segmentation. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2509.13801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation aims to transfer models from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. While auxiliary self-supervised tasks-particularly contrastive learning-have improved feature discriminability, masked modeling approaches remain underexplored in this setting, largely due to architectural incompatibility and misaligned optimization objectives. We propose Masked Feature Modeling (MFM), a novel auxiliary task that performs feature masking and reconstruction directly in the feature space. Unlike existing masked modeling methods that reconstruct low-level inputs or perceptual features (e.g., HOG or visual tokens), MFM aligns its learning target with the main segmentation task, ensuring compatibility with standard architectures like DeepLab and DAFormer without modifying the inference pipeline. To facilitate effective reconstruction, we introduce a lightweight auxiliary module, Rebuilder, which is trained jointly but discarded during inference, adding zero computational overhead at test time. Crucially, MFM leverages the segmentation decoder to classify the reconstructed features, tightly coupling the auxiliary objective with the pixel-wise prediction task to avoid interference with the primary task. Extensive experiments across various architectures and UDA benchmarks demonstrate that MFM consistently enhances segmentation performance, offering a simple, efficient, and generalizable strategy for unsupervised domain-adaptive semantic segmentation.

arXiv:2509.13809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classification of pixel spectra of hyperspectral images, i.e. spectral classification, is used in many fields ranging from agricultural, over medical to remote sensing applications and is currently also expanding to areas such as autonomous driving. Even though for full hyperspectral images the best-performing methods exploit spatial-spectral information, performing classification solely on spectral information has its own advantages, e.g. smaller model size and thus less data required for training. Moreover, spectral information is complementary to spatial information and improvements on either part can be used to improve spatial-spectral approaches in the future. Recently, 1D-Justo-LiuNet was proposed as a particularly efficient model with very few parameters, which currently defines the state of the art in spectral classification. However, we show that with limited training data the model performance deteriorates. Therefore, we investigate MiniROCKET and HDC-MiniROCKET for spectral classification to mitigate that problem. The model extracts well-engineered features without trainable parameters in the feature extraction part and is therefore less vulnerable to limited training data. We show that even though MiniROCKET has more parameters it outperforms 1D-Justo-LiuNet in limited data scenarios and is mostly on par with it in the general case

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has been employed to alleviate the need for extensive labeled data for histopathology image segmentation, but existing methods struggle with noisy pseudo-labels due to ambiguous gland boundaries and morphological misclassification. This paper introduces Semi-MOE, to the best of our knowledge, the first multi-task Mixture-of-Experts framework for semi-supervised histopathology image segmentation. Our approach leverages three specialized expert networks: A main segmentation expert, a signed distance field regression expert, and a boundary prediction expert, each dedicated to capturing distinct morphological features. Subsequently, the Multi-Gating Pseudo-labeling module dynamically aggregates expert features, enabling a robust fuse-and-refine pseudo-labeling mechanism. Furthermore, to eliminate manual tuning while dynamically balancing multiple learning objectives, we propose an Adaptive Multi-Objective Loss. Extensive experiments on GlaS and CRAG benchmarks show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in low-label settings, highlighting the potential of MoE-based architectures in advancing semi-supervised segmentation. Our code is available at https://github.com/vnlvi2k3/Semi-MoE.

Abstract: Object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) significantly impedes their real-world applicability. As the primary component for accurately interpreting visual information, the choice of visual encoder is pivotal. We hypothesize that the diverse training paradigms employed by different visual encoders instill them with distinct inductive biases, which leads to their diverse hallucination performances. Existing benchmarks typically focus on coarse-grained hallucination detection and fail to capture the diverse hallucinations elaborated in our hypothesis. To systematically analyze these effects, we introduce VHBench-10, a comprehensive benchmark with approximately 10,000 samples for evaluating LVLMs across ten fine-grained hallucination categories. Our evaluations confirm encoders exhibit unique hallucination characteristics. Building on these insights and the suboptimality of simple feature fusion, we propose VisionWeaver, a novel Context-Aware Routing Network. It employs global visual features to generate routing signals, dynamically aggregating visual features from multiple specialized experts. Comprehensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of VisionWeaver in significantly reducing hallucinations and improving overall model performance.

Abstract: Many recent approaches in representation learning implicitly assume that uncorrelated views of a data point are sufficient to learn meaningful representations for various downstream tasks. In this work, we challenge this assumption and demonstrate that meaningful structure in the latent space does not emerge naturally. Instead, it must be explicitly induced. We propose a method that aligns representations from different views of the data to align complementary information without inducing false positives. Our experiments show that our proposed self-supervised learning method, Consistent View Alignment, improves performance for downstream tasks, highlighting the critical role of structured view alignment in learning effective representations. Our method achieved first and second place in the MICCAI 2025 SSL3D challenge when using a Primus vision transformer and ResEnc convolutional neural network, respectively.

Abstract: Feature caching has recently emerged as a promising method for diffusion model acceleration. It effectively alleviates the inefficiency problem caused by high computational requirements by caching similar features in the inference process of the diffusion model. In this paper, we analyze existing feature caching methods from the perspective of information utilization, and point out that relying solely on historical information will lead to constrained accuracy and speed performance. And we propose a novel paradigm that introduces future information via self-speculation based on the information similarity at the same time step across different iteration times. Based on this paradigm, we present \textit{SpecDiff}, a training-free multi-level feature caching strategy including a cached feature selection algorithm and a multi-level feature classification algorithm. (1) Feature selection algorithm based on self-speculative information. \textit{SpecDiff} determines a dynamic importance score for each token based on self-speculative information and historical information, and performs cached feature selection through the importance score. (2) Multi-level feature classification algorithm based on feature importance scores. \textit{SpecDiff} classifies tokens by leveraging the differences in feature importance scores and introduces a multi-level feature calculation strategy. Extensive experiments show that \textit{SpecDiff} achieves average 2.80 \times, 2.74 \times , and 3.17\times speedup with negligible quality loss in Stable Diffusion 3, 3.5, and FLUX compared to RFlow on NVIDIA A800-80GB GPU. By merging speculative and historical information, \textit{SpecDiff} overcomes the speedup-accuracy trade-off bottleneck, pushing the Pareto frontier of speedup and accuracy in the efficient diffusion model inference.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a compact dataset from the original large-scale one, enabling highly efficient learning while preserving competitive model performance. However, traditional techniques primarily capture low-level visual features, neglecting the high-level semantic and structural information inherent in images. In this paper, we propose EDITS, a novel framework that exploits the implicit textual semantics within the image data to achieve enhanced distillation. First, external texts generated by a Vision Language Model (VLM) are fused with image features through a Global Semantic Query module, forming the prior clustered buffer. Local Semantic Awareness then selects representative samples from the buffer to construct image and text prototypes, with the latter produced by guiding a Large Language Model (LLM) with meticulously crafted prompt. Ultimately, Dual Prototype Guidance strategy generates the final synthetic dataset through a diffusion model. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our method.Source code is available in: https://github.com/einsteinxia/EDITS.

<title>LamiGauss: Pitching Radiative Gaussian for Sparse-View X-ray Laminography Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: X-ray Computed Laminography (CL) is essential for non-destructive inspection of plate-like structures in applications such as microchips and composite battery materials, where traditional computed tomography (CT) struggles due to geometric constraints. However, reconstructing high-quality volumes from laminographic projections remains challenging, particularly under highly sparse-view acquisition conditions. In this paper, we propose a reconstruction algorithm, namely LamiGauss, that combines Gaussian Splatting radiative rasterization with a dedicated detector-to-world transformation model incorporating the laminographic tilt angle. LamiGauss leverages an initialization strategy that explicitly filters out common laminographic artifacts from the preliminary reconstruction, preventing redundant Gaussians from being allocated to false structures and thereby concentrating model capacity on representing the genuine object. Our approach effectively optimizes directly from sparse projections, enabling accurate and efficient reconstruction with limited data. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method over existing techniques. LamiGauss uses only 3$\%$ of full views to achieve superior performance over the iterative method optimized on a full dataset.

Abstract: Recent emergence of memory-based video segmentation methods such as SAM2 has led to models with excellent performance in segmentation tasks, achieving leading results on numerous benchmarks. However, these modes are not fully adjusted for visual object tracking, where distractors (i.e., objects visually similar to the target) pose a key challenge. In this paper we propose a distractor-aware drop-in memory module and introspection-based management method for SAM2, leading to DAM4SAM. Our design effectively reduces the tracking drift toward distractors and improves redetection capability after object occlusion. To facilitate the analysis of tracking in the presence of distractors, we construct DiDi, a Distractor-Distilled dataset. DAM4SAM outperforms SAM2.1 on thirteen benchmarks and sets new state-of-the-art results on ten. Furthermore, integrating the proposed distractor-aware memory into a real-time tracker EfficientTAM leads to 11% improvement and matches tracking quality of the non-real-time SAM2.1-L on multiple tracking and segmentation benchmarks, while integration with edge-based tracker EdgeTAM delivers 4% performance boost, demonstrating a very good generalization across architectures.

Abstract: Pelvic fractures pose significant diagnostic challenges, particularly in cases where fracture signs are subtle or invisible on standard radiographs. To address this, we introduce PelFANet, a dual-stream attention network that fuses raw pelvic X-rays with segmented bone images to improve fracture classification. The network em-ploys Fused Attention Blocks (FABlocks) to iteratively exchange and refine fea-tures from both inputs, capturing global context and localized anatomical detail. Trained in a two-stage pipeline with a segmentation-guided approach, PelFANet demonstrates superior performance over conventional methods. On the AMERI dataset, it achieves 88.68% accuracy and 0.9334 AUC on visible fractures, while generalizing effectively to invisible fracture cases with 82.29% accuracy and 0.8688 AUC, despite not being trained on them. These results highlight the clini-cal potential of anatomy-aware dual-input architectures for robust fracture detec-tion, especially in scenarios with subtle radiographic presentations.

Abstract: Hand tracking holds great promise for intuitive interaction paradigms, but frame-based methods often struggle to meet the requirements of accuracy, low latency, and energy efficiency, especially in resource-constrained settings such as Extended Reality (XR) devices. Event cameras provide $\mu$s-level temporal resolution at mW-level power by asynchronously sensing brightness changes. In this work, we present EvHand-FPV, a lightweight framework for egocentric First-Person-View 3D hand tracking from a single event camera. We construct an event-based FPV dataset that couples synthetic training data with 3D labels and real event data with 2D labels for evaluation to address the scarcity of egocentric benchmarks. EvHand-FPV also introduces a wrist-based region of interest (ROI) that localizes the hand region via geometric cues, combined with an end-to-end mapping strategy that embeds ROI offsets into the network to reduce computation without explicit reconstruction, and a multi-task learning strategy with an auxiliary geometric feature head that improves representations without test-time overhead. On our real FPV test set, EvHand-FPV improves 2D-AUCp from 0.77 to 0.85 while reducing parameters from 11.2M to 1.2M by 89% and FLOPs per inference from 1.648G to 0.185G by 89%. It also maintains a competitive 3D-AUCp of 0.84 on synthetic data. These results demonstrate accurate and efficient egocentric event-based hand tracking suitable for on-device XR applications. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/zen5x5/EvHand-FPV.

<title>White Aggregation and Restoration for Few-shot 3D Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Few-Shot 3D Point Cloud Segmentation (FS-PCS) aims to predict per-point labels for an unlabeled point cloud, given only a few labeled examples. To extract discriminative representations from the limited support set, existing methods have constructed prototypes using conventional algorithms such as farthest point sampling. However, we point out that its initial randomness significantly affects FS-PCS performance and that the prototype generation process remains underexplored despite its prevalence. This motivates us to investigate an advanced prototype generation method based on attention mechanism. Despite its potential, we found that vanilla module suffers from the distributional gap between learnable prototypical tokens and support features. To overcome this, we propose White Aggregation and Restoration Module (WARM), which resolves the misalignment by sandwiching cross-attention between whitening and coloring transformations. Specifically, whitening aligns the support features to prototypical tokens before attention process, and subsequently coloring restores the original distribution to the attended tokens. This simple yet effective design enables robust attention, thereby generating representative prototypes by capturing the semantic relationships among support features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with a significant margin on multiple FS-PCS benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have manifested strong visual question answering capability. However, they still struggle with aligning the rationale and the generated answer, leading to inconsistent reasoning and incorrect responses. To this end, this paper introduces the Self-Rationale Calibration (SRC) framework to iteratively calibrate the alignment between rationales and answers. SRC begins by employing a lightweight "rationale fine-tuning" approach, which modifies the model's response format to require a rationale before deriving an answer without explicit prompts. Next, SRC searches for a diverse set of candidate responses from the fine-tuned LVLMs for each sample, followed by a proposed pairwise scoring strategy using a tailored scoring model, R-Scorer, to evaluate both rationale quality and factual consistency of candidates. Based on a confidence-weighted preference curation process, SRC decouples the alignment calibration into a preference fine-tuning manner, leading to significant improvements of LVLMs in perception, reasoning, and generalization across multiple benchmarks. Our results emphasize the rationale-oriented alignment in exploring the potential of LVLMs.

<title>Towards Robust Defense against Customization via Protective Perturbation Resistant to Diffusion-based Purification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13922</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.13922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have become prominent in visual synthesis tasks due to their powerful customization capabilities, which also introduce significant security risks, including deepfakes and copyright infringement. In response, a class of methods known as protective perturbation emerged, which mitigates image misuse by injecting imperceptible adversarial noise. However, purification can remove protective perturbations, thereby exposing images again to the risk of malicious forgery. In this work, we formalize the anti-purification task, highlighting challenges that hinder existing approaches, and propose a simple diagnostic protective perturbation named AntiPure. AntiPure exposes vulnerabilities of purification within the "purification-customization" workflow, owing to two guidance mechanisms: 1) Patch-wise Frequency Guidance, which reduces the model's influence over high-frequency components in the purified image, and 2) Erroneous Timestep Guidance, which disrupts the model's denoising strategy across different timesteps. With additional guidance, AntiPure embeds imperceptible perturbations that persist under representative purification settings, achieving effective post-customization distortion. Experiments show that, as a stress test for purification, AntiPure achieves minimal perceptual discrepancy and maximal distortion, outperforming other protective perturbation methods within the purification-customization workflow.

<title>Noise-Level Diffusion Guidance: Well Begun is Half Done</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art image generation. However, the random Gaussian noise used to start the diffusion process influences the final output, causing variations in image quality and prompt adherence. Existing noise-level optimization approaches generally rely on extra dataset construction, additional networks, or backpropagation-based optimization, limiting their practicality. In this paper, we propose Noise Level Guidance (NLG), a simple, efficient, and general noise-level optimization approach that refines initial noise by increasing the likelihood of its alignment with general guidance - requiring no additional training data, auxiliary networks, or backpropagation. The proposed NLG approach provides a unified framework generalizable to both conditional and unconditional diffusion models, accommodating various forms of diffusion-level guidance. Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach enhances output generation quality and input condition adherence. By seamlessly integrating with existing guidance methods while maintaining computational efficiency, our method establishes NLG as a practical and scalable enhancement to diffusion models.

Abstract: Visual counting is a fundamental yet challenging task, especially when users need to count objects of a specific type in complex scenes. While recent models, including class-agnostic counting models and large vision-language models (VLMs), show promise in counting tasks, their ability to perform fine-grained, intent-driven counting remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce PairTally, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate fine-grained visual counting. Each of the 681 high-resolution images in PairTally contains two object categories, requiring models to distinguish and count based on subtle differences in shape, size, color, or semantics. The dataset includes both inter-category (distinct categories) and intra-category (closely related subcategories) settings, making it suitable for rigorous evaluation of selective counting capabilities. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art models, including exemplar-based methods, language-prompted models, and large VLMs. Our results show that despite recent advances, current models struggle to reliably count what users intend, especially in fine-grained and visually ambiguous cases. PairTally provides a new foundation for diagnosing and improving fine-grained visual counting systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.14001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce MOCHA (Multi-modal Objects-aware Cross-arcHitecture Alignment), a knowledge distillation approach that transfers region-level multimodal semantics from a large vision-language teacher (e.g., LLaVa) into a lightweight vision-only object detector student (e.g., YOLO). A translation module maps student features into a joint space, where the training of the student and translator is guided by a dual-objective loss that enforces both local alignment and global relational consistency. Unlike prior approaches focused on dense or global alignment, MOCHA operates at the object level, enabling efficient transfer of semantics without modifying the teacher or requiring textual input at inference. We validate our method across four personalized detection benchmarks under few-shot regimes. Results show consistent gains over baselines, with a +10.1 average score improvement. Despite its compact architecture, MOCHA reaches performance on par with larger multimodal models, proving its suitability for real-world deployment.

<title>Performance Optimization of YOLO-FEDER FusionNet for Robust Drone Detection in Visually Complex Environments</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.14012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drone detection in visually complex environments remains challenging due to background clutter, small object scale, and camouflage effects. While generic object detectors like YOLO exhibit strong performance in low-texture scenes, their effectiveness degrades in cluttered environments with low object-background separability. To address these limitations, this work presents an enhanced iteration of YOLO-FEDER FusionNet -- a detection framework that integrates generic object detection with camouflage object detection techniques. Building upon the original architecture, the proposed iteration introduces systematic advancements in training data composition, feature fusion strategies, and backbone design. Specifically, the training process leverages large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic data, complemented by a small set of real-world samples, to enhance robustness under visually complex conditions. The contribution of intermediate multi-scale FEDER features is systematically evaluated, and detection performance is comprehensively benchmarked across multiple YOLO-based backbone configurations. Empirical results indicate that integrating intermediate FEDER features, in combination with backbone upgrades, contributes to notable performance improvements. In the most promising configuration -- YOLO-FEDER FusionNet with a YOLOv8l backbone and FEDER features derived from the DWD module -- these enhancements lead to a FNR reduction of up to 39.1 percentage points and a mAP increase of up to 62.8 percentage points at an IoU threshold of 0.5, compared to the initial baseline.

Abstract: We introduce SAIL-VL2, an open-suite vision-language foundation model (LVM) for comprehensive multimodal understanding and reasoning. As the successor to SAIL-VL, SAIL-VL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance at the 2B and 8B parameter scales across diverse image and video benchmarks, demonstrating strong capabilities from fine-grained perception to complex reasoning. Three core innovations drive its effectiveness. First, a large-scale data curation pipeline with scoring and filtering strategies enhances both quality and distribution across captioning, OCR, QA, and video data, improving training efficiency. Second, a progressive training framework begins with a powerful pre-trained vision encoder (SAIL-ViT), advances through multimodal pre-training, and culminates in a thinking-fusion SFT-RL hybrid paradigm that systematically strengthens model capabilities. Third, architectural advances extend beyond dense LLMs to efficient sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) designs. With these contributions, SAIL-VL2 demonstrates competitive performance across 106 datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging reasoning benchmarks such as MMMU and MathVista. Furthermore, on the OpenCompass leaderboard, SAIL-VL2-2B ranks first among officially released open-source models under the 4B parameter scale, while serving as an efficient and extensible foundation for the open-source multimodal community.

Abstract: Almost 30% of prostate cancer (PCa) patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP) experience biochemical recurrence (BCR), characterized by increased prostate specific antigen (PSA) and associated with increased mortality. Accurate early prediction of BCR, at the time of RP, would contribute to prompt adaptive clinical decision-making and improved patient outcomes. In this work, we propose prostate cancer BCR prediction via fused multi-modal embeddings (PROFUSEme), which learns cross-modal interactions of clinical, radiology, and pathology data, following an intermediate fusion configuration in combination with Cox Proportional Hazard regressors. Quantitative evaluation of our proposed approach reveals superior performance, when compared with late fusion configurations, yielding a mean C-index of 0.861 ($\sigma=0.112$) on the internal 5-fold nested cross-validation framework, and a C-index of 0.7103 on the hold out data of CHIMERA 2025 challenge validation leaderboard.

Abstract: We introduce Wan-Animate, a unified framework for character animation and replacement. Given a character image and a reference video, Wan-Animate can animate the character by precisely replicating the expressions and movements of the character in the video to generate high-fidelity character videos. Alternatively, it can integrate the animated character into the reference video to replace the original character, replicating the scene's lighting and color tone to achieve seamless environmental integration. Wan-Animate is built upon the Wan model. To adapt it for character animation tasks, we employ a modified input paradigm to differentiate between reference conditions and regions for generation. This design unifies multiple tasks into a common symbolic representation. We use spatially-aligned skeleton signals to replicate body motion and implicit facial features extracted from source images to reenact expressions, enabling the generation of character videos with high controllability and expressiveness. Furthermore, to enhance environmental integration during character replacement, we develop an auxiliary Relighting LoRA. This module preserves the character's appearance consistency while applying the appropriate environmental lighting and color tone. Experimental results demonstrate that Wan-Animate achieves state-of-the-art performance. We are committed to open-sourcing the model weights and its source code.

Abstract: Current multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms typically overlook issues inherent in low-quality videos, leading to significant degradation in tracking performance when confronted with real-world image deterioration. Therefore, advancing the application of MOT algorithms in real-world low-quality video scenarios represents a critical and meaningful endeavor. To address the challenges posed by low-quality scenarios, inspired by vision-language models, this paper proposes a Visual Semantic Enhancement-guided Multi-Object Tracking framework (VSE-MOT). Specifically, we first design a tri-branch architecture that leverages a vision-language model to extract global visual semantic information from images and fuse it with query vectors. Subsequently, to further enhance the utilization of visual semantic information, we introduce the Multi-Object Tracking Adapter (MOT-Adapter) and the Visual Semantic Fusion Module (VSFM). The MOT-Adapter adapts the extracted global visual semantic information to suit multi-object tracking tasks, while the VSFM improves the efficacy of feature fusion. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in real-world low-quality video scenarios. Its tracking performance metrics outperform those of existing methods by approximately 8% to 20%, while maintaining robust performance in conventional scenarios.

<title>AD-DINOv3: Enhancing DINOv3 for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection with Anomaly-Aware Calibration</title>

arXiv:2509.14084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) seeks to identify anomalies from arbitrary novel categories, offering a scalable and annotation-efficient solution. Traditionally, most ZSAD works have been based on the CLIP model, which performs anomaly detection by calculating the similarity between visual and text embeddings. Recently, vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have demonstrated strong transferable representation capabilities. In this work, we are the first to adapt DINOv3 for ZSAD. However, this adaptation presents two key challenges: (i) the domain bias between large-scale pretraining data and anomaly detection tasks leads to feature misalignment; and (ii) the inherent bias toward global semantics in pretrained representations often leads to subtle anomalies being misinterpreted as part of the normal foreground objects, rather than being distinguished as abnormal regions. To overcome these challenges, we introduce AD-DINOv3, a novel vision-language multimodal framework designed for ZSAD. Specifically, we formulate anomaly detection as a multimodal contrastive learning problem, where DINOv3 is employed as the visual backbone to extract patch tokens and a CLS token, and the CLIP text encoder provides embeddings for both normal and abnormal prompts. To bridge the domain gap, lightweight adapters are introduced in both modalities, enabling their representations to be recalibrated for the anomaly detection task. Beyond this baseline alignment, we further design an Anomaly-Aware Calibration Module (AACM), which explicitly guides the CLS token to attend to anomalous regions rather than generic foreground semantics, thereby enhancing discriminability. Extensive experiments on eight industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that AD-DINOv3 consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods, verifying its superiority as a general zero-shot anomaly detection framework.

Abstract: Weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing (AVVP) seeks to detect audible, visible, and audio-visual events without temporal annotations. Previous work has emphasized refining global predictions through contrastive or collaborative learning, but neglected stable segment-level supervision and class-aware cross-modal alignment. To address this, we propose two strategies: (1) an exponential moving average (EMA)-guided pseudo supervision framework that generates reliable segment-level masks via adaptive thresholds or top-k selection, offering stable temporal guidance beyond video-level labels; and (2) a class-aware cross-modal agreement (CMA) loss that aligns audio and visual embeddings at reliable segment-class pairs, ensuring consistency across modalities while preserving temporal structure. Evaluations on LLP and UnAV-100 datasets shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across multiple metrics.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning through masked autoencoders has attracted great attention for remote sensing (RS) foundation model (FM) development, enabling improved representation learning across diverse sensors and downstream tasks. However, existing RS FMs often either suffer from substantial computational complexity during both training and inference or exhibit limited representational capacity. These issues restrict their practical applicability in RS. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptation for enhancing the efficiency of RS FMs by integrating the Soft mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism into the FM. The integration of Soft MoEs into the FM allows modality-specific expert specialization alongside shared cross-sensor representation learning. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptation, we apply it on the Cross-Sensor Masked Autoencoder (CSMAE) model, resulting in the Cross-Sensor Mixture-of-Experts (CSMoE) model. In addition, we introduce a thematic-climatic descriptor-driven sampling strategy for the construction of a representative and diverse training set to train our CSMoE model. Extensive experiments on scene classification, semantic segmentation, and content-based image retrieval demonstrate that our adaptation yields a reduction in computational requirements while maintaining or improving representational performance. Compared to state-of-the-art RS FMs, CSMoE achieves a superior trade-off between representational capacity, accuracy, and computational efficiency. On average, CSMoE achieves more than twice the computational efficiency of existing RS FMs, while maintaining competitive performance across all experiments. These results show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptation for creating computationally efficient RS FMs. The code for the model, the training set creation, and the model weights will be available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/csmoe.

Abstract: Accurate histopathological diagnosis often requires multiple differently stained tissue sections, a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and environmentally taxing due to the use of multiple chemical stains. Recently, virtual staining has emerged as a promising alternative that is faster, tissue-conserving, and environmentally friendly. However, existing virtual staining methods face significant challenges in clinical applications, primarily due to their reliance on well-aligned paired data. Obtaining such data is inherently difficult because chemical staining processes can distort tissue structures, and a single tissue section cannot undergo multiple staining procedures without damage or loss of information. As a result, most available virtual staining datasets are either unpaired or roughly paired, making it difficult for existing methods to achieve accurate pixel-level supervision. To address this challenge, we propose a robust virtual staining framework featuring cascaded registration mechanisms to resolve spatial mismatches between generated outputs and their corresponding ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across five datasets, achieving an average improvement of 3.2% on internal datasets and 10.1% on external datasets. Moreover, in datasets with substantial misalignment, our approach achieves a remarkable 23.8% improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio compared to baseline models. The exceptional robustness of the proposed method across diverse datasets simplifies the data acquisition process for virtual staining and offers new insights for advancing its development.

Abstract: Digital beautification through social media filters has become increasingly popular, raising concerns about the reliability of facial images and videos and the effectiveness of automated face analysis. This issue is particularly critical for digital manipulation detectors, systems aiming at distinguishing between genuine and manipulated data, especially in cases involving deepfakes and morphing attacks designed to deceive humans and automated facial recognition. This study examines whether beauty filters impact the performance of deepfake and morphing attack detectors. We perform a comprehensive analysis, evaluating multiple state-of-the-art detectors on benchmark datasets before and after applying various smoothing filters. Our findings reveal performance degradation, highlighting vulnerabilities introduced by facial enhancements and underscoring the need for robust detection models resilient to such alterations.

Abstract: This paper reviews the MARS2 2025 Challenge on Multimodal Reasoning. We aim to bring together different approaches in multimodal machine learning and LLMs via a large benchmark. We hope it better allows researchers to follow the state-of-the-art in this very dynamic area. Meanwhile, a growing number of testbeds have boosted the evolution of general-purpose large language models. Thus, this year's MARS2 focuses on real-world and specialized scenarios to broaden the multimodal reasoning applications of MLLMs. Our organizing team released two tailored datasets Lens and AdsQA as test sets, which support general reasoning in 12 daily scenarios and domain-specific reasoning in advertisement videos, respectively. We evaluated 40+ baselines that include both generalist MLLMs and task-specific models, and opened up three competition tracks, i.e., Visual Grounding in Real-world Scenarios (VG-RS), Visual Question Answering with Spatial Awareness (VQA-SA), and Visual Reasoning in Creative Advertisement Videos (VR-Ads). Finally, 76 teams from the renowned academic and industrial institutions have registered and 40+ valid submissions (out of 1200+) have been included in our ranking lists. Our datasets, code sets (40+ baselines and 15+ participants' methods), and rankings are publicly available on the MARS2 workshop website and our GitHub organization page https://github.com/mars2workshop/, where our updates and announcements of upcoming events will be continuously provided.

Abstract: Imagine living in a world composed solely of primitive shapes, could you still recognise familiar objects? Recent studies have shown that abstract images-constructed by primitive shapes-can indeed convey visual semantic information to deep learning models. However, representations obtained from such images often fall short compared to those derived from traditional raster images. In this paper, we study the reasons behind this performance gap and investigate how much high-level semantic content can be captured at different abstraction levels. To this end, we introduce the Hierarchical Abstraction Image Dataset (HAID), a novel data collection that comprises abstract images generated from normal raster images at multiple levels of abstraction. We then train and evaluate conventional vision systems on HAID across various tasks including classification, segmentation, and object detection, providing a comprehensive study between rasterised and abstract image representations. We also discuss if the abstract image can be considered as a potentially effective format for conveying visual semantic information and contributing to vision tasks.

Abstract: Vision-centric Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception holds considerable promise for autonomous driving. Recent studies have prioritized efficiency or accuracy enhancements, yet the issue of domain shift has been overlooked, leading to substantial performance degradation upon transfer. We identify major domain gaps in real-world cross-domain scenarios and initiate the first effort to address the Domain Adaptation (DA) challenge in multi-view 3D object detection for BEV perception. Given the complexity of BEV perception approaches with their multiple components, domain shift accumulation across multi-geometric spaces (e.g., 2D, 3D Voxel, BEV) poses a significant challenge for BEV domain adaptation. In this paper, we introduce an innovative geometric-aware teacher-student framework, BEVUDA++, to diminish this issue, comprising a Reliable Depth Teacher (RDT) and a Geometric Consistent Student (GCS) model. Specifically, RDT effectively blends target LiDAR with dependable depth predictions to generate depth-aware information based on uncertainty estimation, enhancing the extraction of Voxel and BEV features that are essential for understanding the target domain. To collaboratively reduce the domain shift, GCS maps features from multiple spaces into a unified geometric embedding space, thereby narrowing the gap in data distribution between the two domains. Additionally, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-guided Exponential Moving Average (UEMA) to further reduce error accumulation due to domain shifts informed by previously obtained uncertainty guidance. To demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we execute comprehensive experiments in four cross-domain scenarios, securing state-of-the-art performance in BEV 3D object detection tasks, e.g., 12.9\% NDS and 9.5\% mAP enhancement on Day-Night adaptation.

<title>Where Do Tokens Go? Understanding Pruning Behaviors in STEP at High Resolutions</title>

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation but are hindered by high computational and memory costs. To address this, we propose STEP (SuperToken and Early-Pruning), a hybrid token-reduction framework that combines dynamic patch merging and token pruning to enhance efficiency without significantly compromising accuracy. At the core of STEP is dCTS, a lightweight CNN-based policy network that enables flexible merging into superpatches. Encoder blocks integrate also early-exits to remove high-confident supertokens, lowering computational load. We evaluate our method on high-resolution semantic segmentation benchmarks, including images up to 1024 x 1024, and show that when dCTS is applied alone, the token count can be reduced by a factor of 2.5 compared to the standard 16 x 16 pixel patching scheme. This yields a 2.6x reduction in computational cost and a 3.4x increase in throughput when using ViT-Large as the backbone. Applying the full STEP framework further improves efficiency, reaching up to a 4x reduction in computational complexity and a 1.7x gain in inference speed, with a maximum accuracy drop of no more than 2.0%. With the proposed STEP configurations, up to 40% of tokens can be confidently predicted and halted before reaching the final encoder layer.

Abstract: High temporal resolution is essential for capturing fine-grained details in video understanding. However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and benchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or keyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise avoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to redundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While this trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like lecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and requires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense Video Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by reducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are also limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore propose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed for dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual Tokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated Tokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during tokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2) Semantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions within a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics. Experiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales positively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal information and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video understanding.

Abstract: While recent advancements in vision-language models have improved video understanding, diagnosing their capacity for deep, narrative comprehension remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks often test short-clip recognition or use template-based questions, leaving a critical gap in evaluating fine-grained reasoning over long-form narrative content. To address these gaps, we introduce $\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$, a comprehensive benchmark for long-form movie understanding. Our dataset comprises 3,119 multiple-choice question-answer pairs derived from 1,805 scenes across 200 diverse movies, spanning five novel fine-grained contextual reasoning categories. We use GPT-4o to generate diverse, context-rich questions by integrating visual descriptions, captions, scene titles, and summaries, which require deep narrative understanding. To ensure high-quality evaluation, our pipeline incorporates a two-stage filtering process: Context-Independence filtering ensures questions require video context, while Contextual Veracity filtering validates factual consistency against the movie content, mitigating hallucinations. Experiments show that existing MLLMs struggle on $\mathsf{Cin\acute{e}aste}$; our analysis reveals that long-range temporal reasoning is a primary bottleneck, with the top open-source model achieving only 63.15\% accuracy. This underscores significant challenges in fine-grained contextual understanding and the need for advancements in long-form movie comprehension.

Abstract: Exams are a fundamental test of expert-level intelligence and require integrated understanding, reasoning, and generation. Existing exam-style benchmarks mainly focus on understanding and reasoning tasks, and current generation benchmarks emphasize the illustration of world knowledge and visual concepts, neglecting the evaluation of rigorous drawing exams. We introduce GenExam, the first benchmark for multidisciplinary text-to-image exams, featuring 1,000 samples across 10 subjects with exam-style prompts organized under a four-level taxonomy. Each problem is equipped with ground-truth images and fine-grained scoring points to enable a precise evaluation of semantic correctness and visual plausibility. Experiments show that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-Image-1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image achieve less than 15% strict scores, and most models yield almost 0%, suggesting the great challenge of our benchmark. By framing image generation as an exam, GenExam offers a rigorous assessment of models' ability to integrate knowledge, reasoning, and generation, providing insights on the path to general AGI.

<title>3D Reconstruction of Coronary Vessel Trees from Biplanar X-Ray Images Using a Geometric Approach</title>

Abstract: X-ray angiography is widely used in cardiac interventions to visualize coronary vessels, assess integrity, detect stenoses and guide treatment. We propose a framework for reconstructing 3D vessel trees from biplanar X-ray images which are extracted from two X-ray videos captured at different C-arm angles. The proposed framework consists of three main components: image segmentation, motion phase matching, and 3D reconstruction. An automatic video segmentation method for X-ray angiography to enable semantic segmentation for image segmentation and motion phase matching. The goal of the motion phase matching is to identify a pair of X-ray images that correspond to a similar respiratory and cardiac motion phase to reduce errors in 3D reconstruction. This is achieved by tracking a stationary object such as a catheter or lead within the X-ray video. The semantic segmentation approach assigns different labels to different object classes enabling accurate differentiation between blood vessels, balloons, and catheters. Once a suitable image pair is selected, key anatomical landmarks (vessel branching points and endpoints) are matched between the two views using a heuristic method that minimizes reconstruction errors. This is followed by a novel geometric reconstruction algorithm to generate the 3D vessel tree. The algorithm computes the 3D vessel centrelines by determining the intersection of two 3D surfaces. Compared to traditional methods based on epipolar constraints, the proposed approach simplifies there construction workflow and improves overall accuracy. We trained and validated our segmentation method on 62 X-ray angiography video sequences. On the test set, our method achieved a segmentation accuracy of 0.703. The 3D reconstruction framework was validated by measuring the reconstruction error of key anatomical landmarks, achieving a reprojection errors of 0.62mm +/- 0.38mm.

Abstract: Glioblastoma is the most prevalent primary brain malignancy, distinguished by its highly invasive behavior and exceptionally high rates of recurrence. Conventional radiation therapy, which employs uniform treatment margins, fails to account for patient-specific anatomical and biological factors that critically influence tumor cell migration. To address this limitation, numerous computational models of glioblastoma growth have been developed, enabling generation of tumor cell distribution maps extending beyond radiographically visible regions and thus informing more precise treatment strategies. However, despite encouraging preliminary findings, the clinical adoption of these growth models remains limited. To bridge this translational gap and accelerate both model development and clinical validation, we introduce PREDICT-GBM, a comprehensive integrated pipeline and dataset for modeling and evaluation. This platform enables systematic benchmarking of state-of-the-art tumor growth models using an expert-curated clinical dataset comprising 255 subjects with complete tumor segmentations and tissue characterization maps. Our analysis demonstrates that personalized radiation treatment plans derived from tumor growth predictions achieved superior recurrence coverage compared to conventional uniform margin approaches for two of the evaluated models. This work establishes a robust platform for advancing and systematically evaluating cutting-edge tumor growth modeling approaches, with the ultimate goal of facilitating clinical translation and improving patient outcomes.

Abstract: Fontan palliation for univentricular congenital heart disease progresses to hemodynamic failure with complex flow patterns poorly characterized by conventional 2D imaging. Current assessment relies on fluoroscopic angiography, providing limited 3D geometric information essential for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and surgical planning.
  A multi-step AI pipeline was developed utilizing Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash (2.5B parameters) for systematic, iterative processing of fluoroscopic angiograms through transformer-based neural architecture. The pipeline encompasses medical image preprocessing, vascular segmentation, contrast enhancement, artifact removal, and virtual hemodynamic flow visualization within 2D projections. Final views were processed through Tencent's Hunyuan3D-2mini (384M parameters) for stereolithography file generation.
  The pipeline successfully generated geometrically optimized 2D projections from single-view angiograms after 16 processing steps using a custom web interface. Initial iterations contained hallucinated vascular features requiring iterative refinement to achieve anatomically faithful representations. Final projections demonstrated accurate preservation of complex Fontan geometry with enhanced contrast suitable for 3D conversion. AI-generated virtual flow visualization identified stagnation zones in central connections and flow patterns in branch arteries. Complete processing required under 15 minutes with second-level API response times.
  This approach demonstrates clinical feasibility of generating CFD-suitable geometries from routine angiographic data, enabling 3D generation and rapid virtual flow visualization for cursory insights prior to full CFD simulation. While requiring refinement cycles for accuracy, this establishes foundation for democratizing advanced geometric and hemodynamic analysis using readily available imaging data.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex visual understanding across scientific and reasoning tasks. While performance benchmarking has advanced our understanding of these capabilities, the critical dimension of uncertainty quantification has received insufficient attention. Therefore, unlike prior conformal prediction studies that focused on limited settings, we conduct a comprehensive uncertainty benchmarking study, evaluating 16 state-of-the-art VLMs (open and closed-source) across 6 multimodal datasets with 3 distinct scoring functions. Our findings demonstrate that larger models consistently exhibit better uncertainty quantification; models that know more also know better what they don't know. More certain models achieve higher accuracy, while mathematical and reasoning tasks elicit poorer uncertainty performance across all models compared to other domains. This work establishes a foundation for reliable uncertainty evaluation in multimodal systems.

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in automotive cabin sounds is critical for ensuring vehicle quality and maintaining passenger comfort. In many real-world settings, this task is more appropriately framed as an unsupervised learning problem rather than the supervised case due to the scarcity or complete absence of labeled faulty data. In such an unsupervised setting, the model is trained exclusively on healthy samples and detects anomalies as deviations from normal behavior. However, in the absence of labeled faulty samples for validation and the limited reliability of commonly used metrics, such as validation reconstruction error, effective model selection remains a significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, a domain-knowledge-informed approach for model selection is proposed, in which proxy-anomalies engineered through structured perturbations of healthy spectrograms are used in the validation set to support model selection. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a high-fidelity electric vehicle dataset comprising healthy and faulty cabin sounds across five representative fault types viz., Imbalance, Modulation, Whine, Wind, and Pulse Width Modulation. This dataset, generated using advanced sound synthesis techniques, and validated via expert jury assessments, has been made publicly available to facilitate further research. Experimental evaluations on the five fault cases demonstrate the selection of optimal models using proxy-anomalies, significantly outperform conventional model selection strategies.

Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most commonly performed imaging investigation. In the UK, many centres experience reporting delays due to radiologist workforce shortages. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools capable of distinguishing normal from abnormal CXRs have emerged as a potential solution. If normal CXRs could be safely identified and reported without human input, a substantial portion of radiology workload could be reduced.
  This article examines the feasibility and implications of autonomous AI reporting of normal CXRs. Key issues include defining normal, ensuring generalisability across populations, and managing the sensitivity-specificity trade-off. It also addresses legal and regulatory challenges, such as compliance with IR(ME)R and GDPR, and the lack accountability frameworks for errors. Further considerations include the impact on radiologists practice, the need for robust post-market surveillance, and incorporation of patient perspectives. While the benefits are clear, adoption must be cautious.

<title>Semantic 3D Reconstructions with SLAM for Central Airway Obstruction</title>

Abstract: Central airway obstruction (CAO) is a life-threatening condition with increasing incidence, caused by tumors in and outside of the airway. Traditional treatment methods such as bronchoscopy and electrocautery can be used to remove the tumor completely; however, these methods carry a high risk of complications. Recent advances allow robotic interventions with lesser risk. The combination of robot interventions with scene understanding and mapping also opens up the possibilities for automation. We present a novel pipeline that enables real-time, semantically informed 3D reconstructions of the central airway using monocular endoscopic video.
  Our approach combines DROID-SLAM with a segmentation model trained to identify obstructive tissues. The SLAM module reconstructs the 3D geometry of the airway in real time, while the segmentation masks guide the annotation of obstruction regions within the reconstructed point cloud. To validate our pipeline, we evaluate the reconstruction quality using ex vivo models.
  Qualitative and quantitative results show high similarity between ground truth CT scans and the 3D reconstructions (0.62 mm Chamfer distance). By integrating segmentation directly into the SLAM workflow, our system produces annotated 3D maps that highlight clinically relevant regions in real time. High-speed capabilities of the pipeline allows quicker reconstructions compared to previous work, reflecting the surgical scene more accurately.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate semantic segmentation with real-time monocular SLAM for endoscopic CAO scenarios. Our framework is modular and can generalize to other anatomies or procedures with minimal changes, offering a promising step toward autonomous robotic interventions.

<title>Cross-Distribution Diffusion Priors-Driven Iterative Reconstruction for Sparse-View CT</title>

Abstract: Sparse-View CT (SVCT) reconstruction enhances temporal resolution and reduces radiation dose, yet its clinical use is hindered by artifacts due to view reduction and domain shifts from scanner, protocol, or anatomical variations, leading to performance degradation in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. In this work, we propose a Cross-Distribution Diffusion Priors-Driven Iterative Reconstruction (CDPIR) framework to tackle the OOD problem in SVCT. CDPIR integrates cross-distribution diffusion priors, derived from a Scalable Interpolant Transformer (SiT), with model-based iterative reconstruction methods. Specifically, we train a SiT backbone, an extension of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, to establish a unified stochastic interpolant framework, leveraging Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) across multiple datasets. By randomly dropping the conditioning with a null embedding during training, the model learns both domain-specific and domain-invariant priors, enhancing generalizability. During sampling, the globally sensitive transformer-based diffusion model exploits the cross-distribution prior within the unified stochastic interpolant framework, enabling flexible and stable control over multi-distribution-to-noise interpolation paths and decoupled sampling strategies, thereby improving adaptation to OOD reconstruction. By alternating between data fidelity and sampling updates, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior detail preservation in SVCT reconstructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDPIR significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly under OOD conditions, highlighting its robustness and potential clinical value in challenging imaging scenarios.

Abstract: Robust object pose estimation is essential for manipulation and interaction tasks in robotics, particularly in scenarios where visual data is limited or sensitive to lighting, occlusions, and appearances. Tactile sensors often offer limited and local contact information, making it challenging to reconstruct the pose from partial data. Our approach uses sensorimotor exploration to actively control a robot hand to interact with the object. We train with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to explore and collect tactile data. The collected 3D point clouds are used to iteratively refine the object's shape and pose. In our setup, one hand holds the object steady while the other performs active exploration. We show that our method can actively explore an object's surface to identify critical pose features without prior knowledge of the object's geometry. Supplementary material and more demonstrations will be provided at https://amirshahid.github.io/BimanualTactilePose .

Abstract: Understanding how spontaneous brain activity relates to stimulus-driven neural responses is a fundamental challenge in cognitive neuroscience. While task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures localized stimulus-evoked brain activation, its acquisition is costly, time-consuming, and difficult to scale across populations. In contrast, resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) is task-free and abundant, but lacks direct interpretability. We introduce Rest2Visual, a conditional generative model that predicts visually evoked fMRI (ve-fMRI) from resting-state input and 2D visual stimuli. It follows a volumetric encoder--decoder design, where multiscale 3D features from rs-fMRI are modulated by image embeddings via adaptive normalization, enabling spatially accurate, stimulus-specific activation synthesis. To enable model training, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset from the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD), aligning each rs-fMRI volume with stimulus images and their corresponding ve-fMRI activation maps. Quantitative evaluation shows that the predicted activations closely match ground truth across standard similarity and representational metrics, and support successful image reconstruction in downstream decoding. Notably, the predicted maps preserve subject-specific structure, demonstrating the model's capacity to generate individualized functional surrogates. Our results provide compelling evidence that individualized spontaneous neural activity can be transformed into stimulus-aligned representations, opening new avenues for scalable, task-free functional brain modeling.

Abstract: We propose LLM-Interleaved (LLM-I), a flexible and dynamic framework that reframes interleaved image-text generation as a tool-use problem. LLM-I is designed to overcome the "one-tool" bottleneck of current unified models, which are limited to synthetic imagery and struggle with tasks requiring factual grounding or programmatic precision. Our framework empowers a central LLM or MLLM agent to intelligently orchestrate a diverse toolkit of specialized visual tools, including online image search, diffusion-based generation, code execution, and image editing. The agent is trained to select and apply these tools proficiently via a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that features a hybrid reward system combining rule-based logic with judgments from LLM and MLLM evaluators. Trained on a diverse new dataset using four different model backbones, LLM-I demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by a large margin across four benchmarks. We also introduce a novel test-time scaling strategy that provides further performance gains. Project Page: https://github.com/ByteDance-BandAI/LLM-I.

<title>InterKey: Cross-modal Intersection Keypoints for Global Localization on OpenStreetMap</title>

Abstract: Reliable global localization is critical for autonomous vehicles, especially in environments where GNSS is degraded or unavailable, such as urban canyons and tunnels. Although high-definition (HD) maps provide accurate priors, the cost of data collection, map construction, and maintenance limits scalability. OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers a free and globally available alternative, but its coarse abstraction poses challenges for matching with sensor data. We propose InterKey, a cross-modal framework that leverages road intersections as distinctive landmarks for global localization. Our method constructs compact binary descriptors by jointly encoding road and building imprints from point clouds and OSM. To bridge modality gaps, we introduce discrepancy mitigation, orientation determination, and area-equalized sampling strategies, enabling robust cross-modal matching. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that InterKey achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming recent baselines by a large margin. The framework generalizes to sensors that can produce dense structural point clouds, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for robust vehicle localization.

Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end autonomous driving has attracted increasing attention for its ability to jointly model perception, prediction, and planning within a unified framework. However, most existing approaches underutilize the online mapping module, leaving its potential to enhance trajectory planning largely untapped. This paper proposes MAP (Map-Assisted Planning), a novel map-assisted end-to-end trajectory planning framework. MAP explicitly integrates segmentation-based map features and the current ego status through a Plan-enhancing Online Mapping module, an Ego-status-guided Planning module, and a Weight Adapter based on current ego status. Experiments conducted on the DAIR-V2X-seq-SPD dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 16.6% reduction in L2 displacement error, a 56.2% reduction in off-road rate, and a 44.5% improvement in overall score compared to the UniV2X baseline, even without post-processing. Furthermore, it achieves top ranking in Track 2 of the End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge of MEIS Workshop @CVPR2025, outperforming the second-best model by 39.5% in terms of overall score. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly leveraging semantic map features in planning and suggest new directions for improving structure design in end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

<title>MetricNet: Recovering Metric Scale in Generative Navigation Policies</title>

Abstract: Generative navigation policies have made rapid progress in improving end-to-end learned navigation. Despite their promising results, this paradigm has two structural problems. First, the sampled trajectories exist in an abstract, unscaled space without metric grounding. Second, the control strategy discards the full path, instead moving directly towards a single waypoint. This leads to short-sighted and unsafe actions, moving the robot towards obstacles that a complete and correctly scaled path would circumvent. To address these issues, we propose MetricNet, an effective add-on for generative navigation that predicts the metric distance between waypoints, grounding policy outputs in real-world coordinates. We evaluate our method in simulation with a new benchmarking framework and show that executing MetricNet-scaled waypoints significantly improves both navigation and exploration performance. Beyond simulation, we further validate our approach in real-world experiments. Finally, we propose MetricNav, which integrates MetricNet into a navigation policy to guide the robot away from obstacles while still moving towards the goal.

<title>MCGS-SLAM: A Multi-Camera SLAM Framework Using Gaussian Splatting for High-Fidelity Mapping</title>

Abstract: Recent progress in dense SLAM has primarily targeted monocular setups, often at the expense of robustness and geometric coverage. We present MCGS-SLAM, the first purely RGB-based multi-camera SLAM system built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike prior methods relying on sparse maps or inertial data, MCGS-SLAM fuses dense RGB inputs from multiple viewpoints into a unified, continuously optimized Gaussian map. A multi-camera bundle adjustment (MCBA) jointly refines poses and depths via dense photometric and geometric residuals, while a scale consistency module enforces metric alignment across views using low-rank priors. The system supports RGB input and maintains real-time performance at large scale. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that MCGS-SLAM consistently yields accurate trajectories and photorealistic reconstructions, usually outperforming monocular baselines. Notably, the wide field of view from multi-camera input enables reconstruction of side-view regions that monocular setups miss, critical for safe autonomous operation. These results highlight the promise of multi-camera Gaussian Splatting SLAM for high-fidelity mapping in robotics and autonomous driving.

Abstract: Most superpixel algorithms compute a trade-off between spatial and color features at the pixel level. Hence, they may need fine parameter tuning to balance the two measures, and highly fail to group pixels with similar local texture properties. In this paper, we address these issues with a new Texture-Aware SuperPixel (TASP) method. To accurately segment textured and smooth areas, TASP automatically adjusts its spatial constraint according to the local feature variance. Then, to ensure texture homogeneity within superpixels, a new pixel to superpixel patch-based distance is proposed. TASP outperforms the segmentation accuracy of the state-of-the-art methods on texture and also natural color image datasets.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a fast superpixel-based color transfer method (SCT) between two images. Superpixels enable to decrease the image dimension and to extract a reduced set of color candidates. We propose to use a fast approximate nearest neighbor matching algorithm in which we enforce the match diversity by limiting the selection of the same superpixels. A fusion framework is designed to transfer the matched colors, and we demonstrate the improvement obtained over exact matching results. Finally, we show that SCT is visually competitive compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Regular decompositions are necessary for most superpixel-based object recognition or tracking applications. So far in the literature, the regularity or compactness of a superpixel shape is mainly measured by its circularity. In this work, we first demonstrate that such measure is not adapted for superpixel evaluation, since it does not directly express regularity but circular appearance. Then, we propose a new metric that considers several shape regularity aspects: convexity, balanced repartition, and contour smoothness. Finally, we demonstrate that our measure is robust to scale and noise and enables to more relevantly compare superpixel methods.

Abstract: Superpixel decomposition methods are generally used as a pre-processing step to speed up image processing tasks. They group the pixels of an image into homogeneous regions while trying to respect existing contours. For all state-of-the-art superpixel decomposition methods, a trade-off is made between 1) computational time, 2) adherence to image contours and 3) regularity and compactness of the decomposition. In this paper, we propose a fast method to compute Superpixels with Contour Adherence using Linear Path (SCALP) in an iterative clustering framework. The distance computed when trying to associate a pixel to a superpixel during the clustering is enhanced by considering the linear path to the superpixel barycenter. The proposed framework produces regular and compact superpixels that adhere to the image contours. We provide a detailed evaluation of SCALP on the standard Berkeley Segmentation Dataset. The obtained results outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of standard superpixel and contour detection metrics.

Abstract: The challenging task of 3D planar reconstruction from images involves several sub-tasks including frame-wise plane detection, segmentation, parameter regression and possibly depth prediction, along with cross-frame plane correspondence and relative camera pose estimation. Previous works adopt a divide and conquer strategy, addressing above sub-tasks with distinct network modules in a two-stage paradigm. Specifically, given an initial camera pose and per-frame plane predictions from the first stage, further exclusively designed modules relying on external plane correspondence labeling are applied to merge multi-view plane entities and produce refined camera pose. Notably, existing work fails to integrate these closely related sub-tasks into a unified framework, and instead addresses them separately and sequentially, which we identify as a primary source of performance limitations. Motivated by this finding and the success of query-based learning in enriching reasoning among semantic entities, in this paper, we propose PlaneRecTR++, a Transformer-based architecture, which for the first time unifies all tasks of multi-view planar reconstruction and pose estimation within a compact single-stage framework, eliminating the need for the initial pose estimation and supervision of plane correspondence. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed unified learning achieves mutual benefits across sub-tasks, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance on the public ScanNetv1, ScanNetv2, NYUv2-Plane, and MatterPort3D datasets. Codes are available at https://github.com/SJingjia/PlaneRecTR-PP.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability of deep learning models in real-world applications. Existing methods typically focus on feature representations or output-space analysis, often assuming a distribution over these spaces or leveraging gradient norms with respect to model parameters. However, these approaches struggle to distinguish near-OOD samples and often require extensive hyper-parameter tuning, limiting their practicality.In this work, we propose GRadient-aware Out-Of-Distribution detection (GROOD), a method that derives an OOD prototype from synthetic samples and computes class prototypes directly from In-distribution (ID) training data. By analyzing the gradients of a nearest-class-prototype loss function concerning an artificial OOD prototype, our approach achieves a clear separation between in-distribution and OOD samples. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that gradients computed from the OOD prototype enhance the distinction between ID and OOD data, surpassing established baselines in robustness, particularly on ImageNet-1k. These findings highlight the potential of gradient-based methods and prototype-driven approaches in advancing OOD detection within deep neural networks.

<title>Leveraging Perceptual Scores for Dataset Pruning in Computer Vision Tasks</title>

Abstract: In this paper we propose a score of an image to use for coreset selection in image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. The score is the entropy of an image as approximated by the bits-per-pixel of its compressed version. Thus the score is intrinsic to an image and does not require supervision or training. It is very simple to compute and readily available as all images are stored in a compressed format. The motivation behind our choice of score is that most other scores proposed in literature are expensive to compute. More importantly, we want a score that captures the perceptual complexity of an image. Entropy is one such measure, images with clutter tend to have a higher entropy. However sampling only low entropy iconic images, for example, leads to biased learning and an overall decrease in test performance with current deep learning models. To mitigate the bias we use a graph based method that increases the spatial diversity of the selected samples. We show that this simple score yields good results, particularly for semantic segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Fashion image editing is a crucial tool for designers to convey their creative ideas by visualizing design concepts interactively. Current fashion image editing techniques, though advanced with multimodal prompts and powerful diffusion models, often struggle to accurately identify editing regions and preserve the desired garment texture detail. To address these challenges, we introduce a new multimodal fashion image editing architecture based on latent diffusion models, called Detail-Preserved Diffusion Models (DPDEdit). DPDEdit guides the fashion image generation of diffusion models by integrating text prompts, region masks, human pose images, and garment texture images. To precisely locate the editing region, we first introduce Grounded-SAM to predict the editing region based on the user's textual description, and then combine it with other conditions to perform local editing. To transfer the detail of the given garment texture into the target fashion image, we propose a texture injection and refinement mechanism. Specifically, this mechanism employs a decoupled cross-attention layer to integrate textual descriptions and texture images, and incorporates an auxiliary U-Net to preserve the high-frequency details of generated garment texture. Additionally, we extend the VITON-HD dataset using a multimodal large language model to generate paired samples with texture images and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our DPDEdit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of image fidelity and coherence with the given multimodal inputs.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed across applications. However, ensuring their reliability remains a challenge, and in many situations, alternative models with similar functionality and accuracy are available. Traditional accuracy-based evaluations often fail to capture behavioral differences between models, especially with limited test datasets, making it difficult to select or combine models effectively. Differential testing addresses this by generating test inputs that expose discrepancies in DNN model behavior. However, existing approaches face significant limitations: many rely on model internals or are constrained by available seed inputs. To address these challenges, we propose DiffGAN, a black-box test image generation approach for differential testing of DNN models. DiffGAN leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II to generate diverse and valid triggering inputs that reveal behavioral discrepancies between models. DiffGAN employs two custom fitness functions, focusing on diversity and divergence, to guide the exploration of the GAN input space and identify discrepancies between models' outputs. By strategically searching this space, DiffGAN generates inputs with specific features that trigger differences in model behavior. DiffGAN is black-box, making it applicable in more situations. We evaluate DiffGAN on eight DNN model pairs trained on widely used image datasets. Our results show DiffGAN significantly outperforms a SOTA baseline, generating four times more triggering inputs, with greater diversity and validity, within the same budget. Additionally, the generated inputs improve the accuracy of a machine learning-based model selection mechanism, which selects the best-performing model based on input characteristics and can serve as a smart output voting mechanism when using alternative models.

Abstract: Estimated brain age from magnetic resonance image (MRI) and its deviation from chronological age can provide early insights into potential neurodegenerative diseases, supporting early detection and implementation of prevention strategies. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) presents an opportunity to build an earlier biomarker for neurodegenerative disease prediction because it captures subtle microstructural changes that precede more perceptible macrostructural changes. However, the coexistence of macro- and micro-structural information in dMRI raises the question of whether current dMRI-based brain age estimation models are leveraging the intended microstructural information or if they inadvertently rely on the macrostructural information. To develop a microstructure-specific brain age, we propose a method for brain age identification from dMRI that mitigates the model's use of macrostructural information by non-rigidly registering all images to a standard template. Imaging data from 13,398 participants across 12 datasets were used for the training and evaluation. We compare our brain age models, trained with and without macrostructural information mitigated, with an architecturally similar T1-weighted (T1w) MRI-based brain age model and two recent, popular, openly available T1w MRI-based brain age models that primarily use macrostructural information. We observe difference between our dMRI-based brain age and T1w MRI-based brain age across stages of neurodegeneration, with dMRI-based brain age being older than T1w MRI-based brain age in participants transitioning from cognitively normal (CN) to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but younger in participants already diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, dMRI-based brain age may offer advantages over T1w MRI-based brain age in predicting the transition from CN to MCI up to five years before diagnosis.

Abstract: Stereo matching serves as a cornerstone in 3D vision, aiming to establish pixel-wise correspondences between stereo image pairs for depth recovery. Despite remarkable progress driven by deep neural architectures, current models often exhibit severe performance degradation when deployed in unseen domains, primarily due to the limited diversity of training data. In this work, we introduce StereoAnything, a data-centric framework that substantially enhances the zero-shot generalization capability of existing stereo models. Rather than devising yet another specialized architecture, we scale stereo training to an unprecedented level by systematically unifying heterogeneous stereo sources: (1) curated labeled datasets covering diverse environments, and (2) large-scale synthetic stereo pairs generated from unlabeled monocular images. Our mixed-data strategy delivers consistent and robust learning signals across domains, effectively mitigating dataset bias. Extensive zero-shot evaluations on four public benchmarks demonstrate that Stereo Anything achieves state-of-the-art generalization. This work paves the way towards truly universal stereo matching, offering a scalable data paradigm applicable to any stereo image pair. We extensively evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of our model on four public datasets, showcasing its impressive ability to generalize to any stereo image pair.

Abstract: Open-world 3D scene understanding is a critical challenge that involves recognizing and distinguishing diverse objects and categories from 3D data, such as point clouds, without relying on manual annotations. Traditional methods struggle with this open-world task, especially due to the limitations of constructing extensive point cloud-text pairs and handling multimodal data effectively. In response to these challenges, we present UniPLV, a robust framework that unifies point clouds, images, and text within a single learning paradigm for comprehensive 3D scene understanding. UniPLV leverages images as a bridge to co-embed 3D points with pre-aligned images and text in a shared feature space, eliminating the need for labor-intensive point cloud-text pair crafting. Our framework achieves precise multimodal alignment through two innovative strategies: (i) Logit and feature distillation modules between images and point clouds to enhance feature coherence; (ii) A vision-point matching module that implicitly corrects 3D semantic predictions affected by projection inaccuracies from points to pixels. To further boost performance, we implement four task-specific losses alongside a two-stage training strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniPLV significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, with average improvements of 15.6% and 14.8% in semantic segmentation for Base-Annotated and Annotation-Free tasks, respectively. These results underscore UniPLV's efficacy in pushing the boundaries of open-world 3D scene understanding. We will release the code to support future research and development.

Abstract: Improper solid waste management represents both a serious threat to ecosystem health and a significant source of revenues for criminal organizations perpetrating environmental crimes. This issue can be mitigated thanks to the increasing availability of Very-High-Resolution Remote Sensing (VHR RS) images. Modern image-analysis tools support automated photo-interpretation and large territory scanning in search of illegal waste disposal sites. This paper illustrates a semi-automatic waste detection pipeline, developed in collaboration with a regional environmental protection agency, for detecting candidate illegal dumping sites in VHR RS images. To optimize the effectiveness of the waste detector at the core of the pipeline, extensive experiments evaluate such design choices as the network architecture, the ground resolution and geographic span of the input images, as well as the pretraining procedures. The best model attains remarkable performance, achieving 92.02 % F1-Score and 94.56 % Accuracy. A generalization study assesses the performance variation when the detector processes images from various territories substantially different from the one used during training, incurring only a moderate performance loss, namely an average 5.1 % decrease in the F1-Score. Finally, an exercise in which expert photo-interpreters compare the effort required to scan large territories with and without support from the waste detector assesses the practical benefit of introducing a computer-aided image analysis tool in a professional environmental protection agency. Results show that a reduction of up to 30 % of the time spent for waste site detection can be attained.

Abstract: Existing methods for vision-language task planning excel in short-horizon tasks but often fall short in complex, long-horizon planning within dynamic environments. These challenges primarily arise from the difficulty of effectively training models to produce high-quality reasoning processes for long-horizon tasks. To address this, we propose Structured Preference Optimization (SPO), which aims to enhance reasoning and action selection in long-horizon task planning through structured preference evaluation and optimized training strategies. Specifically, SPO introduces: 1) Preference-Based Scoring and Optimization, which systematically evaluates reasoning chains based on task relevance, visual grounding, and historical consistency; and 2) Curriculum-Guided Training, where the model progressively adapts from simple to complex tasks, improving its generalization ability in long-horizon scenarios and enhancing reasoning robustness. To advance research in vision-language long-horizon task planning, we introduce ExtendaBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering 1,509 tasks across VirtualHome and Habitat 2.0, categorized into ultra-short, short, medium, and long tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SPO significantly improves reasoning quality and final decision accuracy, outperforming prior methods on long-horizon tasks and underscoring the effectiveness of preference-driven optimization in vision-language task planning. Specifically, SPO achieves a +5.98% GCR and +4.68% SR improvement in VirtualHome and a +3.30% GCR and +2.11% SR improvement in Habitat over the best-performing baselines.

Abstract: We introduce an image upscaling technique tailored for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) on lightweight GPUs. Compared to 3DGS, it achieves significantly higher rendering speeds and reduces artifacts commonly observed in 3DGS reconstructions. Our technique upscales low-resolution 3DGS renderings with a marginal increase in cost by directly leveraging the analytical image gradients of Gaussians for gradient-based bicubic spline interpolation. The technique is agnostic to the specific 3DGS implementation, achieving novel view synthesis at rates 3x-4x higher than the baseline implementation. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we showcase the performance improvements and high reconstruction fidelity attainable with gradient-aware upscaling of 3DGS images. We further demonstrate the integration of gradient-aware upscaling into the gradient-based optimization of a 3DGS model and analyze its effects on reconstruction quality and performance.

Abstract: We present a self-supervised method to improve an agent's abilities in describing arbitrary objects while actively exploring a generic environment. This is a challenging problem, as current models struggle to obtain coherent image captions due to different camera viewpoints and clutter. We propose a three-phase framework to fine-tune existing captioning models that enhances caption accuracy and consistency across views via a consensus mechanism. First, an agent explores the environment, collecting noisy image-caption pairs. Then, a consistent pseudo-caption for each object instance is distilled via consensus using a large language model. Finally, these pseudo-captions are used to fine-tune an off-the-shelf captioning model, with the addition of contrastive learning. We analyse the performance of the combination of captioning models, exploration policies, pseudo-labeling methods, and fine-tuning strategies, on our manually labeled test set. Results show that a policy can be trained to mine samples with higher disagreement compared to classical baselines. Our pseudo-captioning method, in combination with all policies, has a higher semantic similarity compared to other existing methods, and fine-tuning improves caption accuracy and consistency by a significant margin.

Abstract: We present a new self-supervised deep-learning-based Ghost Imaging (GI) reconstruction method, which provides unparalleled reconstruction performance for noisy acquisitions among unsupervised methods. We present the supporting mathematical framework and results from theoretical and real data use cases. Self-supervision removes the need for clean reference data while offering strong noise reduction. This provides the necessary tools for addressing signal-to-noise ratio concerns for GI acquisitions in emerging and cutting-edge low-light GI scenarios. Notable examples include micro- and nano-scale x-ray emission imaging, e.g., x-ray fluorescence imaging of dose-sensitive samples. Their applications include in-vivo and in-operando case studies for biological samples and batteries.

Abstract: Cattle lameness is a prevalent health problem in livestock farming, often resulting from hoof injuries or infections, and severely impacts animal welfare and productivity. Early and accurate detection is critical for minimizing economic losses and ensuring proper treatment. This study proposes a spatiotemporal deep learning framework for automated cattle lameness detection using publicly available video data. We curate and publicly release a balanced set of 50 online video clips featuring 42 individual cattle, recorded from multiple viewpoints in both indoor and outdoor environments. The videos were categorized into lame and non-lame classes based on visual gait characteristics and metadata descriptions. After applying data augmentation techniques to enhance generalization, two deep learning architectures were trained and evaluated: 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNN) and Convolutional Long-Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM2D). The 3D CNN achieved a video-level classification accuracy of 90%, with a precision, recall, and F1 score of 90.9% each, outperforming the ConvLSTM2D model, which achieved 85% accuracy. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on multistage pipelines involving object detection and pose estimation, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a direct end-to-end video classification approach. Compared with the best end-to-end prior method (C3D-ConvLSTM, 90.3%), our model achieves comparable accuracy while eliminating pose estimation pre-processing.The results indicate that deep learning models can successfully extract and learn spatio-temporal features from various video sources, enabling scalable and efficient cattle lameness detection in real-world farm settings.

Abstract: Current VLM-based VQA methods often process entire images, leading to excessive visual tokens that include redundant information irrelevant to the posed question. This abundance of unnecessary image details creates numerous visual tokens, drastically increasing memory and computational requirements in VLMs. To address this, we propose Contextual Region-Oriented Visual Token Pruning (CROP), a novel framework to compress visual tokens through a two-step process: Localization and Pruning. Specifically, CROP first employs an efficient model to identify the contextual region relevant to the input query. Subsequently, two distinct strategies are introduced for pruning: (1) Pre-LLM Compression (PLC), which adaptively compresses different image regions with varying ratios, and (2) Inner-LLM Pruning (ILP), a training-free method that prunes tokens within early LLM layers guided by the identified contextual region. Extensive experiments on a wide range of VQA tasks demonstrate that CROP significantly outperforms existing visual token pruning methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<title>Identity-Preserving Text-to-Video Generation Guided by Simple yet Effective Spatial-Temporal Decoupled Representations</title>

Abstract: Identity-preserving text-to-video (IPT2V) generation, which aims to create high-fidelity videos with consistent human identity, has become crucial for downstream applications. However, current end-to-end frameworks suffer a critical spatial-temporal trade-off: optimizing for spatially coherent layouts of key elements (e.g., character identity preservation) often compromises instruction-compliant temporal smoothness, while prioritizing dynamic realism risks disrupting the spatial coherence of visual structures. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet effective spatial-temporal decoupled framework that decomposes representations into spatial features for layouts and temporal features for motion dynamics. Specifically, our paper proposes a semantic prompt optimization mechanism and stage-wise decoupled generation paradigm. The former module decouples the prompt into spatial and temporal components. Aligned with the subsequent stage-wise decoupled approach, the spatial prompts guide the text-to-image (T2I) stage to generate coherent spatial features, while the temporal prompts direct the sequential image-to-video (I2V) stage to ensure motion consistency. Experimental results validate that our approach achieves excellent spatiotemporal consistency, demonstrating outstanding performance in identity preservation, text relevance, and video quality. By leveraging this simple yet robust mechanism, our algorithm secures the runner-up position in 2025 ACM MultiMedia Challenge.

<title>Effort-Optimized, Accuracy-Driven Labelling and Validation of Test Inputs for DL Systems: A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Approach</title>

Abstract: Software systems increasingly include AI components based on deep learning (DL). Reliable testing of such systems requires near-perfect test-input validity and label accuracy, with minimal human effort. Yet, the DL community has largely overlooked the need to build highly accurate datasets with minimal effort, since DL training is generally tolerant of labelling errors. This challenge, instead, reflects concerns more familiar to software engineering, where a central goal is to construct high-accuracy test inputs, with accuracy as close to 100% as possible, while keeping associated costs in check. In this article we introduce OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified accuracy target. To evaluate OPAL we instantiate it for two tasks in the context of testing vision systems: automatic labelling of test inputs and automated validation of test inputs. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL, relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, while cutting manual labelling by more than half. OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, when all methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA test-input validation baselines. Finally, we show that augmenting OPAL with an active-learning loop leads to an additional 4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to remarkable success across a wide range of tasks. However, their susceptibility to adversarial perturbations remains a critical vulnerability. Existing diffusion-based adversarial purification methods often require intensive iterative denoising, severely limiting their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose Diffusion Bridge Distillation for Purification (DBLP), a novel and efficient diffusion-based framework for adversarial purification. Central to our approach is a new objective, noise bridge distillation, which constructs a principled alignment between the adversarial noise distribution and the clean data distribution within a latent consistency model (LCM). To further enhance semantic fidelity, we introduce adaptive semantic enhancement, which fuses multi-scale pyramid edge maps as conditioning input to guide the purification process. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DBLP achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust accuracy, superior image quality, and around 0.2s inference time, marking a significant step toward real-time adversarial purification.

<title>Uni-cot: Towards Unified Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Across Text and Vision</title>

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories caused by fragmented architectures.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in few-step video generation.

Abstract: Drones operating in complex environments face a significant threat from thin obstacles, such as steel wires and kite strings at the submillimeter level, which are notoriously difficult for conventional sensors like RGB cameras, LiDAR, and depth cameras to detect. This paper introduces SkyShield, an event-driven, end-to-end framework designed for the perception of submillimeter scale obstacles. Drawing upon the unique features that thin obstacles present in the event stream, our method employs a lightweight U-Net architecture and an innovative Dice-Contour Regularization Loss to ensure precise detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our event-based approach achieves mean F1 Score of 0.7088 with a low latency of 21.2 ms, making it ideal for deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

Abstract: Crack detection plays a crucial role in civil infrastructures, including inspection of pavements, buildings, etc., and deep learning has significantly advanced this field in recent years. While numerous technical and review papers exist in this domain, emerging trends are reshaping the landscape. These shifts include transitions in learning paradigms (from fully supervised learning to semi-supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, few-shot, domain adaptation and fine-tuning foundation models), improvements in generalizability (from single-dataset performance to cross-dataset evaluation), and diversification in dataset acquisition (from RGB images to specialized sensor-based data). In this review, we systematically analyze these trends and highlight representative works. Additionally, we introduce a new annotated dataset collected with 3D laser scans, 3DCrack, to support future research and conduct extensive benchmarking experiments to establish baselines for commonly used deep learning methodologies, including recent foundation models. Our findings provide insights into the evolving methodologies and future directions in deep learning-based crack detection. Project page: https://github.com/nantonzhang/Awesome-Crack-Detection

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have shown impressive zero-shot and few-shot learning capabilities across diverse applications. However, adapting these models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on prompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing adaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and adapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model, and compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we present CLIP-SVD, a novel multi-modal and parameter-efficient adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without injecting additional modules. Specifically, we fine-tune only the singular values of the CLIP parameter matrices to rescale the basis vectors for domain adaptation while retaining the pretrained model. This design enables enhanced adaptation performance using only 0.04% of the model's total parameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD achieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10 biomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and generalization under few-shot settings. Additionally, we leverage a natural language-based approach to analyze the effectiveness and dynamics of the CLIP adaptation to allow interpretability of CLIP-SVD. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/HealthX-Lab/CLIP-SVD.

Abstract: Natural language is often the easiest and most convenient modality for humans to specify tasks for robots. However, learning to ground language to behavior typically requires impractical amounts of diverse, language-annotated demonstrations collected on each target robot. In this work, we aim to separate the problem of what to accomplish from how to accomplish it, as the former can benefit from substantial amounts of external observation-only data, and only the latter depends on a specific robot embodiment. To this end, we propose Video-Language Critic, a reward model that can be trained on readily available cross-embodiment data using contrastive learning and a temporal ranking objective, and use it to score behavior traces from a separate actor. When trained on Open X-Embodiment data, our reward model enables 2x more sample-efficient policy training on Meta-World tasks than a sparse reward only, despite a significant domain gap. Using in-domain data but in a challenging task generalization setting on Meta-World, we further demonstrate more sample-efficient training than is possible with prior language-conditioned reward models that are either trained with binary classification, use static images, or do not leverage the temporal information present in video data.

Abstract: Foley sound synthesis is crucial for multimedia production, enhancing user experience by synchronizing audio and video both temporally and semantically. Recent studies on automating this labor-intensive process through video-to-sound generation face significant challenges. Systems lacking explicit temporal features suffer from poor alignment and controllability, while timestamp-based models require costly and subjective human annotation. We propose Video-Foley, a video-to-sound system using Root Mean Square (RMS) as an intuitive condition with semantic timbre prompts (audio or text). RMS, a frame-level intensity envelope closely related to audio semantics, acts as a temporal event feature to guide audio generation from video. The annotation-free self-supervised learning framework consists of two stages, Video2RMS and RMS2Sound, incorporating novel ideas including RMS discretization and RMS-ControlNet with a pretrained text-to-audio model. Our extensive evaluation shows that Video-Foley achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio-visual alignment and controllability for sound timing, intensity, timbre, and nuance. Source code, model weights and demos are available on our companion website. (https://jnwnlee.github.io/video-foley-demo)

Abstract: Naturalistic scenes are of key interest for visual perception, but controlling their perceptual and semantic properties is challenging. Previous work on naturalistic scenes has frequently focused on collections of discrete images with considerable physical differences between stimuli. However, it is often desirable to assess representations of naturalistic images that vary along a continuum. Traditionally, perceptually continuous variations of naturalistic stimuli have been obtained by morphing a source image into a target image. This produces transitions driven mainly by low-level physical features and can result in semantically ambiguous outcomes. More recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been used to generate continuous perceptual variations within a stimulus category. Here we extend and generalize this approach using a different machine learning approach, a text-to-image diffusion model (Stable Diffusion XL), to generate a freely customizable stimulus set of photorealistic images that are characterized by gradual transitions, with each image representing a unique exemplar within a prompted category. We demonstrate the approach by generating a set of 108 object scenes from 6 categories. For each object scene, we generate 10 variants that are ordered along a perceptual continuum. This ordering was first estimated using a machine learning model of perceptual similarity (LPIPS) and then subsequently validated with a large online sample of human participants. In a subsequent experiment we show that this ordering is also predictive of confusability of stimuli in a working memory experiment. Our image set is suited for studies investigating the graded encoding of naturalistic stimuli in visual perception, attention, and memory.

Abstract: Early diagnosis and noninvasive monitoring of neurological disorders require sensitivity to elusive cellular-level alterations that occur much earlier than volumetric changes observable with the millimeter-resolution of medical imaging modalities. Morphological changes in axons, such as axonal varicosities or beadings, are observed in neurological disorders, as well as in development and aging. Here, we reveal the sensitivity of time-dependent diffusion MRI (dMRI) to the structurally disordered axonal morphology at the micrometer scale. Scattering theory uncovers the two parameters that determine the diffusive dynamics of water along axons: the average reciprocal cross-section and the variance of long-range cross-sectional fluctuations. This theoretical development allows us to predict dMRI metrics sensitive to axonal alterations over tens of thousands of axons in seconds rather than months of simulations in a rat model of traumatic brain injury, and is corroborated with ex vivo dMRI. Our approach bridges the gap between micrometers and millimeters in resolution, offering quantitative and objective biomarkers applicable to a broad spectrum of neurological disorders.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve high predictive performance but lack intrinsic interpretability, hindering our understanding of the learned prediction behavior. Existing local explainability methods focus on associations, neglecting the causal drivers of model predictions. Other approaches adopt a causal perspective but primarily provide global, model-level explanations. However, for specific inputs, it's unclear whether globally identified factors apply locally. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework for local interventional explanations by leveraging recent advances in image-to-image editing models. Our approach performs gradual interventions on semantic properties to quantify the corresponding impact on a model's predictions using a novel score, the expected property gradient magnitude. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through an extensive empirical evaluation on a wide range of architectures and tasks. First, we validate it in a synthetic scenario and demonstrate its ability to locally identify biases. Afterward, we apply our approach to investigate medical skin lesion classifiers, analyze network training dynamics, and study a pre-trained CLIP model with real-life interventional data. Our results highlight the potential of interventional explanations on the property level to reveal new insights into the behavior of deep models.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) offer universal function approximation using univariate spline compositions without nonlinear activations. In this work, we integrate Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) into the KAN framework to transform multi-class classification into multiple binary tasks, improving robustness via Hamming distance decoding. Our proposed KAN with ECOC framework outperforms vanilla KAN on a challenging blood cell classification dataset, achieving higher accuracy across diverse hyperparameter settings. Ablation studies further confirm that ECOC consistently enhances performance across FastKAN and FasterKAN variants. These results demonstrate that ECOC integration significantly boosts KAN generalizability in critical healthcare AI applications.

Abstract: Rebus puzzles, visual riddles that encode language through imagery, spatial arrangement, and symbolic substitution, pose a unique challenge to current vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional image captioning or question answering tasks, rebus solving requires multi-modal abstraction, symbolic reasoning, and a grasp of cultural, phonetic and linguistic puns. In this paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic substitutions to spatially-dependent cues ("head" over "heels"). We analyze how different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and understanding visual metaphors.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently gained attention due to their effectiveness to understand and generate descriptions of visual content. Most existing LMMs are in English language. While few recent works explore multilingual image LMMs, to the best of our knowledge, moving beyond the English language for cultural and linguistic inclusivity is yet to be investigated in the context of video LMMs. In pursuit of more inclusive video LMMs, we introduce a multilingual Video LMM benchmark, named ViMUL-Bench, to evaluate Video LMMs across 14 languages, including both low- and high-resource languages: English, Chinese, Spanish, French, German, Hindi, Arabic, Russian, Bengali, Urdu, Sinhala, Tamil, Swedish, and Japanese. Our ViMUL-Bench is designed to rigorously test video LMMs across 15 categories including eight culturally diverse categories, ranging from lifestyles and festivals to foods and rituals and from local landmarks to prominent cultural personalities. ViMUL-Bench comprises both open-ended (short and long-form) and multiple-choice questions spanning various video durations (short, medium, and long) with 8k samples that are manually verified by native language speakers. In addition, we also introduce a machine translated multilingual video training set comprising 1.2 million samples and develop a simple multilingual video LMM, named ViMUL, that is shown to provide a better tradeoff between high-and low-resource languages for video understanding. We hope our ViMUL-Bench and multilingual video LMM along with a large-scale multilingual video training set will help ease future research in developing cultural and linguistic inclusive multilingual video LMMs. Our proposed benchmark, video LMM and training data will be publicly released at https://mbzuai-oryx.github.io/ViMUL/.

Abstract: Colorectal polyp segmentation is critical for early detection of colorectal cancer, yet weak and low contrast boundaries significantly limit automated accuracy. Existing deep models either blur fine edge details or rely on handcrafted filters that perform poorly under variable imaging conditions. We propose MEGANet-W, a Wavelet Driven Edge Guided Attention Network that injects directional, parameter free Haar wavelet edge maps into each decoder stage to recalibrate semantic features. The key novelties of MEGANet-W include a two-level Haar wavelet head for multi-orientation edge extraction; and Wavelet Edge Guided Attention (W-EGA) modules that fuse wavelet cues with boundary and input branches. On five public polyp datasets, MEGANet-W consistently outperforms existing methods, improving mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, while introducing no additional learnable parameters. This approach improves reliability in difficult cases and offers a robust solution for medical image segmentation tasks requiring precise boundary detection.

Abstract: Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the inefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model (GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling potential of 3D world model.

Abstract: Automated defect detection from UAV imagery of transmission lines is a challenging task due to the small size, ambiguity, and complex backgrounds of defects. This paper proposes TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed to achieve accurate and efficient detection of transmission line defects from UAV-acquired images. The model integrates four major components: an edge-enhanced ResNet backbone to strengthen boundary-sensitive representations, a stride-free space-to-depth module to enable detail-preserving downsampling, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale attention mechanism to jointly model global context and local cues, and a Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve the localization of small and difficult targets. Together, these designs effectively mitigate the limitations of conventional detectors. Extensive experiments on both public and real-world datasets demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR achieves superior detection performance and strong generalization capability, while maintaining modest computational overhead. The accuracy and efficiency of TinyDef-DETR make it a suitable method for UAV-based transmission line defect detection, particularly in scenarios involving small and ambiguous targets.

Summary: BranchGRPO introduces a novel method for improving human preference alignment in image and video generative models. It addresses the inefficiency of existing variants by restructuring the rollout process into a branching tree, where shared prefixes amortize computation and pruning removes low-value paths. The method includes a branching scheme for cost amortization, a reward fusion and advantage estimator for transforming sparse rewards into dense signals, and pruning strategies for efficient gradient computation. BranchGRPO outperforms DanceGRPO in image alignment scores by up to 16% while reducing training time by 55%. The hybrid variant, BranchGRPO-Mix, achieves even faster training without compromising alignment quality. On video generation tasks, BranchGRPO produces sharper and temporally consistent frames compared to DanceGRPO. This method shows promising results for improving alignment in generative models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.06040v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in aligning image and video generative models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has improved human preference alignment, but existing variants remain inefficient due to sequential rollouts and large numbers of sampling steps, unreliable credit assignment: sparse terminal rewards are uniformly propagated across timesteps, failing to capture the varying criticality of decisions during denoising. In this paper, we present BranchGRPO, a method that restructures the rollout process into a branching tree, where shared prefixes amortize computation and pruning removes low-value paths and redundant depths. BranchGRPO introduces three contributions: (1) a branching scheme that amortizes rollout cost through shared prefixes while preserving exploration diversity; (2) a reward fusion and depth-wise advantage estimator that transforms sparse terminal rewards into dense step-level signals; and (3) pruning strategies that cut gradient computation but leave forward rollouts and exploration unaffected. On HPDv2.1 image alignment, BranchGRPO improves alignment scores by up to \textbf{16\%} over DanceGRPO, while reducing per-iteration training time by nearly \textbf{55\%}. A hybrid variant, BranchGRPO-Mix, further accelerates training to 4.7x faster than DanceGRPO without degrading alignment. On WanX video generation, it further achieves higher Video-Align scores with sharper and temporally consistent frames compared to DanceGRPO.

Abstract: Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January 2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios. Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97 ($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and 0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate 3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features. Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation, and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering informed patient choices across medical applications.

<div> Keywords: TRISO fuel, convolutional neural networks, image segmentation, irradiated particles, machine learning

Summary: 
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were utilized to automatically segment cross-sectional images of irradiated TRISO fuel particles. With a dataset of over 2,000 microscopic images, including annotated data, four different CNN architectures were tested – RU-Net, U-Net, ResNet, and Attention U-Net. The RU-Net model demonstrated the highest performance based on Intersection over Union (IoU). This automated segmentation approach using CNNs allows for expedited analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, minimizing manual labor and enhancing objectivity in results. The study aims to address the challenges of identifying irradiation-induced morphological changes in TRISO fuel, such as kernel swelling and buffer densification, by leveraging machine learning techniques for efficient data analysis in the field of nuclear fuel research.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.12244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO) particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the segmentation results.

Summary:
This study proposes a tiered pipeline for efficient nutrient management in agriculture, addressing the need for real-time optimization and sustainable resource consumption. It utilizes multispectral imaging (MSI) and machine learning techniques for anomaly detection and status estimation of crop nutrients. The pipeline includes an autoencoder for early warning of anomalies and two status estimation modules – vegetation index (VI) features with Random Forest (RF) and raw whole-image deep learning with Vision Transformer (ViT). Results showed high-efficiency anomaly detection and detailed nutrient status estimation, with ViT outperforming RF in certain nutrient estimations. The study highlights the trade-offs between complexity and energy cost in status estimation modules, offering practical opportunities for agricultural sustainability and edge diagnostics. <div>

Abstract: Efficient nutrient management is critical for crop growth and sustainable resource consumption (e.g., nitrogen, energy). Current approaches require lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass, and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis: vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural sustainability.

Abstract: Understanding humor is a core aspect of social intelligence, yet it remains a significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We introduce PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative sequences. Experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial gaps: for instance, top models achieve only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models' integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor understanding. By providing a rigorous framework for evaluating multimodal contextual and narrative reasoning, PixelHumor aims to drive the development of LMMs that better engage in natural, socially aware interactions.

The study focuses on Human-Object Interaction (HOI) perception and generation and highlights the limitations of current offline methods in handling online scenarios where information is limited to the current moment and historical data. To tackle this challenge, the researchers propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception.

This framework effectively integrates historical information and streaming data, yielding state-of-the-art results on online generation tasks such as Core4D and OAKINK2, as well as the online HOI4D perception task. By addressing the need for real-time processing of HOI tasks, the study demonstrates the importance of adapting existing methods to online settings for improved performance in fields like robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding.

Abstract: The perception and generation of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) are crucial for fields such as robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding. However, current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast, in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as well as the online HOI4D perception task.

Summary:<br />
Deep learning technology has made significant advancements in various domains, including computer vision, leading to the emergence of deepfake technology. While deepfake technology has the potential to revolutionize social interactions, it also poses several risks to society. Misuse of deepfake technology, such as face-swapping programs, can deceive individuals and manipulate public perception, affecting privacy and reputation. Additionally, the creation of counterfeit images and videos can threaten national security by compromising the functionality of facial recognition systems. As a result, the improper application of deepfake technology can have detrimental effects on political and economic structures, with the potential to influence election campaigns and undermine the credibility of prominent figures. Thus, careful consideration and regulation of deepfake technology are necessary to mitigate its negative impacts on human society. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Currently, deep learning has been utilised to tackle several difficulties in our everyday lives. It not only exhibits progress in computer vision but also constitutes the foundation for several revolutionary technologies. Nonetheless, similar to all phenomena, the use of deep learning in diverse domains has produced a multifaceted interaction of advantages and disadvantages for human society. Deepfake technology has advanced, significantly impacting social life. However, developments in this technology can affect privacy, the reputations of prominent personalities, and national security via software development. It can produce indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, potentially impairing the functionality of facial recognition systems, so presenting a significant risk.
  The improper application of deepfake technology produces several detrimental effects on society. Face-swapping programs mislead users by altering persons' appearances or expressions to fulfil particular aims or to appropriate personal information. Deepfake technology permeates daily life through such techniques. Certain individuals endeavour to sabotage election campaigns or subvert prominent political figures by creating deceptive pictures to influence public perception, causing significant harm to a nation's political and economic structure.

Summary:
In this study, the relationship between the Simplicity Bias (SB) in CLIP models and their performance in various image classification tasks is explored. The researchers first analyze the limitations of existing complexity measures and propose a more refined frequency-aware measure to capture SB differences in large models. By applying this new measure to CLIP models, they demonstrate its effectiveness in understanding SB variations. The study then investigates how the SB of models relates to their performance in different types of image classification tasks, including zero-shot and fine-tuning scenarios. The results show that a stronger SB in models can lead to better performance in out-of-distribution generalization but not necessarily in terms of adversarial robustness. This suggests that aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the target task is crucial for optimal performance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.12265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the SB to various image classification tasks.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this, we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the target task.

Summary:
GraphDerm is a framework that incorporates patient metadata, physical scale, and imaging data for dermoscopic classification, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The study utilizes ISIC 2018/2019 data, synthesizing ruler-embedded images and training U-Nets for lesion and ruler segmentation. Scale calibration is achieved through regression of pixels-per-millimeter using a 1D-CNN. Real-scale descriptors are computed from lesion masks, and node features are extracted using EfficientNet-B3. A spectral GNN is employed for semi-supervised node classification, outperforming an image-only ANN baseline. The results demonstrate high accuracy with AUC of 0.9812, and a sparser graph with 25% of edges preserves a high AUC of 0.9788. The study highlights the benefits of incorporating scale, geometry, and metadata in dermoscopic decision support systems, offering a promising direction for future AI research in dermatology. Future work will focus on refining edge semantics and evaluating on broader datasets.

Abstract: Introduction. Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019, synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets (SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN. From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline. Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440 for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99 range. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in a population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on ISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient deployment. Scale-aware, graph-based AI is a promising direction for dermoscopic decision support; future work will refine learned edge semantics and evaluate on broader curated benchmarks.

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks: regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the scalability and generalizability of our training data

<div> wake detection, synthetic aperture radar, domain adaptation, feature similarity filtering, memory guidance<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new approach, SimMemDA, for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The complex imaging mechanism of SAR images makes wake features challenging to annotate accurately. To address the domain shift issue between optical and SAR images, the SimMemDA framework incorporates WakeGAN for style transfer and utilizes instance-level feature similarity filtering to prioritize source samples with target-like distributions. A Feature-Confidence Memory Bank and a K-nearest neighbor confidence-weighted fusion strategy are introduced to improve the reliability of pseudo-labels in the target domain. Furthermore, region-mixed training is implemented by combining source annotations with calibrated target pseudo-labels to enhance generalization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the SimMemDA method in improving the accuracy of cross-modal ship wake detection tasks. <div>

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its all- weather and wide-area observation capabilities, serves as a crucial tool for wake detection. However, due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast, optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adap- tation (termed SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance. Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images, generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source samples with target-like dis- tributions, minimizing negative transfer. Meanwhile, a Feature- Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with calibrated tar- get pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.

<div> deep learning, air temperature, data-driven, spatiotemporal, weather stations 

Summary: 
The article introduces a data-driven, physics-guided deep learning method, called Amplifier Air-Transformer, to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution over the contiguous United States. The approach first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured by clouds using neural networks. It then transforms the reconstructed surface temperature into air temperature by leveraging its relationship with Earth surface properties. Predictive uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning is used to improve reliability. The approach achieves an accuracy of 1.93°C in station-based validation. The method streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction and can be extended to other satellite sources for high-resolution air temperature monitoring. The generated data is available for download and more information can be found on the project webpage. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability. The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction, and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution.

Summary: 
The DS@GT team participated in the AnimalCLEF 2025 re-identification challenge, focusing on the effectiveness of post-hoc metric learning. They compared a general-purpose model (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as backbone embeddings. Their findings showed that the quality and domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings significantly impact the effectiveness of metric learning. The specialized MegaDescriptor model benefited from a triplet-learning projection head, while the general-purpose DINOv2 model had minimal gains. The study revealed the challenges of reshaping general-purpose features for fine-grained tasks, highlighting the importance of domain-specific pre-training for limited-data re-ID tasks. The team's implementation is publicly available on GitHub at github.com/dsgt-arc/animalclef-2025.

Abstract: This paper details the DS@GT team's entry for the AnimalCLEF 2025 re-identification challenge. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of post-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose model (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known individuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head improved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13 points, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on averaged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is more difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant validation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the critical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized, limited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific pre-training. The implementation for this work is publicly available at github.com/dsgt-arc/animalclef-2025.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10 dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Summary: 
This study investigates the use of raw imagery from UAVs for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests. It compares the performance of detection in raw and orthomosaic imagery, examining within-domain and cross-domain transfer. The research also explores the impact of crown-center annotations on localization accuracy. The results show that raw imagery outperforms orthomosaics in deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics are valuable for cross-domain generalization. Additionally, incorporating crown-center annotations in training improves localization accuracy and provides precise tree positions for ecological analyses. This study offers practical guidance for using UAVs in biodiversity and conservation monitoring. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is essential for ecological monitoring and forest management. Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests. Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.

Summary: 
The paper introduces MechBench, a benchmark dataset comprising 693 synthetic gear assemblies with ground-truth motion trajectories. These assemblies simulate realistic mechanical structures where motion is generated through geometric coupling rather than predefined joints. The dataset serves as a platform to study coupled motion in mechanical assemblies. The authors propose DYNAMO, a neural model that predicts SE(3) motion trajectories of individual parts directly from segmented CAD point clouds. Experimental results demonstrate that DYNAMO performs better than existing methods, producing accurate and consistent predictions for diverse gear configurations. MechBench and DYNAMO combined create a systematic framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD assemblies. <div>
arXiv:2509.12430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the motion of articulated mechanical assemblies from static geometry remains a core challenge in 3D perception and design automation. Prior work on everyday articulated objects such as doors and laptops typically assumes simplified kinematic structures or relies on joint annotations. However, in mechanical assemblies like gears, motion arises from geometric coupling, through meshing teeth or aligned axes, making it difficult for existing methods to reason about relational motion from geometry alone. To address this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories. MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part dynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints. Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point clouds. Experiments show that DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear configurations. Together, MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD assemblies.

Summary:  <div>

Abstract: Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency, and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8% Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs, maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations. These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis.

This paper provides a meta review of deep learning approaches for tasks such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and modeling. The review includes a wide range of urban and environmental applications, highlighting gaps that need to be addressed for these methods to be effectively applied.

Abstract: Point cloud processing as a fundamental task in the field of geomatics and computer vision, has been supporting tasks and applications at different scales from air to ground, including mapping, environmental monitoring, urban/tree structure modeling, automated driving, robotics, disaster responses etc. Due to the rapid development of deep learning, point cloud processing algorithms have nowadays been almost explicitly dominated by learning-based approaches, most of which are yet transitioned into real-world practices. Existing surveys primarily focus on the ever-updating network architecture to accommodate unordered point clouds, largely ignoring their practical values in typical point cloud processing applications, in which extra-large volume of data, diverse scene contents, varying point density, data modality need to be considered. In this paper, we provide a meta review on deep learning approaches and datasets that cover a selection of critical tasks of point cloud processing in use such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and modeling. By reviewing a broad range of urban and environmental applications these tasks can support, we identify gaps to be closed as these methods transformed into applications and draw concluding remarks in both the algorithmic and practical aspects of the surveyed methods.

Abstract: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide. Glaucoma prognosis is essential for identifying at-risk patients and enabling timely intervention to prevent blindness. Many existing approaches rely on historical sequential data but are constrained by fixed-length inputs, limiting their flexibility. Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often employ end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling Framework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis. In the first stage, we employ a feature representation module that leverages self-supervised learning to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets for training, disregarding differences in their supervisory information. This approach enables datasets of varying sizes to learn better feature representations. In the second stage, we introduce a temporal aggregation module that incorporates an attention-based mechanism to process sequential inputs of varying lengths, ensuring flexible and efficient utilization of all available data. This design significantly enhances model performance while maintaining a compact parameter size. Extensive experiments on two benchmark glaucoma datasets:the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and the Glaucoma Real-world Appraisal Progression Ensemble (GRAPE),which differ significantly in scale and clinical settings,demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

Summary:
The paper discusses the limitations of current image generative models in capturing the distribution of images in a pre-constructed latent space. It proposes a novel tokenizer training scheme that includes main training and post-training to address the discrepancy between reconstruction and generation distribution. During main training, a latent perturbation strategy is introduced to simulate sampling noises and improve the robustness of the tokenizer. The paper also introduces a new evaluation metric, pFID, to assess the tokenizer's performance in relation to generation quality. Post-training optimizes the tokenizer decoder to mitigate the distribution difference between generated and reconstructed tokens. Through experiments, the proposed training scheme significantly enhances generation quality and convergence speed. The effectiveness of the post-training strategy is validated on various tokenizers and generators, demonstrating improved performance in generating high-quality images. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.12474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However, there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers, coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

<div> mmWave, radar, dataset, Generalizable Radar Transformer, data scaling
<br />
Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a large raw radar dataset comprising 1 million samples (29 hours) and presents a foundational model for 4D single-chip radar. The model, called Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT), can accurately predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation with high quality, even with the poor angular resolution characteristic of mmWave radars. The GRT demonstrates generalizability across various environments, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and exhibits logarithmic data scaling of 20% per 10x increase in data. The use of raw radar data significantly outperforms lossy representations, equivalent to a 10x increase in training data. The study suggests that approximately 100 million samples (3000 hours) of data are needed to fully leverage the capabilities of the GRT. <div>
arXiv:2509.12482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: mmWave radars are compact, inexpensive, and durable sensors that are robust to occlusions and work regardless of environmental conditions, such as weather and darkness. However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution, especially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in automotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed learning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational models or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners have largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small datasets.
  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar dataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D single-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation with quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution sensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT) generalizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and shows logarithmic data scaling of 20\% per $10\times$ data. We also run extensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar data significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to a $10\times$ increase in training data. Finally, we roughly estimate that $\approx$100M samples (3000 hours) of data are required to fully exploit the potential of GRT.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations, including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment. Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1) descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size, dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.

Summary: IG-CAM, a novel weakly supervised semantic segmentation approach, improves object boundary localization by utilizing instance-level cues and influence functions. It incorporates Instance-Guided Refinement for complete object coverage, Influence Function Integration for robust representations, and Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement for sharp boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset, with an mIoU of 82.3% pre and 86.6% post Conditional Random Field refinement. It outperforms existing methods in terms of localization accuracy, object coverage, and computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 images demonstrate robustness and generalization. IG-CAM sets a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic segmentation, offering a practical solution when pixel-level annotations are limited or costly. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses the challenge of training segmentation models using only image-level annotations, eliminating the need for expensive pixel-level labeling. While existing methods struggle with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most discriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that uses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete object coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model predictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3) Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies to achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before post-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional Random Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS methods. Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with complete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images showcase the method's robustness and generalization capability. The results establish IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from noisy or incomplete point clouds commonly captured by real-world sensors like LiDAR or RGB-D cameras. The traditional methods for creating artist-style meshes require clean and complete input data or involve complex multi-stage pipelines, limiting their practicality in real-world scenarios. The proposed approach directly refines the input point cloud to produce high-quality artist-style meshes.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from noisy or incomplete point clouds, such as those captured by real-world sensors like LiDAR or mobile RGB-D cameras. Artist-created meshes are crucial for commercial graphics pipelines due to their compatibility with animation and texturing tools and their efficiency in rendering. However, existing approaches often assume clean, complete inputs or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose an end-to-end method that refines the input point cloud and directly produces high-quality, artist-style meshes. At the core of our approach is a novel reformulation of 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting task, enabling the use of powerful generative models. Preliminary results on the ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the promise of our framework in producing clean, complete meshes.

Abstract: Accurate, high-throughput phenotyping is a critical component of modern crop breeding programs, especially for improving traits such as mechanical stability, biomass production, and disease resistance. Stalk diameter is a key structural trait, but traditional measurement methods are labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsuitable for scalable phenotyping. In this paper, we present a geometry-aware computer vision pipeline for estimating stalk diameter from RGB-D imagery. Our method integrates deep learning-based instance segmentation, 3D point cloud reconstruction, and axis-aligned slicing via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and agronomic research.

<div> NC-structure, Federated Learning, Multi-label, Neural Collapse, Feature Disentanglement <br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
Federated Learning (FL) faces challenges in deep learning when dealing with decentralized and heterogeneous data. This issue is exacerbated in multi-label scenarios, where label co-occurrence and inter-label dependency are common. The Neural Collapse (NC) theory describes a structure in the feature space that can be utilized to align feature distributions across clients in FL and improve representation learning. A feature disentanglement module is introduced to extract semantically specific features in multi-label settings, allowing for better clustering guided by a shared NC structure. Regularization losses further promote compact clustering. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in addressing the complexities of multi-label scenarios in FL. <div>

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships. While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging FL scenario.

Abstract: Face forgery detection faces a critical challenge: a persistent gap between offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media. To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents, equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the effectiveness and value of our framework.

<div> Keywords: Transformer-based methods, Human-Object Interaction detection, Graph Neural Networks, Multimodal Graph Network Modeling, HOI task

Summary: 
Multimodal Graph Network Modeling (MGNM) is proposed to enhance Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection by leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The Transformer architecture lacks explicit relational modeling, hindering interaction recognition. MGNM implements a four-stage graph structure framework for HOI tasks. It incorporates a multi-level feature interaction mechanism to improve information propagation across human-object pairs by leveraging vision and language features. MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks and exhibits a significant performance boost when integrated with advanced object detectors. It effectively balances performance between rare and non-rare classes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.12554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection, which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper, we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork \textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs. Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare classes.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Accurate lighting estimation in computer vision and graphics is challenging due to difficulties in restoring detailed textures of illumination maps and maintaining run-time efficiency. To address this, a new framework called VQT-Light is proposed based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. By leveraging these two modules for feature extraction and lighting estimation, VQT-Light extracts discrete features using VQVAE to prevent "posterior collapse" and captures global context and dependencies through ViT rather than CNNs. This approach enhances the prediction of illumination beyond the field of view and formulates lighting estimation as a multiclass classification task. The model achieves fast inference speed of 40FPS, improves multiple evaluation metrics, and produces light maps with richer textures and fidelity compared to existing methods, showcasing superior results in both qualitative and quantitative experiments. <div>

Abstract: Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in run-ning speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes two modules: feature extraction and lighting estima-tion. First, we take advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather than con-tinuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture global context and dependencies of in-put image through ViT rather than CNNs to improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and im-proves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Summary:
The paper introduces an adaptive sampling scheduler for consistency distillation methods in diffusion models. The scheduler incorporates dynamic target timestep selection based on timestep importance, optimized alternating sampling along the solution trajectory, and the use of smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques. These strategies enhance generative performance and stability, allowing for more effective exploration of the solution space and improved generation results in complex scenarios. Experimental evaluations across various consistency distillation methods validate the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive sampling scheduler, showcasing significant improvements in generative performance. The method demonstrates strong adaptability and broad applicability in enhancing the sampling potential of diffusion models for practical applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.12569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

Summary:
- The study introduces a novel adversarial attack framework named DisorientLiDAR that targets LiDAR-based localization in self-driving cars.
- Adversaries reverse-engineer localization models to strategically remove critical keypoints and disrupt LiDAR-based localization.
- The attack is evaluated on three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset, showing a significant degradation in registration accuracy when removing key regions.
- The impact of the attack on the Autoware autonomous driving platform is demonstrated, with even a few critical regions hidden leading to noticeable localization drift.
- The attack is extended to the physical world by concealing critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials, replicating the effects observed in KITTI data and showcasing a step closer to realistic physical-world attacks. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.12595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks), adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them, thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials, thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

Summary:
This paper addresses the challenge of removing reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective surfaces in image restoration. The proposed approach introduces the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum of reflection images, leveraging wavelength differences to distinguish reflections accurately. Spectral prior refinement modules are designed to enhance spectral differences in the reconstructed spectrum. The Spectrum-Aware Transformer is presented to recover transmitted content in both spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on multiple reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of the proposed method compared to existing models. <div>
arXiv:2509.12627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension. Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel approach called Cyclic Iterative Adversarial Robustness Distillation (CIARD) to address the performance degradation issue in existing Adversarial Robustness Distillation (ARD) methods. The key innovations of CIARD include a multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment to resolve conflicts in optimization objectives and continuous adversarial retraining to maintain robustness against performance deterioration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets show that CIARD outperforms existing methods, achieving a significant improvement in adversarial defense rates and clean sample accuracy. The proposed method establishes a new benchmark for balancing model robustness and generalization. The code for CIARD is publicly available for further research and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.12633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and 2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness and generalization.

Summary:
Detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data is a critical challenge in media forensics. Existing benchmarks suffer from misalignment artifacts, creating easily detectable anomalies that differ from real-world manipulation patterns. To address this gap, the Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM) dataset is introduced, featuring semantically-coordinated manipulations with paired textual descriptions. The Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and Grounding (RamDG) framework relies on external knowledge repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, enhancing detection accuracy. Through a two-stage pipeline, SAMM is generated by applying image manipulations and generating contextually-plausible narratives. RamDG outperforms existing methods, achieving higher detection accuracy on SAMM. The dataset and code are publicly available, facilitating further research in detecting and grounding semantically-consistent manipulations.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

While existing benchmarks demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM) dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/shen8424/SAMM-RamDG-CAP.

<div> Keywords: cross-view geo-localization, EVA02, Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion, MFB block, FSA module <br />
Summary: <br />
Cross-view geo-localization is a challenging task due to appearance variations and difficulty in feature extraction. The proposed MFAF method utilizes Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Blocks (MFB) to capture both low and high-frequency features, enhancing feature consistency. Additionally, the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module focuses on key regions of frequency features to reduce interference from background noise. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the MFAF method achieves competitive performance in drone localization and navigation tasks. <div>

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion (MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block (MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone navigation tasks.

<div> Keywords: underwater imagery, autonomous underwater vehicles, computer vision, YOLO, marine-vision research 

Summary: 
This study evaluates the performance of recent YOLO variants on underwater imagery for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Two datasets, Coral Disease and Fish Species, were curated, and YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s were trained and compared using identical hyperparameters. The results show that accuracy plateaus after YOLOv9, indicating that architectural innovations primarily focus on efficiency rather than accuracy. However, inference speed improves significantly. It was found that YOLOv10 offers the best speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment. Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations were used to analyze feature utilization and localization faithfulness. This study provides a controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants on underwater imagery, showcasing the potential of lightweight YOLOv10 for marine-vision research. To accelerate future research in this field, an open, reproducible benchmark and codebase have been made available. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.12682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20 classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly. Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision research.

Abstract: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The curated dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive experiments by benchmarking a variety of desmoking methods on our dataset. Our dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical image desmoking in real-world fire scenes. This dataset has been released to the public and can be downloaded from https://github.com/ncfjd/SmokeBench.

The study introduces RIS-FUSION, a novel framework that combines referring image segmentation (RIS) and text-driven image fusion to enhance semantic alignment. The LangGatedFusion module is at the core of this system, injecting textual features into the fusion backbone for improved performance. A new benchmark called MM-RIS is also introduced, offering a significant amount of training and testing data for multimodal referring image segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective: highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/SijuMa2003/RIS-FUSION.

Summary:
Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) introduces a novel approach to Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) by leveraging neuroscientific findings on imagination and perception. The method addresses challenges posed by the entangled nature of attributes and objects, as well as long-tailed distributions in real-world data.

This approach demonstrates the effectiveness of leveraging cognitive processes to improve CZSL performance and highlights the importance of incorporating prior knowledge for compositional generalization.

<br /><br />Summary: Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) enhances Compositional Zero-Shot Learning by leveraging neuroscientific insights and prior knowledge to address challenges in feature augmentation and generalization.

arXiv:2509.12711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives, \textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and \textit{open-world} settings.

Summary:
AsyMoE is introduced as a novel architecture for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to address the challenges faced by existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches due to the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. The proposed model includes three specialized expert groups: intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and evidence-priority language experts to maintain contextual grounding. By systematically analyzing the behavior of language experts in deeper layers, AsyMoE overcomes the reliance on parametric knowledge and effectively utilizes visual and linguistic information. Extensive experiments show that AsyMoE outperforms vanilla MoE and modality-specific MoE with significant accuracy improvements while requiring fewer activated parameters than dense models. <div>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training. However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups. We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves 26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

Summary:
This article introduces new dynamic spatial benchmarks that focus on long-horizon reasoning and memory utilization in partially observable and changing environments. The benchmarks, locally observable maze navigation and match-2 elimination, assess models' abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning in dynamic settings. The challenges include local perception, environment feedback, and global objectives that interact with each action taken, necessitating continuous cognitive updates. A subjective experience-based memory mechanism is proposed for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments demonstrate the limitations of current models in dynamic spatial reasoning and long-term memory.

Abstract: Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models' abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception, environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for future methodological advances.

<div> Keywords: single-view 3D generative models, multiview diffusion priors, Spherical Projection (SP) representation, consistency, efficiency

Summary: 
SPGen is a new single-view 3D generative model that uses a Spherical Projection (SP) representation to encode geometry information on a bounding sphere. This approach eliminates view inconsistency, supports nested internal structures, and allows for efficient computation. SPGen outperforms existing models in geometric quality and computational efficiency. The injective SP mapping ensures consistency by encoding surface geometry with a single viewpoint, eliminating view ambiguity. The multi-layer SP maps enable representation of complex internal structures and direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces. Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen inherits powerful 2D diffusion priors and allows for efficient fine-tuning with limited computational resources. Overall, SPGen offers a flexible and efficient solution for generating high-quality 3D reconstructions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2509.12721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation. Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3) Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and computational efficiency.

Through the use of adversarial perturbations with positive semantics, defense-styled prompts, and reinforcement fine-tuning, this method outperforms existing attack techniques by achieving superior performance in a single attempt.

arXiv:2509.12724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components: (1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

This paper presents an innovative Gaussian management approach for high-fidelity object reconstruction, addressing the limitations of existing Gaussian Splatting methods. The approach leverages a densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical harmonics or normals, guided by a surface reconstruction module to enhance reconstruction quality. A lightweight Gaussian representation is developed, allowing adaptive adjustments of the Gaussian orders based on gradient magnitudes, ensuring efficient representation while balancing parameter quantity.

arXiv:2509.12742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting (GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency, achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

Summary:<br />
This paper analyzes and models a set of 8 "master key filters" extracted from depthwise-separable deep networks using the ConvNeXt architecture. The filters are clustered based on receptive fields, showing separable filtering operations and close spatial offsets. The authors model the filters using difference operators and spatial smoothing with Gaussian kernels, finding good qualitative similarities. Two modeling approaches with different scale parameters are tested, with fitting based on spatial spread measures or norm minimization. Experimental results demonstrate that the idealized models accurately predict the learned filters’ behavior in deep networks. This suggests that discrete scale-space filters can effectively approximate filters in depthwise-separable deep networks. <div>
arXiv:2509.12746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8 ``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered ``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel, and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or $l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

Automated evaluation of text-to-image models is complex. Multimodal LLMs have been used to assess image quality, but their understanding of human-relevant concepts like image style is unclear. A study was conducted on image attributes of aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy, composition correctness, object adherence, and style for both LLMs and humans. Human preferences were collected through synthetic image pairs, showing strong correlations between image quality features for human judgment. In contrast, LLMs displayed weaker links between attributes. Further analysis revealed that while humans could easily assess image quality based on specific attributes, such as aesthetics, LLMs struggled with certain aspects like anatomical accuracy. These findings highlight differences in how humans and LLMs perceive and evaluate images. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy, compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together, these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal LLMs perceive images.

<div> Transformer, cross-view object geo-localization, recurrent localization, knowledge distillation, reference feature enhancement <br />
Summary: 
The paper introduces ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object geo-localization Transformer, for the task of determining object locations in high-resolution satellite imagery. ReCOT reformulates the task as a recurrent localization problem, using learnable tokens to encode task-specific intent and iteratively refine predicted locations. The model incorporates a knowledge distillation strategy to transfer segmentation priors for clearer semantic guidance and a Reference Feature Enhancement Module to emphasize object-relevant regions in reference features. Experimental results demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous approaches. <div>

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task, directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation, but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location. To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules: (1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA approaches.

<div> Keywords: True Digital Orthophoto Map, On-the-Fly SfM, 3DGS optimization, real-time, rendering quality 

Summary: 
The article introduces A-TDOM, a method for generating True Digital Orthophoto Maps (TDOM) in near real-time. Traditional TDOM generation methods often face delays due to complex offline processes. A-TDOM utilizes On-the-Fly Structure from Motion (SfM) to compute pose and sparse point clouds for images as they are acquired. It integrates new Gaussians and optimizes them into regions that were previously unseen or coarsely reconstructed. By incorporating orthogonal splatting, A-TDOM can render updates of the 3DGS field after each new image. Initial experiments demonstrate that A-TDOM can efficiently render TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization for each new image completed in seconds, while maintaining acceptable rendering quality and geometric accuracy. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc. However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field. Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality and TDOM geometric accuracy.

<div> Keywords: Medical image segmentation, DyGLNet, global and local features, dynamic upsampling mechanism, efficient

Summary:<br /><br />
The paper introduces DyGLNet, a novel approach for medical image segmentation that combines global and local features with a dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model incorporates a hybrid feature extraction module (SHDCBlock) that utilizes single-head self-attention and multi-scale dilated convolutions to capture both local details and global context. Additionally, a dynamic adaptive upsampling module (DyFusionUp) is introduced to enhance feature map reconstruction based on learnable offsets. The lightweight design of DyGLNet reduces computational overhead while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Experimental results on seven public datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, especially in boundary accuracy and small-object segmentation. DyGLNet offers an efficient and reliable solution for clinical medical image analysis, providing a balance between accuracy and computational complexity. The code for DyGLNet will be released soon for further exploration and implementation. <div>

<title>BATR-FST: Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for Few-Shot Transformers</title>

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement. To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling (MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability. Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and improves the few-shot classification via transformers.

<title>CECT-Mamba: a Hierarchical Contrast-enhanced-aware Model for Pancreatic Tumor Subtyping from Multi-phase CECT</title>

arXiv:2509.12777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet structures . This enables our model to identify tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns language with image content at both global and regional levels. These contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

<title>Double Helix Diffusion for Cross-Domain Anomaly Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2) the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation, connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

Abstract: Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we leverage a large-scale pretrained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various applications.

Abstract: The creation of high-quality 3D assets, a cornerstone of modern game development, has long been characterized by labor-intensive and specialized workflows. This paper presents Hunyuan3D Studio, an end-to-end AI-powered content creation platform designed to revolutionize the game production pipeline by automating and streamlining the generation of game-ready 3D assets. At its core, Hunyuan3D Studio integrates a suite of advanced neural modules (such as Part-level 3D Generation, Polygon Generation, Semantic UV, etc.) into a cohesive and user-friendly system. This unified framework allows for the rapid transformation of a single concept image or textual description into a fully-realized, production-quality 3D model complete with optimized geometry and high-fidelity PBR textures. We demonstrate that assets generated by Hunyuan3D Studio are not only visually compelling but also adhere to the stringent technical requirements of contemporary game engines, significantly reducing iteration time and lowering the barrier to entry for 3D content creation. By providing a seamless bridge from creative intent to technical asset, Hunyuan3D Studio represents a significant leap forward for AI-assisted workflows in game development and interactive media.

Abstract: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck, particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$ to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly, which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps, contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency and model effectiveness.

Abstract: Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However, medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets, limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation. While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings, we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks. Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models. These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining, enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by utilizing in-domain data.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however, remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

<title>Leveraging Large Language Models to Effectively Generate Visual Data for Canine Musculoskeletal Diagnoses</title>

Abstract: It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications, offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding, chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000 synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation) diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations. These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques can be adapted to other fields.

<title>Cumulative Consensus Score: Label-Free and Model-Agnostic Evaluation of Object Detectors in Deployment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.12871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations. In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90% congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to segment novel categories using a minimal number of annotated support samples. While existing prototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two critical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited representational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2) Inter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are misaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative capability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional encoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the prototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the Prototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity prototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream learner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic Learner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel Diffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting dual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM), which adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively align the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration Mechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent semantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets demonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various few-shot settings.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge. Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM, equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

Abstract: Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity and editability.

<title>MEJO: MLLM-Engaged Surgical Triplet Recognition via Inter- and Intra-Task Joint Optimization</title>

Abstract: Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb, target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1) inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally, comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities. To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

Abstract: We introduce DialNav, a novel collaborative embodied dialog task, where a navigation agent (Navigator) and a remote guide (Guide) engage in multi-turn dialog to reach a goal location. Unlike prior work, DialNav aims for holistic evaluation and requires the Guide to infer the Navigator's location, making communication essential for task success. To support this task, we collect and release the Remote Assistance in Navigation (RAIN) dataset, human-human dialog paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both navigation and dialog, and conduct extensive experiments analyzing the impact of different Navigator and Guide models. We highlight key challenges and publicly release the dataset, code, and evaluation framework to foster future research in embodied dialog.

<title>Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing: Enhancing Visual Understanding via Sustained Focus on Key Objects in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12897</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12897</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.12897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers, the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly. Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

<title>MSGFusion: Multimodal Scene Graph-Guided Infrared and Visible Image Fusion</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12901</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.12901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast, and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images. Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities, attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities, attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection, semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

<title>AREPAS: Anomaly Detection in Fine-Grained Anatomy with Reconstruction-Based Semantic Patch-Scoring</title>

Abstract: Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment, differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

<title>T-SiamTPN: Temporal Siamese Transformer Pyramid Networks for Robust and Efficient UAV Tracking</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12913</link>

Abstract: Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations, dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies, resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion. Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions, strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations. These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1 FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains: compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and efficient solution for aerial object tracking.

<title>A Novel Compression Framework for YOLOv8: Achiev-ing Real-Time Aerial Object Detection on Edge Devices via Structured Pruning and Channel-Wise Distillation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12918</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.12918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels, significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to 13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from 26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

<title>MATTER: Multiscale Attention for Registration Error Regression</title>

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e.,~{\it PCR quality validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art classification-based method.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a 4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale, generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations. Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

<title>Beyond Averages: Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding with Gaussian Splatting and Bag of Embeddings</title>

Abstract: Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics. While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation, creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects. This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.

<title>Time-step Mixup for Efficient Spiking Knowledge Transfer from Appearance to Event Domain</title>

Abstract: The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks holds great promise for energy-efficient visual processing. However, the limited availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives. These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training, and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review process.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario. Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities, an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces the NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on average on DeLiVER and up to 1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.

Abstract: Text line segmentation is a critical step in handwritten document image analysis. Segmenting text lines in historical handwritten documents, however, presents unique challenges due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, and complex layouts with overlapping lines and non-linear text flow. Furthermore, the scarcity of large annotated datasets renders fully supervised learning approaches impractical for such materials. To address these challenges, we introduce the Few-Shot Text Line Segmentation of Ancient Handwritten Documents (FEST) Competition. Participants are tasked with developing systems capable of segmenting text lines in U-DIADS-TL dataset, using only three annotated images per manuscript for training. The competition dataset features a diverse collection of ancient manuscripts exhibiting a wide range of layouts, degradation levels, and non-standard formatting, closely reflecting real-world conditions. By emphasizing few-shot learning, FEST competition aims to promote the development of robust and adaptable methods that can be employed by humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation effort, thus fostering broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

Abstract: This SHREC 2025 track dedicated to protein surface shape retrieval involved 9 participating teams. We evaluated the performance in retrieval of 15 proposed methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics (Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.

<title>Improving Accuracy and Efficiency of Implicit Neural Representations: Making SIREN a WINNER</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.12980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep neural network training.

Abstract: Omnidirectional vision, using 360-degree vision to understand the environment, has become increasingly critical across domains like robotics, industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Compared to traditional pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest. We highlight recent breakthroughs in omnidirectional generation, omnidirectional perception, omnidirectional understanding, and related datasets. Drawing on insights from both academia and industry, we propose an ideal panoramic system architecture in the embodied AI era, PANORAMA, which consists of four key subsystems. Moreover, we offer in-depth opinions related to emerging trends and cross-community impacts at the intersection of panoramic vision and embodied AI, along with the future roadmap and open challenges. This overview synthesizes state-of-the-art advancements and outlines challenges and opportunities for future research in building robust, general-purpose omnidirectional AI systems in the embodied AI era.

Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/DR-MoE.

<title>Brought a Gun to a Knife Fight: Modern VFM Baselines Outgun Specialized Detectors on In-the-Wild AI Image Detection</title>

Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.
  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder, Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date, ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection, the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the `craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history, including pre-training.

Abstract: Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras (event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations that lack power infrastructure.

<title>Dream3DAvatar: Text-Controlled 3D Avatar Reconstruction from a Single Image</title>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input, making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS) from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready 3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

<title>Perception Before Reasoning: Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning for Visual Reasoning in Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13031</link>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance. However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

<title>HERO: Rethinking Visual Token Early Dropping in High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities. However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient inference in HR-LVLMs.

<title>TFANet: Three-Stage Image-Text Feature Alignment Network for Robust Referring Image Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13070</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions based on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two modalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS), Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM), which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes. Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation introduced in earlier stages.

<title>Using KL-Divergence to Focus Frequency Information in Low-Light Image Enhancement</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.13083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at: https://github.com/YanXY000/LLFDisc

<title>Enhancing Dual Network Based Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation with Uncertainty-Guided Pseudo-Labeling</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13084</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13084</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.13084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings (e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed modules is further validated via ablation experiments.

<title>A Synthetic Data Pipeline for Supporting Manufacturing SMEs in Visual Assembly Control</title>

Abstract: Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95) up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated deepfake technology poses significant challenges to digital security and authenticity. Detecting these forgeries, especially across a wide spectrum of manipulation techniques, requires robust and generalized models. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Deep Fusion Framework (HDFF), an ensemble-based deep learning architecture designed for high-performance facial forgery detection. Our framework integrates four diverse pre-trained sub-models, Swin-MLP, CoAtNet, EfficientNetV2, and DaViT, which are meticulously fine-tuned through a multi-stage process on the MultiFFDI dataset. By concatenating the feature representations from these specialized models and training a final classifier layer, HDFF effectively leverages their collective strengths. This approach achieved a final score of 0.96852 on the competition's private leaderboard, securing the 20th position out of 184 teams, demonstrating the efficacy of hierarchical fusion for complex image classification tasks.

Abstract: Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations, and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.

<title>Advancing Real-World Parking Slot Detection with Large-Scale Dataset and Semi-Supervised Baseline</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13133</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.13133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As automatic parking systems evolve, the accurate detection of parking slots has become increasingly critical. This study focuses on parking slot detection using surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the parking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light, occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant the gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme. The relevant source codes and the dataset have been made publicly available at https://github.com/zzh362/CRPS-D.

<title>MSDNet: Efficient 4D Radar Super-Resolution via Multi-Stage Distillation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13149</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.13149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling, resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Recognizing textual attributes such as bold, italic, underline and strikeout is essential for understanding text semantics, structure, and visual presentation. These attributes highlight key information, making them crucial for document analysis. Existing methods struggle with computational efficiency or adaptability in noisy, multilingual settings. To address this, we introduce TexTAR, a multi-task, context-aware Transformer for Textual Attribute Recognition (TAR). Our novel data selection pipeline enhances context awareness, and our architecture employs a 2D RoPE (Rotary Positional Embedding)-style mechanism to incorporate input context for more accurate attribute predictions. We also introduce MMTAD, a diverse, multilingual, multi-domain dataset annotated with text attributes across real-world documents such as legal records, notices, and textbooks. Extensive evaluations show TexTAR outperforms existing methods, demonstrating that contextual awareness contributes to state-of-the-art TAR performance.

Abstract: Despite the prosperity of the video language model, the current pursuit of comprehensive video reasoning is thwarted by the inherent spatio-temporal incompleteness within individual videos, resulting in hallucinations and inaccuracies. A promising solution is to augment the reasoning performance with multiple related videos. However, video tokens are numerous and contain redundant information, so directly feeding the relevant video data into a large language model to enhance responses could be counterproductive. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-video collaborative framework for video language models. For efficient and flexible video representation, we establish a Video Structuring Module to represent the video's knowledge as a spatio-temporal graph. Based on the structured video representation, we design the Graph Fusion Module to fuse the structured knowledge and valuable information from related videos into the augmented graph node tokens. Finally, we construct an elaborate multi-video structured prompt to integrate the graph, visual, and textual tokens as the input to the large language model. Extensive experiments substantiate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its potential as a promising avenue for advancing video language models.

Abstract: Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city, richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50 species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics, WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory. We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization, spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree asset management. The WHU-STree dataset is accessible at: https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/WHU-STree.

arXiv:2509.13175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments) without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale "silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard" dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to facilitate {\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems.

Abstract: With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous navigation. However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal, since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video sequences, providing valuable insights and direction for future research.

Abstract: Violence detection in public surveillance is critical for public safety. This study addresses challenges such as small-scale targets, complex environments, and real-time temporal analysis. We propose Vi-SAFE, a spatial-temporal framework that integrates an enhanced YOLOv8 with a Temporal Segment Network (TSN) for video surveillance. The YOLOv8 model is optimized with GhostNetV3 as a lightweight backbone, an exponential moving average (EMA) attention mechanism, and pruning to reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy. YOLOv8 and TSN are trained separately on pedestrian and violence datasets, where YOLOv8 extracts human regions and TSN performs binary classification of violent behavior. Experiments on the RWF-2000 dataset show that Vi-SAFE achieves an accuracy of 0.88, surpassing TSN alone (0.77) and outperforming existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating its effectiveness for public safety surveillance. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Vi-SAFE-3B42/README.md.

arXiv:2509.13214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements, diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically, End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset will be released soon.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL) framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/hugocarlesso/CMTSSL.

Abstract: Ensuring consistent quality in vacuum thermoforming presents challenges due to variations in material properties and tooling configurations. This research introduces a vision-based quality control system to predict and optimise process parameters, thereby enhancing part quality with minimal data requirements. A comprehensive dataset was developed using visual data from vacuum-formed samples subjected to various process parameters, supplemented by image augmentation techniques to improve model training. A k-Nearest Neighbour algorithm was subsequently employed to identify adjustments needed in process parameters by mapping low-quality parts to their high-quality counterparts. The model exhibited strong performance in adjusting heating power, heating time, and vacuum time to reduce defects and improve production efficiency.

Abstract: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation, require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT) architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model. Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost (up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

Abstract: We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports. Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated, AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners. In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to 17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases. RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable, feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI resources in education.

Abstract: A reliable method of quantifying the perceptual realness of AI-generated images and identifying visually inconsistent regions is crucial for practical use of AI-generated images and for improving photorealism of generative AI via realness feedback during training. This paper introduces a framework that accomplishes both overall objective realness assessment and local inconsistency identification of AI-generated images using textual descriptions of visual inconsistencies generated by vision-language models trained on large datasets that serve as reliable substitutes for human annotations. Our results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal approach improves objective realness prediction performance and produces dense realness maps that effectively distinguish between realistic and unrealistic spatial regions.

<title>StyleSculptor: Zero-Shot Style-Controllable 3D Asset Generation with Texture-Geometry Dual Guidance</title>

Abstract: Creating 3D assets that follow the texture and geometry style of existing ones is often desirable or even inevitable in practical applications like video gaming and virtual reality. While impressive progress has been made in generating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D assets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose StyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D assets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous works, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner, enabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or both styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a novel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a dynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for style-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling stable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate semantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature selection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of 3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels, allowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With SD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or both-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we further propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style intensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

Abstract: We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings, which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth 3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric measurements.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with high inter-patient variance in rate of cognitive decline. AD progression prediction aims to forecast patient cognitive decline and benefits from incorporating multiple neuroimaging modalities. However, existing multimodal models fail to make accurate predictions when many modalities are missing during inference, as is often the case in clinical settings. To increase multimodal model flexibility under high modality missingness, we introduce PerM-MoE, a novel sparse mixture-of-experts method that uses independent routers for each modality in place of the conventional, single router. Using T1-weighted MRI, FLAIR, amyloid beta PET, and tau PET neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we evaluate PerM-MoE, state-of-the-art Flex-MoE, and unimodal neuroimaging models on predicting two-year change in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores under varying levels of modality missingness. PerM-MoE outperforms the state of the art in most variations of modality missingness and demonstrates more effective utility of experts than Flex-MoE.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of machining deformation in structural components is essential for ensuring dimensional precision and reliability. Such deformation often originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence vary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods for modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are computationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered. Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently solving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in accelerating residual stress-deformation analysis. However, their direct application across changing geometric domains faces theoretical and practical limitations. To address this challenge, a novel framework based on diffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural operator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are explicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural network constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is then trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of deformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the diffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient prediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The proposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient solution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying geometries. The proposed method is validated to predict both main-direction and multi-direction deformation fields, achieving high accuracy and efficiency across parts with diverse geometries including component types, dimensions and features.

Abstract: This work introduces InJecteD, a framework for interpreting Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) by analyzing sample trajectories during the denoising process of 2D point cloud generation. We apply this framework to three datasets from the Datasaurus Dozen bullseye, dino, and circle using a simplified DDPM architecture with customizable input and time embeddings. Our approach quantifies trajectory properties, including displacement, velocity, clustering, and drift field dynamics, using statistical metrics such as Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity. By enhancing model transparency, InJecteD supports human AI collaboration by enabling practitioners to debug and refine generative models. Experiments reveal distinct denoising phases: initial noise exploration, rapid shape formation, and final refinement, with dataset-specific behaviors example, bullseyes concentric convergence vs. dinos complex contour formation. We evaluate four model configurations, varying embeddings and noise schedules, demonstrating that Fourier based embeddings improve trajectory stability and reconstruction quality

Abstract: This paper develops an autonomous agentic framework called V-Math that aims to assist Vietnamese high school students in preparing for the National High School Graduation Mathematics Exams (NHSGMEs). The salient framework integrates three specialized AI agents: a specification-matrix-conditioned question generator, a solver/explainer for detailed step-by-step reasoning, and a personalized tutor that adapts to student performance. Beyond enabling self-paced student practice, V-Math supports teachers by generating innovative, compliant exam questions and building diverse, high-quality question banks. This reduces manual workload and enriches instructional resources. We describe the system architecture, focusing on practice modes for learners and teacher-oriented features for question generation. Preliminary evaluations demonstrate that V-Math produces matrix-aligned exams with high solution accuracy, delivers coherent explanations, and enhances the variety of practice materials. These results highlight its potential to support scalable, equitable mathematics preparation aligned with national standards while also empowering teachers through AI-assisted exam creation.

Abstract: Controlling environmental conditions and monitoring plant status in greenhouses is critical to promptly making appropriate management decisions aimed at promoting crop production. The primary objective of this research study was to develop and test a smart aeroponic greenhouse on an experimental scale where the status of Geranium plant and environmental conditions are continuously monitored through the integration of the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). An IoT-based platform was developed to control the environmental conditions of plants more efficiently and provide insights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we developed an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19, InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured periodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI framework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status. Preliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse environment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow, and volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the controlled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants. Furthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19 algorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy leaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms.

Abstract: Existing deep learning models for chest radiology often neglect patient metadata, limiting diagnostic accuracy and fairness. To bridge this gap, we introduce MetaCheX, a novel multimodal framework that integrates chest X-ray images with structured patient metadata to replicate clinical decision-making. Our approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone with metadata processed by a multilayer perceptron through a shared classifier. Evaluated on the CheXpert Plus dataset, MetaCheX consistently outperformed radiograph-only baseline models across multiple CNN architectures. By integrating metadata, the overall diagnostic accuracy was significantly improved, measured by an increase in AUROC. The results of this study demonstrate that metadata reduces algorithmic bias and enhances model generalizability across diverse patient populations. MetaCheX advances clinical artificial intelligence toward robust, context-aware radiographic disease detection.

Abstract: Multiview ideals arise from the geometry of image formation in pinhole cameras, and universal multiview ideals are their analogs for unknown cameras. We prove that a natural collection of polynomials form a universal Gr\"obner basis for both types of ideals using a criterion introduced by Huang and Larson, and include a proof of their criterion in our setting. Symmetry reduction and induction enable the method to be deployed on an infinite family of ideals. We also give an explicit description of the matroids on which the methodology depends, in the context of multiview ideals.

Abstract: Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) exhibit immense potential for navigating indoor and hard-to-reach areas, yet their significant constraints in payload and autonomy have largely prevented their use for complex tasks like high-quality 3-Dimensional (3D) reconstruction. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous, high-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100 grams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates a real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A near-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate an instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model quality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently capture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data acquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline employs a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) approach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB) location data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this architecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs. Our experiments, conducted in both single- and multi-UAV configurations, conclusively show that dynamic trajectory adaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight paths. This work demonstrates a scalable and autonomous solution that unlocks the potential of miniaturized UAVs for fine-grained 3D reconstruction in constrained environments, a capability previously limited to much larger platforms.

Abstract: Anomaly detection and classification in medical imaging are critical for early diagnosis but remain challenging due to limited annotated data, class imbalance, and the high cost of expert labeling. Emerging vision foundation models such as DINOv2, pretrained on extensive, unlabeled datasets, offer generalized representations that can potentially alleviate these limitations. In this study, we propose an attention-based global aggregation framework tailored specifically for 3D medical image anomaly classification. Leveraging the self-supervised DINOv2 model as a pretrained feature extractor, our method processes individual 2D axial slices of brain MRIs, assigning adaptive slice-level importance weights through a soft attention mechanism. To further address data scarcity, we employ a composite loss function combining supervised contrastive learning with class-variance regularization, enhancing inter-class separability and intra-class consistency. We validate our framework on the ADNI dataset and an institutional multi-class headache cohort, demonstrating strong anomaly classification performance despite limited data availability and significant class imbalance. Our results highlight the efficacy of utilizing pretrained 2D foundation models combined with attention-based slice aggregation for robust volumetric anomaly detection in medical imaging. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Rafsani/DinoAtten3D.git.

Abstract: The increasing prevalence of retinal diseases poses a significant challenge to the healthcare system, as the demand for ophthalmologists surpasses the available workforce. This imbalance creates a bottleneck in diagnosis and treatment, potentially delaying critical care. Traditional methods of generating medical reports from retinal images rely on manual interpretation, which is time-consuming and prone to errors, further straining ophthalmologists' limited resources. This thesis investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate medical report generation for retinal images. AI can quickly analyze large volumes of image data, identifying subtle patterns essential for accurate diagnosis. By automating this process, AI systems can greatly enhance the efficiency of retinal disease diagnosis, reducing doctors' workloads and enabling them to focus on more complex cases. The proposed AI-based methods address key challenges in automated report generation: (1) A multi-modal deep learning approach captures interactions between textual keywords and retinal images, resulting in more comprehensive medical reports; (2) Improved methods for medical keyword representation enhance the system's ability to capture nuances in medical terminology; (3) Strategies to overcome RNN-based models' limitations, particularly in capturing long-range dependencies within medical descriptions; (4) Techniques to enhance the interpretability of the AI-based report generation system, fostering trust and acceptance in clinical practice. These methods are rigorously evaluated using various metrics and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This thesis demonstrates AI's potential to revolutionize retinal disease diagnosis by automating medical report generation, ultimately improving clinical efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, and patient care.

Abstract: Logit Knowledge Distillation has gained substantial research interest in recent years due to its simplicity and lack of requirement for intermediate feature alignment; however, it suffers from limited interpretability in its decision-making process. To address this, we propose implicit Clustering Distillation (iCD): a simple and effective method that mines and transfers interpretable structural knowledge from logits, without requiring ground-truth labels or feature-space alignment. iCD leverages Gram matrices over decoupled local logit representations to enable student models to learn latent semantic structural patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of iCD across diverse teacher-student architectures, with particularly strong performance in fine-grained classification tasks -- achieving a peak improvement of +5.08% over the baseline. The code is available at: https://github.com/maomaochongaa/iCD.

Abstract: We present LightVLA, a simple yet effective differentiable token pruning framework for vision-language-action (VLA) models. While VLA models have shown impressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment on resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy attention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA addresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual tokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and adopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through fine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens while pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby improving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires no heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters, making it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token pruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher success rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically, LightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9% improvement in task success rate. Meanwhile, we also investigate the learnable query-based token pruning method LightVLA* with additional trainable parameters, which also achieves satisfactory performance. Our work reveals that as VLA pursues optimal performance, LightVLA spontaneously learns to prune tokens from a performance-driven perspective. To the best of our knowledge, LightVLA is the first work to apply adaptive visual token pruning to VLA tasks with the collateral goals of efficiency and performance, marking a significant step toward more efficient, powerful and practical real-time robotic systems.

Existing MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and often use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While effective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training costs. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However, prior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend on expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended active exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and plausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose ActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through multi-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is used for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively predicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and optimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL efficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail or likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations. Experiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL baselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training methods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches despite using a smaller model. Code and data will be released soon.

Abstract: Phase retrieval in inline holography is a fundamental yet ill-posed inverse problem due to the nonlinear coupling between amplitude and phase in coherent imaging. We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework with separate likelihood gradients for amplitude and phase, our method enables complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes, imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups. Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures, highlighting the method's adaptability. This framework provides a cost-effective, generalizable solution for nonlinear inverse problems in computational imaging, and establishes a foundation for broader coherent imaging applications beyond holography.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential in medical AI. Evidential Deep Learning (EDL) offers a computationally efficient way to quantify model uncertainty alongside predictions, unlike traditional methods such as Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout and Deep Ensembles (DE). However, all these methods often rely on a single expert's annotations as ground truth for model training, overlooking the inter-rater variability in healthcare. To address this issue, we propose MEGAN, a Multi-Expert Gating Network that aggregates uncertainty estimates and predictions from multiple AI experts via EDL models trained with diverse ground truths and modeling strategies. MEGAN's gating network optimally combines predictions and uncertainties from each EDL model, enhancing overall prediction confidence and calibration. We extensively benchmark MEGAN on endoscopy videos for Ulcerative colitis (UC) disease severity estimation, assessed by visual labeling of Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES), where inter-rater variability is prevalent. In large-scale prospective UC clinical trial, MEGAN achieved a 3.5% improvement in F1-score and a 30.5% reduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to existing methods. Furthermore, MEGAN facilitated uncertainty-guided sample stratification, reducing the annotation burden and potentially increasing efficiency and consistency in UC trials.

Abstract: Gestures are central to human communication, enriching interactions through non-verbal expression. Virtual avatars increasingly use AI-generated gestures to enhance life-likeness, yet evaluations have largely been confined to 2D. Virtual Reality (VR) provides an immersive alternative that may affect how gestures are perceived. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of computer-generated gestures in VR and 2D, examining three models from the 2023 GENEA Challenge. Results show that gestures viewed in VR were rated slightly higher on average, with the strongest effect observed for motion-capture "true movement." While model rankings remained consistent across settings, VR influenced participants' overall perception and offered unique benefits over traditional 2D evaluation.

Abstract: Visual-inertial fusion is crucial for a large amount of intelligent and autonomous applications, such as robot navigation and augmented reality. To bootstrap and achieve optimal state estimation, the spatial-temporal displacements between IMU and cameras must be calibrated in advance. Most existing calibration methods adopt continuous-time state representation, more specifically the B-spline. Despite these methods achieve precise spatial-temporal calibration, they suffer from high computational cost caused by continuous-time state representation. To this end, we propose a novel and extremely efficient calibration method that unleashes the power of discrete-time state representation. Moreover, the weakness of discrete-time state representation in temporal calibration is tackled in this paper. With the increasing production of drones, cellphones and other visual-inertial platforms, if one million devices need calibration around the world, saving one minute for the calibration of each device means saving 2083 work days in total. To benefit both the research and industry communities, our code will be open-source.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function, combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1 substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks. These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications. Our code will be available at https://github.com/YBYBZhang/Tool-R1.

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception, thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency, to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic decision-making.

Abstract: Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar, leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains. Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open, lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician trust in clinical workflows.

Abstract: Charts are a crucial visual medium for communicating and representing information. While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made progress on chart question answering (CQA), the task remains challenging, particularly when models attend to irrelevant regions of the chart. In this work, we present ChartGaze, a new eye-tracking dataset that captures human gaze patterns during chart reasoning tasks. Through a systematic comparison of human and model attention, we find that LVLMs often diverge from human gaze, leading to reduced interpretability and accuracy. To address this, we propose a gaze-guided attention refinement that aligns image-text attention with human fixations. Our approach improves both answer accuracy and attention alignment, yielding gains of up to 2.56 percentage points across multiple models. These results demonstrate the promise of incorporating human gaze to enhance both the reasoning quality and interpretability of chart-focused LVLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches rely on access to large, high-quality labeled datasets for training, benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features in the data. Obtaining such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data availability and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to produce charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling experiments. With extensive tunable parameters and customizable noise models, QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development, benchmarking, and quantum device research.

Abstract: Hinged on the representation power of neural networks, neural radiance fields (NeRF) have recently emerged as one of the promising and widely applicable methods for 3D object and scene representation. However, NeRF faces challenges in practical applications, such as large-scale scenes and edge devices with a limited amount of memory, where data needs to be processed sequentially. Under such incremental learning scenarios, neural networks are known to suffer catastrophic forgetting: easily forgetting previously seen data after training with new data. We observe that previous incremental learning algorithms are limited by either low performance or memory scalability issues. As such, we develop a Memory-Efficient Incremental Learning algorithm for NeRF (MEIL-NeRF). MEIL-NeRF takes inspiration from NeRF itself in that a neural network can serve as a memory that provides the pixel RGB values, given rays as queries. Upon the motivation, our framework learns which rays to query NeRF to extract previous pixel values. The extracted pixel values are then used to train NeRF in a self-distillation manner to prevent catastrophic forgetting. As a result, MEIL-NeRF demonstrates constant memory consumption and competitive performance.

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) has recently been shown as a promising criterion for unsupervised restoration when no explicit prior model is available. Despite its theoretical appeal, OT still significantly falls short of supervised methods on challenging tasks such as super-resolution, deraining, and dehazing. In this paper, we propose a \emph{sparsity-aware optimal transport} (SOT) framework to bridge this gap by leveraging a key observation: the degradations in these tasks exhibit distinct sparsity in the frequency domain. Incorporating this sparsity prior into OT can significantly reduce the ambiguity of the inverse mapping for restoration and substantially boost performance. We provide analysis to show exploiting degradation sparsity benefits unsupervised restoration learning. Extensive experiments on real-world super-resolution, deraining, and dehazing demonstrate that SOT offers notable performance gains over standard OT, while achieving superior perceptual quality compared to existing supervised and unsupervised methods. In particular, SOT consistently outperforms existing unsupervised methods across all three tasks and narrows the performance gap to supervised counterparts.

Abstract: An experimental study on detecting synthetic face images is presented. We collected a dataset, called FF5, of five fake face image generators, including recent diffusion models. We find that a simple model trained on a specific image generator can achieve near-perfect accuracy in separating synthetic and real images. The model handles common image distortions (reduced resolution, compression) by using data augmentation. Moreover, partial manipulations, where synthetic images are blended into real ones by inpainting, are identified and the area of the manipulation is localized by a simple model of YOLO architecture. However, the model turned out to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks and does not generalize to unseen generators. Failure to generalize to detect images produced by a newer generator also occurs for recent state-of-the-art methods, which we tested on Realistic Vision, a fine-tuned version of StabilityAI's Stable Diffusion image generator.

Abstract: Aerial Remote Sensing (ARS) vision tasks present significant challenges due to the unique viewing angle characteristics. Existing research has primarily focused on algorithms for specific tasks, which have limited applicability in a broad range of ARS vision applications. This paper proposes RingMo-Aerial, aiming to fill the gap in foundation model research in the field of ARS vision. A Frequency-Enhanced Multi-Head Self-Attention (FE-MSA) mechanism is introduced to strengthen the model's capacity for small-object representation. Complementarily, an affine transformation-based contrastive learning method improves its adaptability to the tilted viewing angles inherent in ARS tasks. Furthermore, the ARS-Adapter, an efficient parameter fine-tuning method, is proposed to improve the model's adaptability and performance in various ARS vision tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that RingMo-Aerial achieves SOTA performance on multiple downstream tasks. This indicates the practicality and efficacy of RingMo-Aerial in enhancing the performance of ARS vision tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on enhancing a diffusion-based text-to-video (T2V) model during the post-training phase by distilling a highly capable consistency model from a pretrained T2V model. Our proposed method, T2V-Turbo-v2, introduces a significant advancement by integrating various supervision signals, including high-quality training data, reward model feedback, and conditional guidance, into the consistency distillation process. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we highlight the crucial importance of tailoring datasets to specific learning objectives and the effectiveness of learning from diverse reward models for enhancing both the visual quality and text-video alignment. Additionally, we highlight the vast design space of conditional guidance strategies, which centers on designing an effective energy function to augment the teacher ODE solver. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by extracting motion guidance from the training datasets and incorporating it into the ODE solver, showcasing its effectiveness in improving the motion quality of the generated videos with the improved motion-related metrics from VBench and T2V-CompBench. Empirically, our T2V-Turbo-v2 establishes a new state-of-the-art result on VBench, with a Total score of 85.13, surpassing proprietary systems such as Gen-3 and Kling.

Abstract: Large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks, raising concerns about their deployment in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving and medical diagnosis. One promising approach for robustifying pre-trained VLMs is Adversarial Prompt Tuning (APT), which applies adversarial training during the process of prompt tuning. However, existing APT methods are mostly single-modal methods that design prompt(s) for only the visual or textual modality, limiting their effectiveness in either robustness or clean accuracy. In this work, we propose Adversarial Prompt Distillation (APD), a bimodal knowledge distillation framework that enhances APT by integrating it with multi-modal knowledge transfer. APD optimizes prompts for both visual and textual modalities while distilling knowledge from a clean pre-trained teacher CLIP model. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our APD method over the current state-of-the-art APT methods in terms of both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy. The effectiveness of APD also validates the possibility of using a non-robust teacher to improve the generalization and robustness of fine-tuned VLMs.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) aims at segmenting images from free-form textual concepts without predefined training classes. While existing vision-language models such as CLIP can generate segmentation masks by leveraging coarse spatial information from Vision Transformers, they face challenges in spatial localization due to their global alignment of image and text features. Conversely, self-supervised visual models like DINO excel in fine-grained visual encoding but lack integration with language. To bridge this gap, we present Talk2DINO, a novel hybrid approach that combines the spatial accuracy of DINOv2 with the language understanding of CLIP. Our approach aligns the textual embeddings of CLIP to the patch-level features of DINOv2 through a learned mapping function without the need to fine-tune the underlying backbones. At training time, we exploit the attention maps of DINOv2 to selectively align local visual patches with textual embeddings. We show that the powerful semantic and localization abilities of Talk2DINO can enhance the segmentation process, resulting in more natural and less noisy segmentations, and that our approach can also effectively distinguish foreground objects from the background. Experimental results demonstrate that Talk2DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance across several unsupervised OVS benchmarks.

Abstract: 3D spatial reasoning is the ability to analyze and interpret the positions, orientations, and spatial relationships of objects within the 3D space. This allows models to develop a comprehensive understanding of the 3D scene, enabling their applicability to a broader range of areas, such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and AR/VR. While large multi-modal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in a wide range of image and video understanding tasks, their capabilities to perform 3D spatial reasoning on diverse natural images are less studied. In this work we present the first comprehensive 3D spatial reasoning benchmark, 3DSRBench, with 2,772 manually annotated visual question-answer pairs across 12 question types. We conduct robust and thorough evaluation of 3D spatial reasoning abilities by balancing data distribution and adopting a novel FlipEval strategy. To further study the robustness of 3D spatial reasoning w.r.t. camera 3D viewpoints, our 3DSRBench includes two subsets with 3D spatial reasoning questions on paired images with common and uncommon viewpoints. We benchmark a wide range of open-sourced and proprietary LMMs, uncovering their limitations in various aspects of 3D awareness, such as height, orientation, location, and multi-object reasoning, as well as their degraded performance on images from uncommon 6D viewpoints. Our 3DSRBench provide valuable findings and insights about future development of LMMs with strong spatial reasoning abilities. Our project page is available at https://3dsrbench.github.io/.

Abstract: Adversarial training and adversarial purification are two widely used defense strategies for enhancing model robustness against adversarial attacks. However, adversarial training requires costly retraining, while adversarial purification often suffers from low efficiency. More critically, existing defenses are primarily designed under the perturbation-based adversarial threat model, which is ineffective against recently introduced unrestricted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient defense framework that counters both perturbation-based and unrestricted adversarial attacks. Our approach is motivated by the observation that adversarial examples typically lie near the decision boundary and are highly sensitive to pixel-level perturbations. To address this, we introduce adversarial anti-aliasing, a preprocessing technique that mitigates adversarial noise by reducing the magnitude of pixel-level perturbations. In addition, we propose adversarial super-resolution, which leverages prior knowledge from clean datasets to benignly restore high-quality images from adversarially degraded ones. Unlike image synthesis methods that generate entirely new images, adversarial super-resolution focuses on image restoration, making it more suitable for purification. Importantly, both techniques require no additional training and are computationally efficient since they do not rely on gradient computations. To further improve robustness across diverse datasets, we introduce a contrastive learning-based adversarial deblurring fine-tuning method. By incorporating adversarial priors during fine-tuning on the target dataset, this method enhances purification effectiveness without the need to retrain diffusion models.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have emerged as a promising solution to automate the workflow of machine learning, but most existing methods share a common limitation: they attempt to optimize entire pipelines in a single step before evaluation, making it difficult to attribute improvements to specific changes. This lack of granularity leads to unstable optimization and slower convergence, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we introduce Iterative Refinement, a novel strategy for LLM-driven ML pipeline design inspired by how human ML experts iteratively refine models, focusing on one component at a time rather than making sweeping changes all at once. By systematically updating individual components based on real training feedback, Iterative Refinement improves overall model performance. We also provide some theoretical edvience of the superior properties of this Iterative Refinement. Further, we implement this strategy in IMPROVE, an end-to-end LLM agent framework for automating and optimizing object classification pipelines. Through extensive evaluations across datasets of varying sizes and domains, we demonstrate that Iterative Refinement enables IMPROVE to consistently achieve better performance over existing zero-shot LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is important in computer-aided interventions (CAI). While learning-based point cloud registration methods have been developed, their clinical application is hampered by issues of generalizability and explainability. Therefore, classical point cloud registration methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP), are still widely applied in CAI. ICP methods fail to consider that: (1) the points have well-defined semantic meaning, in that each point can be related to a specific anatomical label; (2) the deformation required for registration needs to follow biomechanical energy constraints. In this paper, we present a novel semantic ICP (SemICP) method that handles multiple point labels and uses linear elastic energy regularization. We use semantic labels to improve the robustness of the closest point matching and propose a novel point cloud deformation representation to apply explicit biomechanical energy regularization. Our experiments on a trans-oral robotic surgery ultrasound-computed tomography registration dataset and two public Learn2reg challenge datasets show that our method improves the Hausdorff distance and mean surface distance compared with other point-matching-based registration methods.

Abstract: We introduce PKR-QA (Procedural Knowledge Reasoning Question Answering), a new benchmark for question answering over procedural tasks that require structured reasoning. PKR-QA is constructed semi-automatically using a procedural knowledge graph (PKG), which encodes task-specific knowledge across diverse domains. The PKG is built by curating and linking information from the COIN instructional video dataset and the ontology, enriched with commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet and structured outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs), followed by manual verification. To generate question-answer pairs, we design graph traversal templates where each template is applied systematically over PKG. To enable interpretable reasoning, we propose a neurosymbolic approach called Knowledge Module Learning (KML), which learns procedural relations via neural modules and composes them for structured reasoning with LLMs. Experiments demonstrate that this paradigm improves reasoning performance on PKR-QA and enables step-by-step reasoning traces that facilitate interpretability. Code and dataset will be released soon https://github.com/LUNAProject22/KML.

<title>HierRelTriple: Guiding Indoor Layout Generation with Hierarchical Relationship Triplet Losses</title>

Abstract: We present a hierarchical triplet-based indoor relationship learning method, coined HierRelTriple, with a focus on spatial relationship learning. Existing approaches often depend on manually defined spatial rules or simplified pairwise representations, which fail to capture complex, multi-object relationships found in real scenarios and lead to overcrowded or physically implausible arrangements. We introduce HierRelTriple, a hierarchical relational triplets modeling framework that first partitions functional regions and then automatically extracts three levels of spatial relationships: object-to-region (O2R), object-to-object (O2O), and corner-to-corner (C2C). By representing these relationships as geometric triplets and employing approaches based on Delaunay Triangulation to establish spatial priors, we derive IoU loss between denoised and ground truth triplets and integrate them seamlessly into the diffusion denoising process. The introduction of the joint formulation of inter-object distances, angular orientations, and spatial relationships enhances the physical realism of the generated scenes. Extensive experiments on unconditional layout synthesis, floorplan-conditioned layout generation, and scene rearrangement demonstrate that HierRelTriple improves spatial-relation metrics by over 15% and substantially reduces collisions and boundary violations compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Palmprint De-Identification Using Diffusion Model for High-Quality and Diverse Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Palmprint recognition techniques have advanced significantly in recent years, enabling reliable recognition even when palmprints are captured in uncontrolled or challenging environments. However, this strength also introduces new risks, as publicly available palmprint images can be misused by adversaries for malicious activities. Despite this growing concern, research on methods to obscure or anonymize palmprints remains largely unexplored. Thus, it is essential to develop a palmprint de-identification technique capable of removing identity-revealing features while retaining the image's utility and preserving non-sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework that utilizes pre-trained diffusion models to generate diverse, high-quality palmprint images that conceal identity features for de-identification purposes. To ensure greater stability and controllability in the synthesis process, we incorporate a semantic-guided embedding fusion alongside a prior interpolation mechanism. We further propose the de-identification ratio, a novel metric for intuitive de-identification assessment. Extensive experiments across multiple palmprint datasets and recognition methods demonstrate that our method effectively conceals identity-related traits with significant diversity across de-identified samples. The de-identified samples preserve high visual fidelity and maintain excellent usability, achieving a balance between de-identification and retaining non-identity information.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) requires effectively integrating multimodal data and clinical expertise. However, existing methods often struggle to fully utilize multimodal information and lack structured mechanisms to incorporate dynamic domain knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose HoloDx, a knowledge- and data-driven framework that enhances AD diagnosis by aligning domain knowledge with multimodal clinical data. HoloDx incorporates a knowledge injection module with a knowledge-aware gated cross-attention, allowing the model to dynamically integrate domain-specific insights from both large language models (LLMs) and clinical expertise. Also, a memory injection module with a designed prototypical memory attention enables the model to retain and retrieve subject-specific information, ensuring consistency in decision-making. By jointly leveraging these mechanisms, HoloDx enhances interpretability, improves robustness, and effectively aligns prior knowledge with current subject data. Evaluations on five AD datasets demonstrate that HoloDx outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior diagnostic accuracy and strong generalization across diverse cohorts. The source code will be released upon publication acceptance.

<title>Cross-Image Contrastive Decoding: Precise, Lossless Suppression of Language Priors in Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Over-reliance on language priors is a major cause of hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), often leading to outputs that are linguistically plausible but visually inconsistent. Recent studies have explored contrastive decoding as a training-free solution. However, these methods typically construct contrastive visual inputs by perturbing the original image, resulting in distorted contrastive distributions, incomplete contrastive signals, and excessive suppression of language priors. Motivated by the observation that language priors tend to remain consistent across different images, we propose Cross-Image Contrastive Decoding (CICD), a simple yet effective training-free method that uses unrelated images as contrastive visual inputs. To address the issue of over-suppressing language priors, which can negatively affect the quality of generated responses, we further introduce a dynamic selection mechanism based on the cross-image differences in model behavior. By selectively suppressing language priors, our method reduces hallucinations without compromising the model's performance. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of CICD, particularly in image captioning, where language priors are especially dominant.

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models have demonstrated their great capability in generating visually-pleasing results, while synthesizing the correct physical effects in generated videos remains challenging. The complexity of real-world motions, interactions, and dynamics introduce great difficulties when learning physics from data. In this work, we propose DiffPhy, a generic framework that enables physically-correct and photo-realistic video generation by fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion model. Our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to explicitly reason a comprehensive physical context from the text prompt and use it to guide the generation. To incorporate physical context into the diffusion model, we leverage a Multimodal large language model (MLLM) as a supervisory signal and introduce a set of novel training objectives that jointly enforce physical correctness and semantic consistency with the input text. We also establish a high-quality physical video dataset containing diverse phyiscal actions and events to facilitate effective finetuning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPhy is able to produce state-of-the-art results across diverse physics-related scenarios.

Abstract: Generating 3D worlds from text is a highly anticipated goal in computer vision. Existing works are limited by the degree of exploration they allow inside of a scene, i.e., produce streched-out and noisy artifacts when moving beyond central or panoramic perspectives. To this end, we propose WorldExplorer, a novel method based on autoregressive video trajectory generation, which builds fully navigable 3D scenes with consistent visual quality across a wide range of viewpoints. We initialize our scenes by creating multi-view consistent images corresponding to a 360 degree panorama. Then, we expand it by leveraging video diffusion models in an iterative scene generation pipeline. Concretely, we generate multiple videos along short, pre-defined trajectories, that explore the scene in depth, including motion around objects. Our novel scene memory conditions each video on the most relevant prior views, while a collision-detection mechanism prevents degenerate results, like moving into objects. Finally, we fuse all generated views into a unified 3D representation via 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization. Compared to prior approaches, WorldExplorer produces high-quality scenes that remain stable under large camera motion, enabling for the first time realistic and unrestricted exploration. We believe this marks a significant step toward generating immersive and truly explorable virtual 3D environments.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing has seen significant progress in natural image domains, but its application in medical imaging remains limited and lacks standardized evaluation frameworks. Such editing could revolutionize clinical practices by enabling personalized surgical planning, enhancing medical education, and improving patient communication. To bridge this gap, we introduce MedEBench1, a robust benchmark designed to diagnose reliability in text-guided medical image editing. MedEBench consists of 1,182 clinically curated image-prompt pairs covering 70 distinct editing tasks and 13 anatomical regions. It contributes in three key areas: (1) a clinically grounded evaluation framework that measures Editing Accuracy, Context Preservation, and Visual Quality, complemented by detailed descriptions of intended edits and corresponding Region-of-Interest (ROI) masks; (2) a comprehensive comparison of seven state-of-theart models, revealing consistent patterns of failure; and (3) a diagnostic error analysis technique that leverages attention alignment, using Intersection-over-Union (IoU) between model attention maps and ROI masks to identify mislocalization issues, where models erroneously focus on incorrect anatomical regions. MedEBench sets the stage for developing more reliable and clinically effective text-guided medical image editing tools.

Abstract: Multimodal medical analysis combining image and tabular data has gained increasing attention. However, effective fusion remains challenging due to cross-modal discrepancies in feature dimensions and modality contributions, as well as the noise from high-dimensional tabular inputs. To address these problems, we present AMF-MedIT, an efficient Align-Modulation-Fusion framework for medical image and tabular data integration, particularly under data-scarce conditions. Built upon a self-supervised learning strategy, we introduce the Adaptive Modulation and Fusion (AMF) module, a novel, streamlined fusion paradigm that harmonizes dimension discrepancies and dynamically balances modality contributions. It integrates prior knowledge to guide the allocation of modality contributions in the fusion and employs feature masks together with magnitude and leakage losses to adjust the dimensionality and magnitude of unimodal features. Additionally, we develop FT-Mamba, a powerful tabular encoder leveraging a selective mechanism to handle noisy medical tabular data efficiently. Extensive experiments, including simulations of clinical noise, demonstrate that AMF-MedIT achieves superior accuracy, robustness, and data efficiency across multimodal classification tasks. Interpretability analyses further reveal how FT-Mamba shapes multimodal pretraining and enhances the image encoder's attention, highlighting the practical value of our framework for reliable and efficient clinical artificial intelligence applications.

<title>Visual Contextual Attack: Jailbreaking MLLMs with Image-Driven Context Injection</title>

Abstract: With the emergence of strong vision language capabilities, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world applications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual modality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world environments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from target MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs. However, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger for unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding in realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: vision-centric jailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in constructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this setting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates contextual dialogue using four distinct vision-focused strategies, dynamically generating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a vision-centric jailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic toxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt that reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs. Specifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming the baseline, which achieves a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%.

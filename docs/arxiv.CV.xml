Summary:
The article introduces the GAZE pipeline, a production-tested system that automates the conversion of raw videos into task-ready supervision for training robust world models. The system normalizes 360-degree video formats, utilizes AI models for pre-annotation, and consolidates signals for human validation, resulting in efficiency gains and reduced human review volume.

Abstract: Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription, PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii) consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human validation.
  The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata, our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without sacrificing throughput or governance.

<div> Keywords: Positron Emission Tomography, Poisson noise, denoising methods, PC-UNet, PVMC-Loss

Summary:
The article introduces a new model, the Poisson Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet), designed to address the limitations of high signal-to-noise ratio doses in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. The current denoising methods struggle with handling the increased Poisson noise resulting from lower doses, leading to distortions and artifacts in the images. To combat this issue, the PC-UNet incorporates a new Poisson Variance and Mean Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that integrates physical data to enhance image fidelity. The PVMC-Loss is statistically unbiased and offers robustness to minor data mismatches. The model has been tested on PET datasets, demonstrating improved physical consistency and image fidelity. The results indicate the PC-UNet's efficacy in integrating physical information effectively to enhance the quality of PET images.

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is crucial in medicine, but its clinical use is limited due to high signal-to-noise ratio doses increasing radiation exposure. Lowering doses increases Poisson noise, which current denoising methods fail to handle, causing distortions and artifacts. We propose a Poisson Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) model with a new Poisson Variance and Mean Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data to improve image fidelity. PVMC-Loss is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient adaptation, acting as a Generalized Method of Moments implementation, offering robustness to minor data mismatches. Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet improves physical consistency and image fidelity, proving its ability to integrate physical information effectively.

<div> Keyword: Text-to-Image, semantic leakage, DeLeaker, attention maps, SLIM

Summary:<br><br>Text-to-Image (T2I) models have seen rapid advancements but are still prone to semantic leakage, which unintentionally transfers related features between different entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often complex and input-dependent. DeLeaker is introduced as a lightweight, optimization-free approach that intervenes directly on a model's attention maps at inference time to mitigate leakage. The method dynamically adjusts attention maps to reduce cross-entity interactions while preserving entity identity. To enable systematic evaluation, the Semantic Leakage in Images (SLIM) dataset is introduced, consisting of 1,130 human-verified samples across various scenarios, along with a new automatic evaluation framework. Experimental results show that DeLeaker consistently outperforms baseline methods, even when provided with external information, effectively reducing leakage without sacrificing fidelity or quality. These findings highlight the importance of attention control and open up possibilities for more precise Text-to-Image models.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages), the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130 human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

Abstract: Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware, interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

<div> Framework, 3D object editing, Nano3D, FlowEdit, TRELLIS

Summary:
Nano3D is a novel framework for precise and coherent 3D object editing without the need for masks. By integrating FlowEdit into TRELLIS and introducing region-aware merging strategies (Voxel/Slat-Merge), Nano3D allows for localized edits guided by front-view renderings while preserving structural fidelity. The framework addresses inefficiencies and inconsistencies present in current 3D editing methods, resulting in superior 3D consistency and visual quality. Additionally, the construction of Nano3D-Edit-100k, a large-scale dataset containing over 100,000 high-quality 3D editing pairs, provides valuable resources for further research in the field. Nano3D represents a significant advancement in algorithm design and data availability, improving the generality and reliability of 3D editing and paving the way for the development of feed-forward 3D editing models.

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D object editing is essential for interactive content creation in gaming, animation, and robotics, yet current approaches remain inefficient, inconsistent, and often fail to preserve unedited regions. Most methods rely on editing multi-view renderings followed by reconstruction, which introduces artifacts and limits practicality. To address these challenges, we propose Nano3D, a training-free framework for precise and coherent 3D object editing without masks. Nano3D integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS to perform localized edits guided by front-view renderings, and further introduces region-aware merging strategies, Voxel/Slat-Merge, which adaptively preserve structural fidelity by ensuring consistency between edited and unedited areas. Experiments demonstrate that Nano3D achieves superior 3D consistency and visual quality compared with existing methods. Based on this framework, we construct the first large-scale 3D editing datasets Nano3D-Edit-100k, which contains over 100,000 high-quality 3D editing pairs. This work addresses long-standing challenges in both algorithm design and data availability, significantly improving the generality and reliability of 3D editing, and laying the groundwork for the development of feed-forward 3D editing models.

<div> Keywords: image generation, benchmarks, ECHO framework, GPT-4o Image Gen, social media

Summary:
ECHO is a framework designed to construct benchmarks for image generation models using real-world evidence from social media posts. By curating over 31,000 prompts from these posts, ECHO reveals complex tasks not present in existing benchmarks, such as generating multilingual product labels or receipts with specified totals. The framework also helps in distinguishing state-of-the-art models from others and gathers community feedback to inform the design of quality metrics that measure shifts in color, identity, and structure. The application of ECHO to GPT-4o Image Gen showcases its ability to capture emerging use cases and bridge the gap between community perceptions of progress and formal evaluation processes.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation, often driven by proprietary systems like GPT-4o Image Gen, regularly introduce new capabilities that reshape how users interact with these models. Existing benchmarks often lag behind and fail to capture these emerging use cases, leaving a gap between community perceptions of progress and formal evaluation. To address this, we present ECHO, a framework for constructing benchmarks directly from real-world evidence of model use: social media posts that showcase novel prompts and qualitative user judgments. Applying this framework to GPT-4o Image Gen, we construct a dataset of over 31,000 prompts curated from such posts. Our analysis shows that ECHO (1) discovers creative and complex tasks absent from existing benchmarks, such as re-rendering product labels across languages or generating receipts with specified totals, (2) more clearly distinguishes state-of-the-art models from alternatives, and (3) surfaces community feedback that we use to inform the design of metrics for model quality (e.g., measuring observed shifts in color, identity, and structure).

Summary: 
The article introduces Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models, which enhance the personalization of pre-trained diffusion models by allowing fine-tuning through optimized weight matrices. These models enable tailored content generation across various areas, eliminating the need for extensive retraining. Despite the wealth of LoRA adapters available, users encounter difficulties in selecting suitable ones due to the lack of organization. The study addresses this challenge by presenting a novel submodular framework, treating adapter selection as a combinatorial optimization matter. Quantitative and qualitative assessments confirm the framework's ability to produce diverse outputs spanning multiple domains. <div>
arXiv:2510.15022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models have revolutionized the personalization of pre-trained diffusion models by enabling fine-tuning through low-rank, factorized weight matrices specifically optimized for attention layers. These models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume, diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide range of domains.

Summary: <br>
The article introduces MOBIUS, a family of efficient foundation models for universal instance segmentation. It addresses the limitation of high computational cost in deploying large-scale models on resource-constrained platforms. MOBIUS achieves Pareto-optimal downscaling for deployment across a wide range of devices. It includes a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale and multi-modal fusion, a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for adaptive decoder pruning, and a streamlined training strategy. These innovations reduce pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs significantly while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in a third of the training iterations. MOBIUS sets a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices. <div>

Abstract: Scaling up model size and training data has advanced foundation models for instance-level perception, achieving state-of-the-art in-domain and zero-shot performance across object detection and segmentation. However, their high computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy. Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively, while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.

Summary:<br>
This study introduces COGS, a data-efficient framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of pretrained multi-modal large language models in artificial image domains. By decomposing seed questions into perception and reasoning factors and systematically generating synthetic question-answer pairs, COGS enables significant improvements in performance on unseen questions, particularly those requiring advanced reasoning skills. Training with a mixture of different seed data enhances transferability across multiple datasets, indicating that COGS fosters generalizable capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in chart reasoning tasks, with promising applications across various domains such as webpages. <div>
arXiv:2510.15040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents, and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains such as webpages.

Summary:
GDGen is a framework that integrates various types of dynamics, including rigid body, articulated body, and soft body dynamics, into a unified system using a potential energy perspective. By treating the world as a single entity and focusing on minimizing potential energy in physical systems, GDGen can infer underlying physical properties from motion observations. The framework extends elastodynamics by introducing directional stiffness to cover a wide range of physical behaviors. A specialized network is used to model material properties, and a neural field represents deformation in a geometry-agnostic manner. Through extensive experiments, GDGen proves to be a versatile tool for creating interactive virtual environments and training robotic agents in complex and dynamic scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Digital twin worlds with realistic interactive dynamics presents a new opportunity to develop generalist embodied agents in scannable environments with complex physical behaviors. To this end, we present GDGen (Generalized Representation for Generalized Dynamics Generation), a framework that takes a potential energy perspective to seamlessly integrate rigid body, articulated body, and soft body dynamics into a unified, geometry-agnostic system. GDGen operates from the governing principle that the potential energy for any stable physical system should be low. This fresh perspective allows us to treat the world as one holistic entity and infer underlying physical properties from simple motion observations. We extend classic elastodynamics by introducing directional stiffness to capture a broad spectrum of physical behaviors, covering soft elastic, articulated, and rigid body systems. We propose a specialized network to model the extended material property and employ a neural field to represent deformation in a geometry-agnostic manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GDGen robustly unifies diverse simulation paradigms, offering a versatile foundation for creating interactive virtual environments and training robotic agents in complex, dynamically rich scenarios.

<div> Keywords: Vision-language pre-training, 3D medical imaging, Report generation, Classification probing, Zero-shot classification

Summary:
The paper introduces a new method called Comprehensive Language-image Pre-training (COLIPRI) to address the data limitations in 3D medical imaging for vision-language pre-training. By incorporating a report generation objective and pairing vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training, COLIPRI leverages both image-only and paired image-text datasets to increase data exposure. The COLIPRI encoder family developed through this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in report generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification tasks, while remaining competitive in semantic segmentation. This methodology enhances the capabilities of vision-language encoders (VLEs) in supporting radiologists by retrieving patients with similar abnormalities and predicting likelihoods of abnormality in 3D medical images. <div>
arXiv:2510.15042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language pre-training, i.e., aligning images with paired text, is a powerful paradigm to create encoders that can be directly used for tasks such as classification and retrieval, and for downstream tasks such as segmentation and report generation. In the 3D medical image domain, these capabilities allow vision-language encoders (VLEs) to support radiologists by retrieving patients with similar abnormalities or predicting likelihoods of abnormality. While the methodology holds promise, data availability limits the capabilities of current 3D VLEs.
  In this paper, we alleviate the lack of data by injecting additional inductive biases: introducing a report generation objective and pairing vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training. This allows us to leverage both image-only and paired image-text 3D datasets, increasing the total amount of data to which our model is exposed. Through these additional inductive biases, paired with best practices of the 3D medical imaging domain, we develop the Comprehensive Language-image Pre-training (COLIPRI) encoder family. Our COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification, and remain competitive for semantic segmentation.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal large language models, reasoning ability, model merging, DRIFT MLLMs, fine-tuning.

Summary: 
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are advancing quickly, but their reasoning ability lags compared to text-only models. Existing methods for improving reasoning in MLLMs are resource-intensive, leading researchers to explore model merging as an alternative. However, naive merging is not always effective across all model families. To address this issue, Directional Reasoning Injection for Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs were proposed. DRIFT transfers reasoning knowledge in the gradient space, preserving multimodal alignment. By precomputing a reasoning prior and using it to bias gradients during fine-tuning, DRIFT enhances reasoning performance while reducing the computational cost. Experimental results on benchmarks such as MathVista and MathVerse show that DRIFT outperforms naive merging and supervised fine-tuning methods, offering an efficient and effective way to improve reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their reasoning ability often lags behind that of strong text-only counterparts. Existing methods to bridge this gap rely on supervised fine-tuning over large-scale multimodal reasoning data or reinforcement learning, both of which are resource-intensive. A promising alternative is model merging, which interpolates parameters between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal variants. However, our analysis shows that naive merging is not always a "free lunch": its effectiveness varies drastically across model families, with some (e.g., LLaVA, Idefics) benefiting while others (e.g., Qwen) suffer performance degradation. To address this, we propose Directional Reasoning Injection for Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs, a lightweight method that transfers reasoning knowledge in the gradient space, without destabilizing multimodal alignment. DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during multimodal fine-tuning. This approach preserves the simplicity of standard supervised fine-tuning pipelines while enabling efficient reasoning transfer. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista and MathVerse, demonstrate that DRIFT consistently improves reasoning performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, while matching or surpassing training-heavy methods at a fraction of the cost.

<div> Keywords: young children, visual object recognition, category learning, generalization, infant experience. 

Summary: 
Young children can readily recognize and generalize visual objects labeled by common nouns, indicating the existence of basic level object categories. However, the origins of these categories remain unclear. The authors propose that the answer lies in the statistics of infants' daily visual experiences, which consist of a lumpy similarity structure. This structure includes clusters of highly similar images interspersed with rarer, more variable ones across eight early-learned categories. By analyzing egocentric images from 14 infants, aged 7 to 11 months, the researchers demonstrate that mimicking this structure in machines improves generalization from small datasets in machine learning. The natural lumpiness of infant experience may support early category learning and generalization while also offering principles for efficient learning across various problems and types of learners.

Yet if they are, how they arise remains unclear. We propose that the answer lies in the statistics of infant daily life visual experiences. Whereas large and diverse datasets typically support robust learning and generalization in human and machine learning, infants achieve this generalization from limited experiences. We suggest that the resolution of this apparent contradiction lies in the visual diversity of daily life, repeated experiences with single object instances. Analyzing egocentric images from 14 infants (aged 7 to 11 months) we show that their everyday visual input exhibits a lumpy similarity structure, with clusters of highly similar images interspersed with rarer, more variable ones, across eight early-learned categories. Computational experiments show that mimicking this structure in machines improves generalization from small datasets in machine learning. The natural lumpiness of infant experience may thus support early category learning and generalization and, more broadly, offer principles for efficient learning across a variety of problems and kinds of learners.

<div> Keywords: 3D Gaussian Splatting, online reconstruction, redundancy removal, 3D Point Transformer, generalizable 3D reconstruction

Summary: 
SaLon3R is a novel framework for online 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstruction that can handle over 50 views at over 10 FPS while removing 50% to 90% of redundancies. It introduces compact anchor primitives for redundancy removal through saliency-aware Gaussian quantization and utilizes a 3D Point Transformer to refine anchor attributes for resolving geometric and photometric inconsistencies across frames. By leveraging a 3D reconstruction backbone and saliency map, the method compresses redundant Gaussians into compact anchors based on the complexity of regions. The 3D Point Transformer learns spatial structural priors to refine anchor attributes and saliency, improving geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization, the approach effectively prunes redundant 3DGS in a single pass. Experimental results show superior performance in novel view synthesis and depth estimation, showcasing efficiency, robustness, and generalization for long-term 3D reconstruction. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled generalizable, on-the-fly reconstruction of sequential input views. However, existing methods often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction. To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90% redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization, our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation, demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction.

<div> Keywords: text-to-video generation, trajectory, text descriptions, video generation, motion control

Summary:
Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT) is a new framework for text-to-video generation that enhances control over subject composition in generated scenes. The framework utilizes trajectories paired with localized text descriptions, allowing for precise control over appearance and motion in video generation. The Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) mechanism integrates trajectory and text signals, while a dual-CFG scheme separately modulates local and global text guidance. A data processing pipeline produces trajectories annotated with localized descriptions of tracked entities, enabling TGT to achieve higher visual quality and improved motion controllability compared to existing methods. The framework is trained on two million annotated video clips, demonstrating superior visual quality, accurate text alignment, and enhanced motion control.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly in visual fidelity, whereas standard methods still have limited ability to control the subject composition of generated scenes. Prior work shows that adding localized text control signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings, offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles, pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion. Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with prior approaches.

Summary: <br>
Diffusion models are being used as priors for solving various medical imaging inverse problems, combining data-driven models with domain knowledge in neuroimaging. This approach utilizes a score-based diffusion prior trained on diverse brain MRI data, along with flexible forward models for tasks like super-resolution and bias field correction. The framework is shown to refine outputs from deep learning methods for improved anatomical fidelity. Results on a range of MRI data demonstrate state-of-the-art performance without the need for paired training datasets. The study highlights the potential of diffusion priors as versatile tools for analyzing brain MRI scans. <br> <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution, bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.

Summary: <br>
The article introduces Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL) for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. FFT-MIL combines Multiple Instance Learning with a frequency-domain branch to capture global dependencies in WSIs. Low-frequency crops are extracted using Fast Fourier Transform and processed through an FFT-Block to integrate global context. The FFT-Block improves macro F1 scores and AUC on public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of frequency-domain learning in capturing global dependencies. FFT-MIL enhances the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology by complementing spatial features with global frequency features. <div>
arXiv:2510.15138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures essential for robust diagnostic prediction.
  We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling compatibility with diverse MIL architectures.
  FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1 scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.

Summary:
The article introduces XModBench, a benchmark designed to measure cross-modal consistency in omni-modal large language models (OLLMs). It comprises multiple-choice questions across five task families to assess modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparities, and directional imbalance in OLLMs. The experiments on the model Gemini 2.5 Pro reveal challenges in spatial and temporal reasoning, persistent modality disparities with lower performance in audio compared to text, and directional imbalance with lower consistency in vision context than text. These findings highlight the current limitations in achieving modality-invariant reasoning in OLLMs and emphasize the importance of XModBench as a diagnostic tool for evaluating and enhancing cross-modal competence.<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.15148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828 multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than 60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.

Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to the community for reproduction and further development.

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a critical challenge in foundation model training for histopathology, often hindered by software randomness, hardware non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting. To investigate these issues, we trained a CLIP model on the QUILT-1M dataset and systematically evaluated the impact of different hyperparameter settings and augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets (PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, and LC25000-Colon). Despite variability across runs, we identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8 outperformed more aggressive (0.6) or conservative (0.9) settings, distributed training without local loss improved stability, and learning rates below 5.0e-5 consistently degraded performance across all datasets. The LC25000 (Colon) dataset consistently provided the most reproducible benchmark. These findings highlight that reproducibility in computational pathology depends not only on transparent documentation but also on carefully chosen experimental configurations, and we provide practical rules to guide future efforts in developing reproducible foundation models for digital pathology.

By generating images that preserve class-discriminative features while introducing controlled variations, our approach improves dataset diversity, leading to superior performance on fine-grained vision datasets.

arXiv:2510.15194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent generative data augmentation methods conditioned on both image and text prompts struggle to balance between fidelity and diversity, as it is challenging to preserve essential image details while aligning with varied text prompts. This challenge arises because representations in the synthesis process often become entangled with non-essential input image attributes such as environmental contexts, creating conflicts with text prompts intended to modify these elements. To address this, we propose a personalized image generation framework that uses a salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce the influence of irrelevant visual details during the synthesis process, thereby maintaining intuitive alignment between image and text inputs. By generating images that better preserve class-discriminative features with additional controlled variations, our framework effectively enhances the diversity of training datasets and thereby improves the robustness of downstream models. Our approach demonstrates superior performance across eight fine-grained vision datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art augmentation methods with averaged classification accuracy improvements by 0.73% and 6.5% under conventional and long-tail settings, respectively.

Abstract: Prenatal diagnosis of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) holds great potential for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. However, collecting high-quality diagnostic data remains difficult due to the rarity of these conditions, resulting in imbalanced and low-quality datasets that hinder model performance. Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple sources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the ability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with Diagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first publicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and echocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD detection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture that incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations from image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image and tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score of 79.8 $\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset. We will publicly release our dataset and code to encourage further research on this unexplored field.

Abstract: We present DriveGen3D, a novel framework for generating high-quality and highly controllable dynamic 3D driving scenes that addresses critical limitations in existing methodologies. Current approaches to driving scene synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D representation, or restrict themselves to static single-scene reconstruction. Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through multimodal conditional control. DriveGen3D introduces a unified pipeline consisting of two specialized components: FastDrive-DiT, an efficient video diffusion transformer for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis under text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layout guidance; and FastRecon3D, a feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian representations across time, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency. Together, these components enable real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to $424\times800$ at 12 FPS) and corresponding dynamic 3D scenes, achieving SSIM of 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis, all while maintaining parameter efficiency.

Summary: 
MRI is essential for diagnosing brain pathologies, but automated analysis tools struggle with large lesions like tumors.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality used in the diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning for brain pathologies. However, most automated MRI analysis tools, such as segmentation and registration pipelines, are optimized for healthy anatomies and often fail when confronted with large lesions such as tumors. To overcome this, image inpainting techniques aim to locally synthesize healthy brain tissues in tumor regions, enabling the reliable application of general-purpose tools. In this work, we systematically evaluate state-of-the-art inpainting models and observe a saturation in their standalone performance. In response, we introduce a methodology combining model ensembling with efficient post-processing strategies such as median filtering, histogram matching, and pixel averaging. Further anatomical refinement is achieved via a lightweight U-Net enhancement stage. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed pipeline improves the anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions, yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline models. By combining established models with targeted post-processing, we achieve improved and more accessible inpainting outcomes, supporting broader clinical deployment and sustainable, resource-conscious research.

Summary: Recognizability is a crucial factor in human face processing and significantly impacts face recognition system performance. Current methods in deep face recognition suffer from limitations in capturing recognizability and optimizing feature representation. Introducing Quality Control Face (QCFace), a hard-margin strategy, helps overcome overlapping gradient issues and enables clear separation of recognizability from identity representation. The novel hard-margin-based loss function in QCFace incorporates a guidance factor for hypersphere planning, leading to improved recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Experimental results demonstrate that QCFace achieves superior performance in verification and identification tasks compared to existing recognizability-based losses. <div>

Abstract: Recognizability, a key perceptual factor in human face processing, strongly affects the performance of face recognition (FR) systems in both verification and identification tasks. Effectively using recognizability to enhance feature representation remains challenging. In deep FR, the loss function plays a crucial role in shaping how features are embedded. However, current methods have two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through soft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower discrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual overlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce undesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion in hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled representations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated. To address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control Face (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and enables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation. Based on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a guidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Extensive experiments confirm that QCFace not only provides robust and quantifiable recognizability encoding but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in both verification and identification benchmarks compared to existing recognizability-based losses.

Summary: <br>
The article introduces a hyperbolic classification framework for Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) where each training sample has only one positive label. The framework represents labels as hyperbolic balls, enabling the modeling of rich inter-label relationships. This approach captures multiple relationship types simultaneously, including inclusion for hierarchical structures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic independence. The framework includes a temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a double-well regularization for meaningful configurations. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show competitive performance and interpretability compared to existing methods. Statistical analysis confirms the strong correlation between learned embeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic geometry as a robust paradigm for structured classification under incomplete supervision. <br> <div>

Abstract: Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) addresses the challenging scenario where each training sample is annotated with only one positive label despite potentially belonging to multiple categories, making it difficult to capture complex label relationships and hierarchical structures. While existing methods implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity, lacking explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types. To address these limitations, we propose the first hyperbolic classification framework for SPMLL that represents each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than a point or vector, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through geometric ball interactions. Our ball-based approach naturally captures multiple relationship types simultaneously: inclusion for hierarchical structures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic independence. Further, we introduce two key component innovations: a temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired double-well regularization that guides balls toward meaningful configurations. To validate our approach, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive performance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods. Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals strong correlation between learned embeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic geometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under incomplete supervision.

Summary: 
The article introduces SVG, a novel latent diffusion model for visual generation that does not rely on variational autoencoders. By leveraging self-supervised representations, SVG creates a feature space with clear semantic discriminability, allowing for more efficient training of diffusion models. This approach accelerates training, supports few-step sampling, and improves generative quality. SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of self-supervised representations, offering a pathway to task-general, high-quality visual representations. This model addresses limitations of VAE+diffusion paradigms by enhancing semantic separation and discriminative structure in the latent space, ultimately leading to better performance in various vision tasks. <div>

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features, while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

Summary: 
Structured pruning of Large Language Models has limitations such as performance degradation, inefficient weight layer aggregation, and lack of post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these issues, the CoMe framework is proposed. CoMe incorporates a progressive layer pruning approach using Concatenation-based Merging to fuse critical channels across layers, achieving gradual model size reduction. Additionally, a channel sensitivity metric is introduced to facilitate fine-grained channel selection. A hierarchical distillation post-training process leverages original and pruned model layer correspondences for effective knowledge transfer. Experimental results on seven benchmarks demonstrate that CoMe outperforms existing methods, retaining 83% of the original accuracy while pruning 30% of parameters in LLaMA-2-7b. The CoMe code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/MPI-Lab/CoMe.

Abstract: Large Language Models excel at natural language processing tasks, but their massive size leads to high computational and storage demands. Recent works have sought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning. However, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In this work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key limitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2) incompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose CoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a Concatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation post-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric that utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel selection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method to fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive model size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol that leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers established during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer. Experiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model retains 83% of its original average accuracy.

The paper introduces Proto-Former, a unified facial landmark detection framework that addresses the limitations of single-dataset training by enabling joint training across multiple datasets. The framework consists of an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) for feature extraction and learning prototype representations, and a Progressive Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) for refining prototypes to guide attention to key facial regions. A Prototype-Aware (PA) loss function is introduced to optimize path finding by constraining selection weights of prototype experts, resolving instability and gradient conflicts during multi-dataset training.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved facial landmark detection. However, existing facial landmark detection datasets often define different numbers of landmarks, and most mainstream methods can only be trained on a single dataset. This limits the model generalization to different datasets and hinders the development of a unified model. To address this issue, we propose Proto-Former, a unified, adaptive, end-to-end facial landmark detection framework that explicitly enhances dataset-specific facial structural representations (i.e., prototype). Proto-Former overcomes the limitations of single-dataset training by enabling joint training across multiple datasets within a unified architecture. Specifically, Proto-Former comprises two key components: an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) that performs adaptive feature extraction and learns prototype representations, and a Progressive Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) that refines these prototypes to generate prompts that guide the model's attention to key facial regions. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Prototype-Aware (PA) loss, which achieves optimal path finding by constraining the selection weights of prototype experts. This loss function effectively resolves the problem of prototype expert addressing instability during multi-dataset training, alleviates gradient conflicts, and enables the extraction of more accurate facial structure features. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Proto-Former achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Summary:
SHARE introduces a new technique for accurately placing humans in 3D space by leveraging scene geometry cues. The method utilizes a monocular RGB video from a stationary camera to estimate human meshes and segmentation masks, as well as scene point maps at keyframes. By comparing the human mesh against the human point map extracted from the scene, SHARE iteratively refines the human's positions at keyframes and ensures consistency of non-keyframe human meshes. This approach improves 3D human placement accuracy while reconstructing the surrounding scene, making it suitable for gaming, AR/VR, and robotics applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHARE surpasses existing methods in both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos. <div>

Abstract: Animating realistic character interactions with the surrounding environment is important for autonomous agents in gaming, AR/VR, and robotics. However, current methods for human motion reconstruction struggle with accurately placing humans in 3D space. We introduce Scene-Human Aligned REconstruction (SHARE), a technique that leverages the scene geometry's inherent spatial cues to accurately ground human motion reconstruction. Each reconstruction relies solely on a monocular RGB video from a stationary camera. SHARE first estimates a human mesh and segmentation mask for every frame, alongside a scene point map at keyframes. It iteratively refines the human's positions at these keyframes by comparing the human mesh against the human point map extracted from the scene using the mask. Crucially, we also ensure that non-keyframe human meshes remain consistent by preserving their relative root joint positions to keyframe root joints during optimization. Our approach enables more accurate 3D human placement while reconstructing the surrounding scene, facilitating use cases on both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SHARE outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of both EEG and ECoG signals.

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery can benefit significantly from automated surgical tool detection, enabling advanced analysis and assistance. However, the limited availability of annotated data in surgical settings poses a challenge for training robust deep learning models. This paper introduces a novel staged adaptive fine-tuning approach consisting of two steps: a linear probing stage to condition additional classification layers on a pre-trained CNN-based architecture and a gradual freezing stage to dynamically reduce the fine-tunable layers, aiming to regulate adaptation to the surgical domain. This strategy reduces network complexity and improves efficiency, requiring only a single training loop and eliminating the need for multiple iterations. We validated our method on the Cholec80 dataset, employing CNN architectures (ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121) pre-trained on ImageNet for detecting surgical tools in cholecystectomy endoscopic videos. Our results demonstrate that our method improves detection performance compared to existing approaches and established fine-tuning techniques, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of 96.4%. To assess its broader applicability, the generalizability of the fine-tuning strategy was further confirmed on the CATARACTS dataset, a distinct domain of minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery. These findings suggest that gradual freezing fine-tuning is a promising technique for improving tool presence detection in diverse surgical procedures and may have broader applications in general image classification tasks.

The paper introduces Frequency-aware Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) for accurate 3D object detection from multi-view 2D images in autonomous driving scenarios. The method addresses challenges such as depth prediction quality, object boundary discontinuity, and small object indistinction by incorporating spatial information into 2D image features. It includes three main modules: Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder (FSPE) for feature pyramid construction, Cross-view Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) for pixel-level depth distribution estimation, and Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) for generating 3D depth-aware features. Hybrid depth supervision is used for comprehensive depth learning. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach. <div>
arXiv:2510.15385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder (FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism. Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and 3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.

Summary:
PFGS is a pose-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting framework designed to reconstruct complete objects from multi-pose image captures efficiently. It addresses the issue of incomplete reconstructions due to occluded or self-occluded regions by iteratively fusing auxiliary poses into a unified 3D model of the main pose. The fusion strategy combines global and local registration for effective merging of views and refinement of the 3D model. PFGS intelligently incorporates recent advances in 3D foundation models to improve registration accuracy while addressing memory demands and background inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3D models. <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-quality, real-time novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, most existing methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures. Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy. PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

Summary: 
LILAC presents a novel approach for generating long and stylized human motions in real time, crucial for responsive character control applications. Unlike existing methods that work in raw motion space leading to high computational costs, LILAC uses a latent-space VAE-Diffusion framework, ensuring high-quality stylization without offline processing. The architecture, LILAC, extends the framework to enable online stylization through a latent-space streaming design with causal decoding and motion feature injection for smooth transitions. This design allows for long-sequence real-time stylization without the need for future frames or modifications to the diffusion model architecture. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the balance achieved between stylization quality and responsiveness, making LILAC a promising approach for continuous and responsive character motion control applications. Supplementary video and examples are available on the project page. <br> <div>

Abstract: Generating long and stylized human motions in real time is critical for applications that demand continuous and responsive character control. Despite its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments on benchmark datasets.

<div> benchmark, underwater instance segmentation, open-vocabulary, geometric prior enhancement module, semantic alignment injection mechanism

Summary:
MARIS introduces a new benchmark, focusing on underwater instance segmentation with an open-vocabulary approach. Existing methods are limited by close-vocabulary prediction, hindering recognition of new marine categories. The proposed framework, comprising the Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (GPEM) and the Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (SAIM), addresses visual degradation and semantic misalignment in underwater scenes. GPEM uses stable part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency. SAIM enriches language embeddings with domain-specific information to improve recognition of unseen categories. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance of the framework in both in-domain and cross-domain settings on the MARIS benchmark. This research lays a solid foundation for future advancements in underwater perception research.

Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS} (\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance \underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components. The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM}) enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future underwater perception research.

Summary: 
LoSP-Prompt is a new reconstruction framework designed to address motion-induced phase artifacts in multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI). By incorporating physics-informed modeling and synthetic-data-driven prompt learning, the algorithm effectively overcomes challenges related to motion artifacts in body-wide tumor diagnostics. It achieves twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing lesion detection in the liver. The algorithm is scanner-agnostic and generalizes well across diverse anatomical regions, outperforming existing methods in image quality, artifact suppression, and noise reduction. Validation on clinical images showed significant improvements in radiologists' evaluations, particularly in kidney, liver, sacroiliac, spinal cord, knee, and brain DWI. LoSP-Prompt eliminates the need for navigator signals and offers a robust solution for high-resolution multi-organ imaging, holding transformative potential for precision oncology.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (multi-shot DWI) for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration, peristalsis, and so on, compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+ clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1) Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions (liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points (good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points (good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving efficiency.

Summary: 
The study introduces Semantic4Safety, a framework that utilizes zero-shot semantic segmentation on street-view imagery to derive 11 informative streetscape indicators for analyzing traffic accidents. By integrating road type as contextual information and employing machine learning techniques such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), the framework uncovers heterogeneous causal patterns across different accident types. The results highlight the importance of features related to scene complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry in predicting accident risk. Additionally, the study finds that larger drivable area and emergency space can reduce risk, while excessive visual openness may increase it. Through Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimation, the framework enables controlled assessments of causal impacts, providing valuable insights for targeted interventions and high-risk corridor diagnosis in urban road safety planning.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Street-view imagery (SVI) offers a fine-grained lens on traffic risk, yet two fundamental challenges persist: (1) how to construct street-level indicators that capture accident-related features, and (2) how to quantify their causal impacts across different accident types. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000 accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual openness can increase it. By bridging predictive modeling with causal inference, Semantic4Safety supports targeted interventions and high-risk corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road safety planning.

Summary: <br>
The article introduces the Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, which boosts deep learning efficiency in data-scarce areas like medical imaging. PCMambaNet, a new network, combines the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) and Corrective Residual Network (CRN). PPM predicts diagnostically important areas using anatomical knowledge, while CRN refines these regions for precise segmentation. The model outperforms traditional end-to-end networks by converging in only 1-5 epochs. By incorporating domain knowledge to simplify learning tasks, PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, overcoming data inefficiency and overfitting. This novel approach demonstrates the potential for significant acceleration and improvement in challenging medical imaging applications. <br> <div>

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the end-to-end paradigm in deep learning, it often suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large-scale datasets, which fundamentally limits its efficiency and applicability in data-scarce domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we introduce the Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling task to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we propose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two synergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a coarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search space. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge-bilateral symmetry-to predict a 'focus map' of diagnostically relevant asymmetric regions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the residual error, focusing the network's full capacity on refining these challenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive experiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1-5 epochs-a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This dramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain knowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates data inefficiency and overfitting.

<div> reinforcement learning, video reasoning, evidence prioritization, temporal information supplementation, state-of-the-art <br>
Summary:<br>
The article introduces a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive framework for video large language models to enhance long-form video reasoning. The framework, called evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL), enables dynamic selection of relevant frames and localized re-sampling for finer temporal detail access. By actively interrogating evidence, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance in five challenging video reasoning benchmarks. The EARL-trained model outperforms existing models in terms of evidence purity and effectiveness, achieving impressive scores on LongVideoBench, MVBench, and VideoMME. This emphasizes the significance of prioritizing evidence purity and showcases the success of the proposed framework in improving video reasoning capabilities through rigorous reward mechanisms and temporal information supplementation. <div>
arXiv:2510.15440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework, which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and, crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our 7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence purity and the effectiveness of our framework.

<br>
Summary: <br>
Recognizing the motion of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is crucial for autonomous aerial swarms. Traditional vision-based models using RGB data alone struggle to capture complex MAV motion. The proposed MAVR-Net framework utilizes multi-view learning, combining RGB frames, optical flow, and segmentation masks for improved recognition accuracy. ResNet-based encoders extract features from each view, while a multi-scale feature pyramid preserves spatiotemporal details. A cross-view attention module enhances interaction between views, and a multi-view alignment loss ensures semantic consistency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance, with accuracy rates of 97.8%, 96.5%, and 92.8% on Short, Medium, and Long MAV datasets, respectively. <div>

Abstract: Recognizing the motion of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is crucial for enabling cooperative perception and control in autonomous aerial swarms. Yet, vision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture the complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their ability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper presents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition framework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach combines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical flow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV motion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract discriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is adopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To enhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module is introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature scales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic consistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations. Experimental results on benchmark MAV action datasets show that our method clearly outperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8\%, 96.5\%, and 92.8\% accuracy on the Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets, respectively.

Summary:
DPTrack is a new prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios. It addresses the limitations of existing trackers by incorporating fine-grained cues into directional kernels to generate precise prompts. The tracker hierarchically captures an object's topological structure and leverages topological attributes to enrich feature representation. An encoder condenses these features into directional kernels, serving as guidance signals that encapsulate attribute cues. A kernel-guided prompt module propagates the kernel across the search region to pinpoint target features and convert them into precise prompts, incorporating spatial gating for robust nighttime tracking. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate DPTrack's superior performance in comparison to existing trackers. The code will be made available on GitHub for further research and development.

Abstract: Existing nighttime aerial trackers based on prompt learning rely solely on spatial localization supervision, which fails to provide fine-grained cues that point to target features and inevitably produces vague prompts. This limitation impairs the tracker's ability to accurately focus on the object features and results in trackers still performing poorly. To address this issue, we propose DPTrack, a prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios by encoding the given object's attribute features into the directional kernel enriched with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts. Specifically, drawing inspiration from visual bionics, DPTrack first hierarchically captures the object's topological structure, leveraging topological attributes to enrich the feature representation. Subsequently, an encoder condenses these topology-aware features into the directional kernel, which serves as the core guidance signal that explicitly encapsulates the object's fine-grained attribute cues. Finally, a kernel-guided prompt module built on channel-category correspondence attributes propagates the kernel across the features of the search region to pinpoint the positions of target features and convert them into precise prompts, integrating spatial gating for robust nighttime tracking. Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate DPTrack's superior performance. Our code will be available at https://github.com/zzq-vipsl/DPTrack.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel phase-aware temporal augmentation method for enhancing micro-expression recognition (MER) using deep learning techniques. The method focuses on decomposing expression sequences into onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset phases to generate separate dynamic images (DI), thereby enriching motion diversity. By incorporating these phase-specific representations, the proposed Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy improves recognition accuracy, F1-score, and average recall on CASME-II and SAMM datasets across various deep architectures. The approach is model-agnostic, simple, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising direction for robust and generalizable MER. When combined with spatial augmentations, the method achieves up to a 10% relative improvement, underscoring its potential to address class imbalances in MER applications. <div>

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal genuine emotions, typically lasting less than half a second. Recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in micro-expression recognition (MER), its effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of annotated ME datasets. This data limitation not only hinders generalization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured during training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial augmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation strategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap, this paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic image. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset dynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two motion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset. A separate DI is generated for each phase, forming a Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy. These phase-specific representations enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal cues that are crucial for recognizing subtle facial transitions. Extensive experiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures, including CNNs, Vision Transformer, and the lightweight LEARNet, demonstrate consistent performance improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted F1-score, and unweighted average recall, which are crucial for addressing class imbalance in MER. When combined with spatial augmentations, our method achieves up to a 10\% relative improvement. The proposed augmentation is simple, model-agnostic, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising direction for robust and generalizable MER.

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) estimates camera poses and reconstructs point clouds, forming a foundation for various tasks. However, applying SfM to driving scenes captured by multi-camera systems presents significant difficulties, including unreliable pose estimation, excessive outliers in road surface reconstruction, and low reconstruction efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-camera Reconstruction and Aggregation Structure-from-Motion (MRASfM) framework specifically designed for driving scenes. MRASfM enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation by leveraging the fixed spatial relationships within the multi-camera system during the registration process. To improve the quality of road surface reconstruction, our framework employs a plane model to effectively remove erroneous points from the triangulated road surface. Moreover, treating the multi-camera set as a single unit in Bundle Adjustment (BA) helps reduce optimization variables to boost efficiency. In addition, MRASfM achieves multi-scene aggregation through scene association and assembly modules in a coarse-to-fine fashion. We deployed multi-camera systems on actual vehicles to validate the generalizability of MRASfM across various scenes and its robustness in challenging conditions through real-world applications. Furthermore, large-scale validation results on public datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of MRASfM, achieving 0.124 absolute pose error on the nuScenes dataset.

Summary: 
Drone technology has led to a rapid increase in video data, necessitating efficient semantic retrieval methods. This study introduces the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR) task, focusing on the unique characteristics of drone videos such as overhead perspectives and diverse semantic expressions. A novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM) is proposed, which employs a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism to extract rich semantic information from specific scene regions in drone videos. MSAM incorporates an adaptive semantic construction module, distribution-driven semantic learning term, and diversity semantic term to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities. A cross-modal interactive feature fusion pooling mechanism is introduced to reduce background interference in drone videos. Experimental results demonstrate that MSAM outperforms existing methods in the drone video-text retrieval task. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.

Abstract: With the advancement of drone technology, the volume of video data increases rapidly, creating an urgent need for efficient semantic retrieval. We are the first to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR) task. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural homogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which challenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in effectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval mechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM introduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates dynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from specific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning of drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between words and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction module, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic term to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and improve the robustness of feature representation. To reduce the interference of complex backgrounds in drone videos, we introduce a cross-modal interactive feature fusion pooling mechanism that focuses on feature extraction and matching in target regions, minimizing noise effects. Extensive experiments on two self-constructed drone video-text datasets show that MSAM outperforms other existing methods in the drone video-text retrieval task. The source code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Abstract: 3D phenotyping of plants plays a crucial role for understanding plant growth, yield prediction, and disease control. We present a pipeline capable of generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of individual agricultural plants. To acquire data, a small commercially available UAV captures images of a selected plant. Apart from placing ArUco markers, the entire image acquisition process is fully autonomous, controlled by a self-developed Android application running on the drone's controller. The reconstruction task is particularly challenging due to environmental wind and downwash of the UAV. Our proposed pipeline supports the integration of arbitrary state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction methods. To mitigate errors caused by leaf motion during image capture, we use an iterative method that gradually adjusts the input images through deformation. Motion is estimated using optical flow between the original input images and intermediate 3D reconstructions rendered from the corresponding viewpoints. This alignment gradually reduces scene motion, resulting in a canonical representation. After a few iterations, our pipeline improves the reconstruction of state-of-the-art methods and enables the extraction of high-resolution 3D meshes. We will publicly release the source code of our reconstruction pipeline. Additionally, we provide a dataset consisting of multiple plants from various crops, captured across different points in time.

<title>Rethinking Efficient Hierarchical Mixing Architecture for Low-light RAW Image Enhancement</title>

Abstract: Low-light RAW image enhancement remains a challenging task. Although numerous deep learning based approaches have been proposed, they still suffer from inherent limitations. A key challenge is how to simultaneously achieve strong enhancement quality and high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the architecture for efficient low-light image signal processing (ISP) and introduce a Hierarchical Mixing Architecture (HiMA). HiMA leverages the complementary strengths of Transformer and Mamba modules to handle features at large and small scales, respectively, thereby improving efficiency while avoiding the ambiguities observed in prior two-stage frameworks. To further address uneven illumination with strong local variations, we propose Local Distribution Adjustment (LoDA), which adaptively aligns feature distributions across different local regions. In addition, to fully exploit the denoised outputs from the first stage, we design a Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) module that integrates spatial and frequency-domain priors for detail enhancement. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance with fewer parameters. Code will be released at https://github.com/Cynicarlos/HiMA.

<title>Exploring Conditions for Diffusion models in Robotic Control</title>

Abstract: While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains - yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific, dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA, which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.

<title>Latent Feature Alignment: Discovering Biased and Interpretable Subpopulations in Face Recognition Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15520</link>

Abstract: Modern face recognition models achieve high overall accuracy but continue to exhibit systematic biases that disproportionately affect certain subpopulations. Conventional bias evaluation frameworks rely on labeled attributes to form subpopulations, which are expensive to obtain and limited to predefined categories. We introduce Latent Feature Alignment (LFA), an attribute-label-free algorithm that uses latent directions to identify subpopulations. This yields two main benefits over standard clustering: (i) semantically coherent grouping, where faces sharing common attributes are grouped together more reliably than by proximity-based methods, and (ii) discovery of interpretable directions, which correspond to semantic attributes such as age, ethnicity, or attire. Across four state-of-the-art recognition models (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW, CelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in intra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes. These results position LFA as a practical method for representation auditing of face recognition models, enabling practitioners to identify and interpret biased subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.

<title>Balanced Multi-Task Attention for Satellite Image Classification: A Systematic Approach to Achieving 97.23% Accuracy on EuroSAT Without Pre-Training</title>

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation of custom convolutional neural network architectures for satellite land use classification, achieving 97.23% test accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset without reliance on pre-trained models. Through three progressive architectural iterations (baseline: 94.30%, CBAM-enhanced: 95.98%, and balanced multi-task attention: 97.23%) we identify and address specific failure modes in satellite imagery classification. Our principal contribution is a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that combines Coordinate Attention for spatial feature extraction with Squeeze-Excitation blocks for spectral feature extraction, unified through a learnable fusion parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that this learnable parameter autonomously converges to alpha approximately 0.57, indicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities for satellite imagery. We employ progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20% by network depth) and class-balanced loss weighting to address overfitting and confusion pattern imbalance. The final 12-layer architecture achieves Cohen's Kappa of 0.9692 with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy, demonstrating confidence calibration with a 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect predictions. Our approach achieves performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned ResNet-50 (98.57%) while requiring no external data, validating the efficacy of systematic architectural design for domain-specific applications. Complete code, trained models, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.

<title>Diffusion Bridge Networks Simulate Clinical-grade PET from MRI for Dementia Diagnostics</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15556</link>

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an established tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected dementing disorders. However, compared to the routinely available magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), FDG-PET remains significantly less accessible and substantially more expensive. Here, we present SiM2P, a 3D diffusion bridge-based framework that learns a probabilistic mapping from MRI and auxiliary patient information to simulate FDG-PET images of diagnostic quality. In a blinded clinical reader study, two neuroradiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians rated the original MRI and SiM2P-simulated PET images of patients with Alzheimer's disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy controls. SiM2P significantly improved the overall diagnostic accuracy of differentiating between three groups from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Notably, the simulated PET images received higher diagnostic certainty ratings and achieved superior interrater agreement compared to the MRI images. Finally, we developed a practical workflow for local deployment of the SiM2P framework. It requires as few as 20 site-specific cases and only basic demographic information. This approach makes the established diagnostic benefits of FDG-PET imaging more accessible to patients with suspected dementing disorders, potentially improving early detection and differential diagnosis in resource-limited settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiiitong/SiM2P.

<title>ClapperText: A Benchmark for Text Recognition in Low-Resource Archival Documents</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15557</link>

arXiv:2510.15557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date, location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and 1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded, non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains, highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/linty5/ClapperText.

Abstract: Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/HiHiAllen/Imaginarium.

Abstract: DeepFake technology has advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the creation of highly realistic synthetic face images. Existing DeepFake detection methods often struggle with pose variations, occlusions, and artifacts that are difficult to detect in real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-view architecture that enhances DeepFake detection by analyzing facial features at multiple levels. Our approach integrates three specialized encoders, a global view encoder for detecting boundary inconsistencies, a middle view encoder for analyzing texture and color alignment, and a local view encoder for capturing distortions in expressive facial regions such as the eyes, nose, and mouth, where DeepFake artifacts frequently occur. Additionally, we incorporate a face orientation encoder, trained to classify face poses, ensuring robust detection across various viewing angles. By fusing features from these encoders, our model achieves superior performance in detecting manipulated images, even under challenging pose and lighting conditions.Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, outperforming conventional single-view approaches

Abstract: Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED), addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in microscopy workflows.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors. To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.

Abstract: Multimodal person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match pedestrian images across different modalities. However, most existing methods focus on limited cross-modal settings and fail to support arbitrary query-retrieval combinations, hindering practical deployment. We propose FlexiReID, a flexible framework that supports seven retrieval modes across four modalities: rgb, infrared, sketches, and text. FlexiReID introduces an adaptive mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically integrate diverse modality features and a cross-modal query fusion module to enhance multimodal feature extraction. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we construct CIRS-PEDES, a unified dataset extending four popular Re-ID datasets to include all four modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexiReID achieves state-of-the-art performance and offers strong generalization in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly localization is a rising field in computer vision research, with important progress in recent years. This work focuses on the problem of detecting and localizing anomalies in textures, where anomalies can be defined as the regions that deviate from the overall statistics, violating the stationarity assumption. The main limitation of existing methods is their high running time, making them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios, such as assembly line monitoring. We propose a real-time method, named QFCA, which implements a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis (FCA) algorithm. By carefully adapting the patch statistics comparison to work on histograms of quantized values, we obtain a 10x speedup with little to no loss in accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a feature preprocessing step based on principal component analysis, which enhances the contrast between normal and anomalous features, improving the detection precision on complex textures. Our method is thoroughly evaluated against prior art, comparing favorably with existing methods. Project page: https://reality.tf.fau.de/pub/ardelean2025quantized.html

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising techniques achieve impressive results, yet their real-world application is frequently constrained by substantial computational and memory demands, necessitating a compromise between inference speed and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present an ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for practical use.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a crucial and increasingly important task in remote sensing, aiming to transfer knowledge from a source domain a differently distributed target domain. It has broad applications across various real-world applications, including remote sensing element interpretation, ecological environment monitoring, and urban/rural planning. However, domain adaptation in remote sensing poses significant challenges due to differences in data, such as variations in ground sampling distance, imaging modes from various sensors, geographical landscapes, and environmental conditions. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature representation and cross-domain knowledge transfer, leading to widespread adoption in remote sensing tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of significant advancements in deep learning based domain adaptation for remote sensing. We first introduce the preliminary knowledge to clarify key concepts, mathematical notations, and the taxonomy of methodologies. We then organize existing algorithms from multiple perspectives, including task categorization, input mode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity, providing readers with a structured understanding of the field. Next, we review widely used datasets and summarize the performance of state-of-the-art methods to provide an overview of current progress. We also identify open challenges and potential directions to guide future research in domain adaptation for remote sensing. Compared to previous surveys, this work addresses a broader range of domain adaptation tasks in remote sensing, rather than concentrating on a few subfields. It also presents a systematic taxonomy, providing a more comprehensive and organized understanding of the field. As a whole, this survey can inspire the research community, foster understanding, and guide future work in the field.

Abstract: Automatic medical image segmentation is a fundamental step in computer-aided diagnosis, yet fully supervised approaches demand extensive pixel-level annotations that are costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this burden, we propose a weakly supervised segmentation framework that leverages only four extreme points as annotation. Specifically, bounding boxes derived from the extreme points are used as prompts for the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to generate reliable initial pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are progressively refined by an enhanced Feature-Guided Extreme Point Masking (FGEPM) algorithm, which incorporates Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimation to construct a unified gradient uncertainty cost map for boundary tracing. Furthermore, a dual-branch Uncertainty-aware Scale Consistency (USC) loss and a box alignment loss are introduced to ensure spatial consistency and precise boundary alignment during training. Extensive experiments on two public ultrasound datasets, BUSI and UNS, demonstrate that our method achieves performance comparable to, and even surpassing fully supervised counterparts while significantly reducing annotation cost. These results validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed weakly supervised framework for ultrasound image segmentation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel dataset aimed at detecting pedestrians' intentions as they approach an ego-vehicle. The dataset comprises synchronized multi-modal data, including fisheye camera feeds, lidar laser scans, ultrasonic sensor readings, and motion capture-based 3D body poses, collected across diverse real-world scenarios.

We release a portion of the dataset along with a comprehensive benchmark suite, featuring evaluation metrics for accuracy, efficiency, and scalability on embedded systems. By addressing real-world challenges such as sensor occlusions, dynamic environments, and hardware constraints, this dataset offers a unique resource for developing and evaluating state-of-the-art algorithms in pedestrian detection, 3D pose estimation and 4D trajectory and intention prediction. Additionally, we provide baseline performance metrics using custom neural network architectures and suggest future research directions to encourage the adoption and enhancement of the dataset. This work aims to serve as a foundation for researchers seeking to advance the capabilities of intelligent vehicles in near-field scenarios.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD, particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for neuro-oncological imaging.

<title>Unimedvl: Unifying Medical Multimodal Understanding And Generation Through Observation-Knowledge-Analysis</title>

Abstract: Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations, segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements across diverse medical vision-language tasks.

<title>DGME-T: Directional Grid Motion Encoding for Transformer-Based Historical Camera Movement Classification</title>

Abstract: Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary, high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise, missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72% to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small, carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in degraded film analysis.

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto, on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in instruction-based video editing.

<title>SEGA: A Stepwise Evolution Paradigm for Content-Aware Layout Generation with Design Prior</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15749</link>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the content-aware layout generation problem, which aims to automatically generate layouts that are harmonious with a given background image. Existing methods usually deal with this task with a single-step reasoning framework. The lack of a feedback-based self-correction mechanism leads to their failure rates significantly increasing when faced with complex element layout planning. To address this challenge, we introduce SEGA, a novel Stepwise Evolution Paradigm for Content-Aware Layout Generation. Inspired by the systematic mode of human thinking, SEGA employs a hierarchical reasoning framework with a coarse-to-fine strategy: first, a coarse-level module roughly estimates the layout planning results; then, another refining module performs fine-level reasoning regarding the coarse planning results. Furthermore, we incorporate layout design principles as prior knowledge into the model to enhance its layout planning ability. Besides, we present GenPoster-100K that is a new large-scale poster dataset with rich meta-information annotation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving the state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets.

<title>NDM: A Noise-driven Detection and Mitigation Framework against Implicit Sexual Intentions in Text-to-Image Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15752</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2510.15752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content, especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms, can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent, risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and resources are available at https://github.com/lorraine021/NDM.

<title>Semantic segmentation with coarse annotations</title>

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image. Training a segmentation model achieves best results using annotated images, where each pixel is annotated with the corresponding class. When obtaining fine annotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse annotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels around the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse annotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the alignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization method for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based upsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be SLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of the segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully convolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and PanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

<title>QSilk: Micrograin Stabilization and Adaptive Quantile Clipping for Detail-Friendly Latent Diffusion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

arXiv:2510.15761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present QSilk, a lightweight, always-on stabilization layer for latent diffusion that improves high-frequency fidelity while suppressing rare activation spikes. QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale, enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

<title>Towards more holistic interpretability: A lightweight disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model</title>

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by predicting human-understandable concepts as intermediate representations. However, existing CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited controllability, which restricts their practical value, directly damage the responsibility of strategy from concept-based methods. We propose a lightweight Disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual features into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By introducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method improves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more transparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse datasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy, outperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification performance. By grounding concepts in visual evidence, our method overcomes a fundamental limitation of prior models and enhances the reliability of interpretable AI.

Abstract: As image generative models continue to increase not only in their fidelity but also in their ubiquity the development of tools that leverage direct interaction with their internal mechanisms in an interpretable way has received little attention In this work we introduce a system that allows users to develop a better understanding of the model through interaction and experimentation By giving users the ability to replace activation functions of a generative network with parametric ones and a way to set the parameters of these functions we introduce an alternative approach to control the networks output We demonstrate the use of our method on StyleGAN2 and BigGAN networks trained on FFHQ and ImageNet respectively.

Abstract: The scale and quality of datasets are crucial for training robust perception models. However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions. However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data, achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone architectures, and data scales. Our code is available at https://github.com/haoweiz23/ReCon .

Abstract: Registering an object shape to a sequence of point clouds undergoing non-rigid deformation is a long-standing challenge. The key difficulties stem from two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of registration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which hinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation over long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges, we introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an efficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is designed to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging temporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The key to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a two-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for robust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a sliding-window fashion. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach (i) outperforms previous state-of-the-art on both the DeformingThings4D and D-FAUST datasets, and (ii) achieves more than 4x speedup compared to the previous best, offering significant efficiency improvement.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in text-to-video synthesis, generated video quality remains critically dependent on precise user prompts. Existing test-time optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation, the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual, audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg) to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL) formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically extracts spatial relations, e.g., , and encodes them as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally, these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters, validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.

<title>3DPR: Single Image 3D Portrait Relight using Generative Priors</title>

arXiv:2510.15846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry, material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods, particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering.

Abstract: Accurate tongue segmentation is crucial for reliable TCM analysis. Supervised models require large annotated datasets, while SAM-family models remain prompt-driven. We present Memory-SAM, a training-free, human-prompt-free pipeline that automatically generates effective prompts from a small memory of prior cases via dense DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval. Given a query image, mask-constrained correspondences to the retrieved exemplar are distilled into foreground/background point prompts that guide SAM2 without manual clicks or model fine-tuning. We evaluate on 600 expert-annotated images (300 controlled, 300 in-the-wild). On the mixed test split, Memory-SAM achieves mIoU 0.9863, surpassing FCN (0.8188) and a detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839). On controlled data, ceiling effects above 0.98 make small differences less meaningful given annotation variability, while our method shows clear gains under real-world conditions. Results indicate that retrieval-to-prompt enables data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular boundaries in tongue imaging. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/jw-chae/memory-sam.

Abstract: We present BLIP3o-NEXT, a fully open-source foundation model in the BLIP3 series that advances the next frontier of native image generation. BLIP3o-NEXT unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model, we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism. Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.

arXiv:2510.15866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent vectors or single textual prompts. This lack of transparency and failure to capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features, grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.

Abstract: Lens flare significantly degrades image quality, impacting critical computer vision tasks like object detection and autonomous driving. Recent Single Image Flare Removal (SIFR) methods perform poorly when off-frame light sources are incomplete or absent. We propose LightsOut, a diffusion-based outpainting framework tailored to enhance SIFR by reconstructing off-frame light sources. Our method leverages a multitask regression module and LoRA fine-tuned diffusion model to ensure realistic and physically consistent outpainting results. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate LightsOut consistently boosts the performance of existing SIFR methods across challenging scenarios without additional retraining, serving as a universally applicable plug-and-play preprocessing solution.

Abstract: Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation. For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii) Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model, OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

<title>Dissecting Mahalanobis: How Feature Geometry and Normalization Shape OOD Detection</title>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable. Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$ normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space, systematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly improve OOD detection performance. By bridging the gap between representation geometry, normalization, and OOD performance, our findings offer new insights into the design of more effective and reliable deep learning models.

Abstract: Document understanding is critical for applications from financial analysis to scientific discovery. Current approaches, whether OCR-based pipelines feeding Large Language Models (LLMs) or native Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), face key limitations: the former loses structural detail, while the latter struggles with context modeling. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) helps ground models in external data, but documents' multimodal nature, i.e., combining text, tables, charts, and layout, demands a more advanced paradigm: Multimodal RAG. This approach enables holistic retrieval and reasoning across all modalities, unlocking comprehensive document intelligence. Recognizing its importance, this paper presents a systematic survey of Multimodal RAG for document understanding. We propose a taxonomy based on domain, retrieval modality, and granularity, and review advances involving graph structures and agentic frameworks. We also summarize key datasets, benchmarks, and applications, and highlight open challenges in efficiency, fine-grained representation, and robustness, providing a roadmap for future progress in document AI.

<title>Neural Posterior Estimation for Cataloging Astronomical Images from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time</title>

Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will commence full-scale operations in 2026, yielding an unprecedented volume of astronomical images. Constructing an astronomical catalog, a table of imaged stars, galaxies, and their properties, is a fundamental step in most scientific workflows based on astronomical image data. Traditional deterministic cataloging methods lack statistical coherence as cataloging is an ill-posed problem, while existing probabilistic approaches suffer from computational inefficiency, inaccuracy, or the inability to perform inference with multiband coadded images, the primary output format for LSST images. In this article, we explore a recently developed Bayesian inference method called neural posterior estimation (NPE) as an approach to cataloging. NPE leverages deep learning to achieve both computational efficiency and high accuracy. When evaluated on the DC2 Simulated Sky Survey -- a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to mimic LSST data -- NPE systematically outperforms the standard LSST pipeline in light source detection, flux measurement, star/galaxy classification, and galaxy shape measurement. Additionally, NPE provides well-calibrated posterior approximations. These promising results, obtained using simulated data, illustrate the potential of NPE in the absence of model misspecification. Although some degree of model misspecification is inevitable in the application of NPE to real LSST images, there are a variety of strategies to mitigate its effects.

Abstract: Automated skin lesion segmentation through dermoscopic analysis is essential for early skin cancer detection, yet remains challenging due to limited annotated training data. We present MIRA-U, a semi-supervised framework that combines uncertainty-aware teacher-student pseudo-labeling with a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture. Our approach employs a teacher network pre-trained via masked image modeling to generate confidence-weighted soft pseudo-labels, which guide a U-shaped CNN-Transformer student network featuring cross-attention skip connections. This design enhances pseudo-label quality and boundary delineation, surpassing reconstruction-based and CNN-only baselines, particularly in low-annotation regimes. Extensive evaluation on ISIC-2016 and PH2 datasets demonstrates superior performance, achieving a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.9153 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.8552 using only 50% labeled data. Code is publicly available on GitHub.

<title>RankSEG-RMA: An Efficient Segmentation Algorithm via Reciprocal Moment Approximation</title>

Abstract: Semantic segmentation labels each pixel in an image with its corresponding class, and is typically evaluated using the Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice metrics to quantify the overlap between predicted and ground-truth segmentation masks. In the literature, most existing methods estimate pixel-wise class probabilities, then apply argmax or thresholding to obtain the final prediction. These methods have been shown to generally lead to inconsistent or suboptimal results, as they do not directly maximize segmentation metrics. To address this issue, a novel consistent segmentation framework, RankSEG, has been proposed, which includes RankDice and RankIoU specifically designed to optimize the Dice and IoU metrics, respectively. Although RankSEG almost guarantees improved performance, it suffers from two major drawbacks. First, it is its computational expense-RankDice has a complexity of O(d log d) with a substantial constant factor (where d represents the number of pixels), while RankIoU exhibits even higher complexity O(d^2), thus limiting its practical application. For instance, in LiTS, prediction with RankSEG takes 16.33 seconds compared to just 0.01 seconds with the argmax rule. Second, RankSEG is only applicable to overlapping segmentation settings, where multiple classes can occupy the same pixel, which contrasts with standard benchmarks that typically assume non-overlapping segmentation. In this paper, we overcome these two drawbacks via a reciprocal moment approximation (RMA) of RankSEG with the following contributions: (i) we improve RankSEG using RMA, namely RankSEG-RMA, reduces the complexity of both algorithms to O(d) while maintaining comparable performance; (ii) inspired by RMA, we develop a pixel-wise score function that allows efficient implementation for non-overlapping segmentation settings.

<title>VO-DP: Semantic-Geometric Adaptive Diffusion Policy for Vision-Only Robotic Manipulation</title>

Abstract: In the context of imitation learning, visuomotor-based diffusion policy learning is one of the main directions in robotic manipulation. Most of these approaches rely on point clouds as observation inputs and construct scene representations through point clouds feature learning, which enables them to achieve remarkable accuracy. However, the existing literature lacks an in-depth exploration of vision-only solutions that have significant potential. In this paper, we propose a Vision-Only and single-view Diffusion Policy learning method (VO-DP) that leverages pretrained visual foundation models to achieve effective fusion of semantic and geometric features. We utilize intermediate features from VGGT incorporating semantic features from DINOv2 and geometric features from Alternating Attention blocks. Features are fused via cross-attention and spatially compressed with a CNN to form the input to the policy head. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VO-DP not only outperforms the vision-only baseline DP significantly but also exhibits distinct performance trends against the point cloud-based method DP3: in simulation tasks, VO-DP achieves an average success rate of 64.6% on par with DP3 64.0% and far higher than DP 34.8%, while in real-world tasks, it reaches 87.9%, outperforming both DP3 67.5% and DP 11.2% by a notable margin. Further robustness evaluations confirm that VO-DP remains highly stable under varying conditions including color, size, background, and lighting. Lastly, we open-source a training library for robotic manipulation. Built on Accelerate, this library supports multi-machine and multi-GPU parallel training, as well as mixed precision training. It is compatible with visuomotor policies such as DP, DP3 and VO-DP, and also supports the RoboTwin simulator.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is vital for diagnosis and treatment planning. Although Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is widely used to estimate model uncertainty, its effectiveness in identifying segmentation errors -- especially near tumor boundaries -- remains unclear. This study empirically examines the relationship between MC Dropout--based uncertainty and segmentation error in 2D brain tumor MRI segmentation using a U-Net trained under four augmentation settings: none, horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. Uncertainty was computed from 50 stochastic forward passes and correlated with pixel-wise errors using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Results show weak global correlations ($r \approx 0.30$--$0.38$) and negligible boundary correlations ($|r| < 0.05$). Although differences across augmentations were statistically significant ($p < 0.001$), they lacked practical relevance. These findings suggest that MC Dropout uncertainty provides limited cues for boundary error localization, underscoring the need for alternative or hybrid uncertainty estimation methods in medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Temporal context in medicine is valuable in assessing key changes in patient health over time. We developed a machine learning framework to integrate diverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931 blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.

Abstract: Opaque objects reconstructed by 3DGS often exhibit a falsely transparent surface, leading to inconsistent background and internal patterns under camera motion in interactive viewing. This issue stems from the ill-posed optimization in 3DGS. During training, background and foreground Gaussians are blended via alpha-compositing and optimized solely against the input RGB images using a photometric loss. As this process lacks an explicit constraint on surface opacity, the optimization may incorrectly assign transparency to opaque regions, resulting in view-inconsistent and falsely transparent. This issue is difficult to detect in standard evaluation settings but becomes particularly evident in object-centric reconstructions under interactive viewing. Although other causes of view-inconsistency have been explored recently, false transparency has not been explicitly identified. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to identify, characterize, and develop solutions for this artifact, an underreported artifact in 3DGS. Our strategy, NGS, encourages surface Gaussians to adopt higher opacity by injecting opaque noise Gaussians in the object volume during training, requiring only minimal modifications to the existing splatting process. To quantitatively evaluate false transparency in static renderings, we propose a transmittance-based metric that measures the severity of this artifact. In addition, we introduce a customized, high-quality object-centric scan dataset exhibiting pronounced transparency issues, and we augment popular existing datasets with complementary infill noise specifically designed to assess the robustness of 3D reconstruction methods to false transparency. Experiments across multiple datasets show that NGS substantially reduces false transparency while maintaining competitive performance on standard rendering metrics, demonstrating its overall effectiveness.

Abstract: Poultry farming faces increasing pressure to meet productivity targets while ensuring animal welfare and environmental compliance. Yet many small and medium-sized farms lack affordable, integrated tools for continuous monitoring and decision-making, relying instead on manual, reactive inspections. This paper presents Poultry Farm Intelligence (PoultryFI) - a modular, cost-effective platform that integrates six AI-powered modules: Camera Placement Optimizer, Audio-Visual Monitoring, Analytics & Alerting, Real-Time Egg Counting, Production & Profitability Forecasting, and a Recommendation Module.
  Camera layouts are first optimized offline using evolutionary algorithms for full poultry house coverage with minimal hardware. The Audio-Visual Monitoring module extracts welfare indicators from synchronized video, audio, and feeding data. Analytics & Alerting produces daily summaries and real-time notifications, while Real-Time Egg Counting uses an edge vision model to automate production tracking. Forecasting models predict egg yield and feed consumption up to 10 days in advance, and the Recommendation Module integrates forecasts with weather data to guide environmental and operational adjustments.
  This is among the first systems to combine low-cost sensing, edge analytics, and prescriptive AI to continuously monitor flocks, predict production, and optimize performance. Field trials demonstrate 100% egg-count accuracy on Raspberry Pi 5, robust anomaly detection, and reliable short-term forecasting. PoultryFI bridges the gap between isolated pilot tools and scalable, farm-wide intelligence, empowering producers to proactively safeguard welfare and profitability.

Abstract: Light field images capture multi-view scene information and play a crucial role in 3D scene reconstruction. However, their high-dimensional nature results in enormous data volumes, posing a significant challenge for efficient compression in practical storage and transmission scenarios. Although neural representation-based methods have shown promise in light field image compression, most approaches rely on direct coordinate-to-pixel mapping through implicit neural representation (INR), often neglecting the explicit modeling of scene structure. Moreover, they typically lack end-to-end rate-distortion optimization, limiting their compression efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose SANR, a Scene-Aware Neural Representation framework for light field image compression with end-to-end rate-distortion optimization. For scene awareness, SANR introduces a hierarchical scene modeling block that leverages multi-scale latent codes to capture intrinsic scene structures, thereby reducing the information gap between INR input coordinates and the target light field image. From a compression perspective, SANR is the first to incorporate entropy-constrained quantization-aware training (QAT) into neural representation-based light field image compression, enabling end-to-end rate-distortion optimization. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that SANR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques regarding rate-distortion performance with a 65.62\% BD-rate saving against HEVC.

Abstract: Academic project websites can more effectively disseminate research when they clearly present core content and enable intuitive navigation and interaction. However, current approaches such as direct Large Language Model (LLM) generation, templates, or direct HTML conversion struggle to produce layout-aware, interactive sites, and a comprehensive evaluation suite for this task has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce Paper2Web, a benchmark dataset and multi-dimensional evaluation framework for assessing academic webpage generation. It incorporates rule-based metrics like Connectivity, Completeness and human-verified LLM-as-a-Judge (covering interactivity, aesthetics, and informativeness), and PaperQuiz, which measures paper-level knowledge retention. We further present PWAgent, an autonomous pipeline that converts scientific papers into interactive and multimedia-rich academic homepages. The agent iteratively refines both content and layout through MCP tools that enhance emphasis, balance, and presentation quality. Our experiments show that PWAgent consistently outperforms end-to-end baselines like template-based webpages and arXiv/alphaXiv versions by a large margin while maintaining low cost, achieving the Pareto-front in academic webpage generation.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as state-of-the-art models for various vision tasks recently. However, their heavy computation costs remain daunting for resource-limited devices. To address this, researchers have dedicated themselves to compressing redundant information in ViTs for acceleration. However, existing approaches generally sparsely drop redundant image tokens by token pruning or brutally remove channels by channel pruning, leading to a sub-optimal balance between model performance and inference speed. Moreover, they struggle when transferring compressed models to downstream vision tasks that require the spatial structure of images, such as semantic segmentation. To tackle these issues, we propose CAIT, a joint \underline{c}ompression method for ViTs that achieves a harmonious blend of high \underline{a}ccuracy, fast \underline{i}nference speed, and favorable \underline{t}ransferability to downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduce an asymmetric token merging (ATME) strategy to effectively integrate neighboring tokens. It can successfully compress redundant token information while preserving the spatial structure of images. On top of it, we further design a consistent dynamic channel pruning (CDCP) strategy to dynamically prune unimportant channels in ViTs. Thanks to CDCP, insignificant channels in multi-head self-attention modules of ViTs can be pruned uniformly, significantly enhancing the model compression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance across various ViTs.

Abstract: We introduce MotionScript, a novel framework for generating highly detailed, natural language descriptions of 3D human motions. Unlike existing motion datasets that rely on broad action labels or generic captions, MotionScript provides fine-grained, structured descriptions that capture the full complexity of human movement including expressive actions (e.g., emotions, stylistic walking) and interactions beyond standard motion capture datasets. MotionScript serves as both a descriptive tool and a training resource for text-to-motion models, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and diverse human motions from text. By augmenting motion datasets with MotionScript captions, we demonstrate significant improvements in out-of-distribution motion generation, allowing large language models (LLMs) to generate motions that extend beyond existing data. Additionally, MotionScript opens new applications in animation, virtual human simulation, and robotics, providing an interpretable bridge between intuitive descriptions and motion synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to systematically translate 3D motion into structured natural language without requiring training data.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress having been made on the problem of 3D human pose and shape estimation (HPS), current state-of-the-art methods rely heavily on either confined indoor mocap datasets or datasets generated by a rendering engine using computer graphics (CG). Both categories of datasets exhibit inadequacies in furnishing adequate human identities and authentic in-the-wild background scenes, which are crucial for accurately simulating real-world distributions. In this work, we show that synthetic data created by generative models is complementary to CG-rendered data for achieving remarkable generalization performance on diverse real-world scenes. We propose an effective data generation pipeline based on recent diffusion models, termed HumanWild, which can effortlessly generate human images and corresponding 3D mesh annotations. Specifically, we first collect a large-scale human-centric dataset with comprehensive annotations, e.g, text captions, the depth map, and surface normal images. To generate a wide variety of human images with initial labels, we train a customized, multi-condition ControlNet model. The key to this process is using a 3D parametric model, e.g, SMPL-X, to create various condition inputs easily. Our data generation pipeline is both flexible and customizable, making it adaptable to multiple real-world tasks, such as human interaction in complex scenes and humans captured by wide-angle lenses. By relying solely on generative models, we can produce large-scale, in-the-wild human images with high-quality annotations, significantly reducing the need for manual image collection and annotation. The generated dataset encompasses a wide range of viewpoints, environments, and human identities, ensuring its versatility across different scenarios. We hope that our work could pave the way for scaling up 3D human recovery to in-the-wild scenes.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in image segmentation and object detection, understanding complex scenes remains a significant challenge. Here, we focus on graphical humor as a paradigmatic example of image interpretation that requires elucidating the interaction of different scene elements in the context of prior cognitive knowledge. This paper introduces \textbf{HumorDB}, a novel, controlled, and carefully curated dataset designed to evaluate and advance visual humor understanding by AI systems. The dataset comprises diverse images spanning photos, cartoons, sketches, and AI-generated content, including minimally contrastive pairs where subtle edits differentiate between humorous and non-humorous versions. We evaluate humans, state-of-the-art vision models, and large vision-language models on three tasks: binary humor classification, funniness rating prediction, and pairwise humor comparison. The results reveal a gap between current AI systems and human-level humor understanding. While pretrained vision-language models perform better than vision-only models, they still struggle with abstract sketches and subtle humor cues. Analysis of attention maps shows that even when models correctly classify humorous images, they often fail to focus on the precise regions that make the image funny. Preliminary mechanistic interpretability studies and evaluation of model explanations provide initial insights into how different architectures process humor. Our results identify promising trends and current limitations, suggesting that an effective understanding of visual humor requires sophisticated architectures capable of detecting subtle contextual features and bridging the gap between visual perception and abstract reasoning.

Abstract: Mobile service robots can benefit from object-level understanding of their environments, including the ability to distinguish object instances and re-identify previously seen instances. Object re-identification is challenging across different viewpoints and in scenes with significant appearance variation arising from weather or lighting changes. Existing works on object re-identification either focus on specific classes or require foreground segmentation. Further, these methods, along with object re-identification datasets, have limited consideration of challenges such as outdoor scenes and illumination changes. To address this problem, we introduce CODa Re-ID: an in-the-wild object re-identification dataset containing 1,037,814 observations of 557 objects across 8 classes under diverse lighting conditions and viewpoints. Further, we propose CLOVER, a representation learning method for object observations that can distinguish between static object instances without requiring foreground segmentation. We also introduce MapCLOVER, a method for scalably summarizing CLOVER descriptors for use in object maps and matching new observations to summarized descriptors. Our results show that CLOVER achieves superior performance in static object re-identification under varying lighting conditions and viewpoint changes and can generalize to unseen instances and classes.

Abstract: Environment prediction frameworks are critical for the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in dynamic settings. LiDAR-generated occupancy grid maps (L-OGMs) offer a robust bird's-eye view for the scene representation, enabling self-supervised joint scene predictions while exhibiting resilience to partial observability and perception detection failures. Prior approaches have focused on deterministic L-OGM prediction architectures within the grid cell space. While these methods have seen some success, they frequently produce unrealistic predictions and fail to capture the stochastic nature of the environment. Additionally, they do not effectively integrate additional sensor modalities present in AVs. Our proposed framework, Latent Occupancy Prediction (LOPR), performs stochastic L-OGM prediction in the latent space of a generative architecture and allows for conditioning on RGB cameras, maps, and planned trajectories. We decode predictions using either a single-step decoder, which provides high-quality predictions in real-time, or a diffusion-based batch decoder, which can further refine the decoded frames to address temporal consistency issues and reduce compression losses. Our experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets show that all variants of our approach qualitatively and quantitatively outperform prior approaches.

Abstract: Modern autonomous vehicle perception systems often struggle with occlusions and limited perception range. Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of cooperative perception in extending the perception range and overcoming occlusions, thereby enhancing the safety of autonomous driving. In recent years, a series of cooperative perception datasets have emerged; however, these datasets primarily focus on cameras and LiDAR, neglecting 4D Radar, a sensor used in single-vehicle autonomous driving to provide robust perception in adverse weather conditions. In this paper, to bridge the gap created by the absence of 4D Radar datasets in cooperative perception, we present V2X-Radar, the first large-scale, real-world multi-modal dataset featuring 4D Radar. V2X-Radar dataset is collected using a connected vehicle platform and an intelligent roadside unit equipped with 4D Radar, LiDAR, and multi-view cameras. The collected data encompasses sunny and rainy weather conditions, spanning daytime, dusk, and nighttime, as well as various typical challenging scenarios. The dataset consists of 20K LiDAR frames, 40K camera images, and 20K 4D Radar data, including 350K annotated boxes across five categories. To support various research domains, we have established V2X-Radar-C for cooperative perception, V2X-Radar-I for roadside perception, and V2X-Radar-V for single-vehicle perception. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive benchmarks across these three sub-datasets. We will release all datasets and benchmark codebase at http://openmpd.com/column/V2X-Radar and https://github.com/yanglei18/V2X-Radar.

<title>PrefixKV: Adaptive Prefix KV Cache is What Vision Instruction-Following Models Need for Efficient Generation</title>

Abstract: Recently, large vision-language models (LVLMs) have rapidly gained popularity for their strong generation and reasoning capabilities given diverse multimodal inputs. However, these models incur significant computational and memory overhead during inference, which greatly hinders the efficient deployment in practical scenarios. The extensive key-value (KV) cache, necessitated by the lengthy input and output sequences, notably contributes to the high inference cost. Based on this, recent works have investigated ways to reduce the KV cache size for higher efficiency. Although effective, they generally overlook the distinct importance distributions of KV vectors across layers and maintain the same cache size for each layer during the next token prediction. This results in the significant contextual information loss for certain layers, leading to notable performance decline. To address this, we present PrefixKV, where "Prefix" means the top-ranked KV based on importance rather than position in the original sequence. It reframes the challenge of determining KV cache sizes for all layers into the task of searching for the optimal global prefix configuration. With an adaptive layer-wise KV retention recipe based on binary search, the maximum contextual information can thus be preserved in each layer, facilitating the generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with others. It exhibits superior inference efficiency and generation quality trade-offs, showing promising potential for practical applications. Code is available at https://github.com/THU-MIG/PrefixKV.

Abstract: In recent times, the standard practice for developing MLLMs is to feed features from vision encoder(s) into the LLM and train with natural language supervision. This approach often causes models to lean towards language comprehension and undermine the rich visual perception signals present in the data, which are critical for tasks involving spatial reasoning in the domain of embodied AI and robotics. Is it possible to optimize both at the same time? In this work, we propose VisPer-LM, the first approach that infuses visual perception knowledge from expert vision encoders into the LLM's (of an MLLM) hidden representations. We start by investigating MLLMs trained solely with natural language supervision and identify a positive correlation between the quality of visual representations within these models and their downstream performance. Given this insight, we formulate the objective during the pretraining stage in MLLMs as a coupled optimization of predictive visual embedding and next (text) token prediction. Moreover, through extensive probing, we observe improved visual representation quality due to embedding optimization, underscoring the effectiveness of our probing setup. We demonstrate that our VisPer-LM outperforms the single and multi-encoder baselines, proving our approach's superiority over explicitly feeding the corresponding features to the LLM. In particular, VisPer-LM boosts performance by an average margin of up to 2.5% on various benchmarks, with a notable improvement of 8.7% on the Depth task in CV-Bench.

Abstract: Quantitative tools are increasingly appealing for decision support in healthcare, driven by the growing capabilities of advanced AI systems. However, understanding the predictive uncertainties surrounding a tool's output is crucial for decision-makers to ensure reliable and transparent decisions. In this paper, we present a case study on pulmonary nodule detection for lung cancer screening, enhancing an advanced detection model with an uncertainty quantification technique called conformal risk control (CRC). We demonstrate that prediction sets with conformal guarantees are attractive measures of predictive uncertainty in the safety-critical healthcare domain, allowing end-users to achieve arbitrary validity by trading off false positives and providing formal statistical guarantees on model performance. Among ground-truth nodules annotated by at least three radiologists, our model achieves a sensitivity that is competitive with that generally achieved by individual radiologists, with a slight increase in false positives. Furthermore, we illustrate the risks of using off-the-shelve prediction models when faced with ontological uncertainty, such as when radiologists disagree on what constitutes the ground truth on pulmonary nodules.

Abstract: Domain-generalizable re-identification (DG Re-ID) aims to train a model on one or more source domains and evaluate its performance on unseen target domains, a task that has attracted growing attention due to its practical relevance. While numerous methods have been proposed, most rely on discriminative or contrastive learning frameworks to learn generalizable feature representations. However, these approaches often fail to mitigate shortcut learning, leading to suboptimal performance. In this work, we propose a novel method called diffusion model-assisted representation learning with a correlation-aware conditioning scheme (DCAC) to enhance DG Re-ID. Our method integrates a discriminative and contrastive Re-ID model with a pre-trained diffusion model through a correlation-aware conditioning scheme. By incorporating ID classification probabilities generated from the Re-ID model with a set of learnable ID-wise prompts, the conditioning scheme injects dark knowledge that captures ID correlations to guide the diffusion process. Simultaneously, feedback from the diffusion model is back-propagated through the conditioning scheme to the Re-ID model, effectively improving the generalization capability of Re-ID features. Extensive experiments on both single-source and multi-source DG Re-ID tasks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, providing insights into its robustness. Codes will be available at https://github.com/RikoLi/DCAC.

Abstract: The proliferation of generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models, and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), has enabled the synthesis of high-quality multimedia data. However, these advancements have also raised significant concerns regarding adversarial attacks, unethical usage, and societal harm. Recognizing these challenges, researchers have increasingly focused on developing methodologies to detect synthesized data effectively, aiming to mitigate potential risks. Prior reviews have predominantly focused on deepfake detection and often overlook recent advancements in synthetic image forensics, particularly approaches that incorporate multimodal frameworks, reasoning-based detection, and training-free methodologies. To bridge this gap, this survey provides a comprehensive and up-to-date review of state-of-the-art techniques for detecting and classifying synthetic images generated by advanced generative AI models. The review systematically examines core detection paradigms, categorizes them into spatial-domain, frequency-domain, fingerprint-based, patch-based, training-free, and multimodal reasoning-based frameworks, and offers concise descriptions of their underlying principles. We further provide detailed comparative analyses of these methods on publicly available datasets to assess their generalizability, robustness, and interpretability. Finally, the survey highlights open challenges and future directions, emphasizing the potential of hybrid frameworks that combine the efficiency of training-free approaches with the semantic reasoning of multimodal models to advance trustworthy and explainable synthetic image forensics.

Abstract: Autoregressive models have achieved promising results in natural language processing. However, for image generation tasks, they encounter substantial challenges in effectively capturing long-range dependencies, managing computational costs, and most crucially, defining meaningful autoregressive sequences that reflect natural image hierarchies. To address these issues, we present \textbf{N}ext-\textbf{F}requency \textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}eneration (\textbf{NFIG}), a novel framework that decomposes the image generation process into multiple frequency-guided stages. Our approach first generates low-frequency components to establish global structure with fewer tokens, then progressively adds higher-frequency details, following the natural spectral hierarchy of images. This principled autoregressive sequence not only improves the quality of generated images by better capturing true causal relationships between image components, but also significantly reduces computational overhead during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFIG achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer steps, offering a more efficient solution for image generation, with 1.25$\times$ speedup compared to VAR-d20 while achieving better performance (FID: 2.81) on the ImageNet-256 benchmark. We hope that our insight of incorporating frequency-domain knowledge to guide autoregressive sequence design will shed light on future research. We will make our code publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Object detection and segmentation are widely employed in computer vision applications, yet conventional models like YOLO series, while efficient and accurate, are limited by predefined categories, hindering adaptability in open scenarios. Recent open-set methods leverage text prompts, visual cues, or prompt-free paradigm to overcome this, but often compromise between performance and efficiency due to high computational demands or deployment complexity. In this work, we introduce YOLOE, which integrates detection and segmentation across diverse open prompt mechanisms within a single highly efficient model, achieving real-time seeing anything. For text prompts, we propose Re-parameterizable Region-Text Alignment (RepRTA) strategy. It refines pretrained textual embeddings via a re-parameterizable lightweight auxiliary network and enhances visual-textual alignment with zero inference and transferring overhead. For visual prompts, we present Semantic-Activated Visual Prompt Encoder (SAVPE). It employs decoupled semantic and activation branches to bring improved visual embedding and accuracy with minimal complexity. For prompt-free scenario, we introduce Lazy Region-Prompt Contrast (LRPC) strategy. It utilizes a built-in large vocabulary and specialized embedding to identify all objects, avoiding costly language model dependency. Extensive experiments show YOLOE's exceptional zero-shot performance and transferability with high inference efficiency and low training cost. Notably, on LVIS, with 3$\times$ less training cost and 1.4$\times$ inference speedup, YOLOE-v8-S surpasses YOLO-Worldv2-S by 3.5 AP. When transferring to COCO, YOLOE-v8-L achieves 0.6 AP$^b$ and 0.4 AP$^m$ gains over closed-set YOLOv8-L with nearly 4$\times$ less training time. Code and models are available at https://github.com/THU-MIG/yoloe.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of LiDAR-based place recognition, which traditionally depends on costly and time-consuming prior 3D maps. To overcome this, we first construct XA-L\&amp;RSI dataset, which encompasses approximately $110,000$ remote sensing submaps and $13,000$ LiDAR point cloud submaps captured in urban scenes, and propose a novel method, L2RSI, for cross-view LiDAR place recognition using high-resolution Remote Sensing Imagery. This approach enables large-scale localization capabilities at a reduced cost by leveraging readily available overhead images as map proxies. L2RSI addresses the dual challenges of cross-view and cross-modal place recognition by learning feature alignment between point cloud submaps and remote sensing submaps in the semantic domain. Additionally, we introduce a novel probability propagation method based on particle estimation to refine position predictions, effectively leveraging temporal and spatial information. This approach enables large-scale retrieval and cross-scene generalization without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on XA-L\&amp;RSI demonstrate that, within a $100km^2$ retrieval range, L2RSI accurately localizes $83.27\%$ of point cloud submaps within a $30m$ radius for top-$1$ retrieved location.

Abstract: Recent advances in LiDAR 3D detection have demonstrated the effectiveness of Transformer-based frameworks in capturing the global dependencies from point cloud spaces, which serialize the 3D voxels into the flattened 1D sequence for iterative self-attention. However, the spatial structure of 3D voxels will be inevitably destroyed during the serialization process. Besides, due to the considerable number of 3D voxels and quadratic complexity of Transformers, multiple sequences are grouped before feeding to Transformers, leading to a limited receptive field. Inspired by the impressive performance of State Space Models (SSM) achieved in the field of 2D vision tasks, in this paper, we propose a novel Unified Mamba (UniMamba), which seamlessly integrates the merits of 3D convolution and SSM in a concise multi-head manner, aiming to perform "local and global" spatial context aggregation efficiently and simultaneously. Specifically, a UniMamba block is designed which mainly consists of spatial locality modeling, complementary Z-order serialization and local-global sequential aggregator. The spatial locality modeling module integrates 3D submanifold convolution to capture the dynamic spatial position embedding before serialization. Then the efficient Z-order curve is adopted for serialization both horizontally and vertically. Furthermore, the local-global sequential aggregator adopts the channel grouping strategy to efficiently encode both "local and global" spatial inter-dependencies using multi-head SSM. Additionally, an encoder-decoder architecture with stacked UniMamba blocks is formed to facilitate multi-scale spatial learning hierarchically. Extensive experiments are conducted on three popular datasets: nuScenes, Waymo and Argoverse 2. Particularly, our UniMamba achieves 70.2 mAP on the nuScenes dataset.

<title>A Plug-and-Play Learning-based IMU Bias Factor for Robust Visual-Inertial Odometry</title>

Abstract: Accurate and reliable estimation of biases of low-cost Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) is a key factor to maintain the resilience of Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO), particularly when visual tracking fails in challenging areas. In such cases, bias estimates from the VIO can deviate significantly from the real values because of the insufficient or erroneous vision features, compromising both localization accuracy and system stability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel plug-and-play module featuring the Inertial Prior Network (IPNet), which infers an IMU bias prior by implicitly capturing the motion characteristics of specific platforms. The core idea is inspired intuitively by the observation that different platforms exhibit distinctive motion patterns, while the integration of low-cost IMU measurements suffers from unbounded error that quickly accumulates over time. Therefore, these specific motion patterns can be exploited to infer the underlying IMU bias. In this work, we first directly infer the biases prior only using the raw IMU data using a sliding window approach, eliminating the dependency on recursive bias estimation combining visual features, thus effectively preventing error propagation in challenging areas. Moreover, to compensate for the lack of ground-truth bias in most visual-inertial datasets, we further introduce an iterative method to compute the mean per-sequence IMU bias for network training and release it to benefit society. The framework is trained and evaluated separately on two public datasets and a self-collected dataset. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves localization precision and robustness.

Abstract: We present a latent diffusion model for fast feed-forward 3D scene generation. Given one or more images, our model Bolt3D directly samples a 3D scene representation in less than seven seconds on a single GPU. We achieve this by leveraging powerful and scalable existing 2D diffusion network architectures to produce consistent high-fidelity 3D scene representations. To train this model, we create a large-scale multiview-consistent dataset of 3D geometry and appearance by applying state-of-the-art dense 3D reconstruction techniques to existing multiview image datasets. Compared to prior multiview generative models that require per-scene optimization for 3D reconstruction, Bolt3D reduces the inference cost by a factor of up to 300 times.

Abstract: Reconstructing clothed humans from a single image is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications. Although existing monocular clothed human reconstruction solutions have shown promising results, they often rely on the assumption that the human subject is in an occlusion-free environment. Thus, when encountering in-the-wild occluded images, these algorithms produce multiview inconsistent and fragmented reconstructions. Additionally, most algorithms for monocular 3D human reconstruction leverage geometric priors such as SMPL annotations for training and inference, which are extremely challenging to acquire in real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose CHROME: Clothed Human Reconstruction with Occlusion-Resilience and Multiview-ConsistEncy from a Single Image, a novel pipeline designed to reconstruct occlusion-resilient 3D humans with multiview consistency from a single occluded image, without requiring either ground-truth geometric prior annotations or 3D supervision. Specifically, CHROME leverages a multiview diffusion model to first synthesize occlusion-free human images from the occluded input, compatible with off-the-shelf pose control to explicitly enforce cross-view consistency during synthesis. A 3D reconstruction model is then trained to predict a set of 3D Gaussians conditioned on both the occluded input and synthesized views, aligning cross-view details to produce a cohesive and accurate 3D representation.

Abstract: Four-dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) reconstruction is crucial for capturing dynamic anatomical changes but faces inherent limitations from conventional phase-binning workflows. Current methods discretize temporal resolution into fixed phases with respiratory gating devices, introducing motion misalignment and restricting clinical practicality. In this paper, We propose X$^2$-Gaussian, a novel framework that enables continuous-time 4D-CT reconstruction by integrating dynamic radiative Gaussian splatting with self-supervised respiratory motion learning. Our approach models anatomical dynamics through a spatiotemporal encoder-decoder architecture that predicts time-varying Gaussian deformations, eliminating phase discretization. To remove dependency on external gating devices, we introduce a physiology-driven periodic consistency loss that learns patient-specific breathing cycles directly from projections via differentiable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 9.93 dB PSNR gain over traditional methods and 2.25 dB improvement against prior Gaussian splatting techniques. By unifying continuous motion modeling with hardware-free period learning, X$^2$-Gaussian advances high-fidelity 4D CT reconstruction for dynamic clinical imaging.

Abstract: Generating human videos from a single image while ensuring high visual quality and precise control is a challenging task, especially in complex scenarios involving multiple individuals and interactions with objects. Existing methods, while effective for single-human cases, often fail to handle the intricacies of multi-identity interactions because they struggle to associate the correct pairs of human appearance and pose condition and model the distribution of 3D-aware dynamics. To address these limitations, we present \emph{Structural Video Diffusion}, a novel framework designed for generating realistic multi-human videos. Our approach introduces two core innovations: identity-specific embeddings to maintain consistent appearances across individuals and a structural learning mechanism that incorporates depth and surface-normal cues to model human-object interactions. Additionally, we expand existing human video dataset with 25K new videos featuring diverse multi-human and object interaction scenarios, providing a robust foundation for training. Experimental results demonstrate that Structural Video Diffusion achieves superior performance in generating lifelike, coherent videos for multiple subjects with dynamic and rich interactions, advancing the state of human-centric video generation.

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment new classes using few annotated images. While recent FSS methods have shown considerable improvements by leveraging Segment Anything Model (SAM), they face two critical limitations: insufficient utilization of structural correlations in query images, and significant information loss when converting continuous position priors to discrete point prompts. To address these challenges, we propose CMaP-SAM, a novel framework that introduces contraction mapping theory to optimize position priors for SAM-driven few-shot segmentation. CMaP-SAM consists of three key components: (1) a contraction mapping module that formulates position prior optimization as a Banach contraction mapping with convergence guarantees. This module iteratively refines position priors through pixel-wise structural similarity, generating a converged prior that preserves both semantic guidance from reference images and structural correlations in query images; (2) an adaptive distribution alignment module bridging continuous priors with SAM's binary mask prompt encoder; and (3) a foreground-background decoupled refinement architecture producing accurate final segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate CMaP-SAM's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 71.1 mIoU on PASCAL-$5^i$ and 56.1 on COCO-$20^i$ datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/Chenfan0206/CMaP-SAM.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time 3D reconstruction of human heads from monocular images and videos underlies numerous visual applications. As 3D ground truth data is hard to come by at scale, previous methods have sought to learn from abundant 2D videos in a self-supervised manner. Typically, this involves the use of differentiable mesh rendering, which is effective but faces limitations. To improve on this, we propose SHeaP (Self-supervised Head Geometry Predictor Learned via 2D Gaussians). Given a source image, we predict a 3DMM mesh and a set of Gaussians that are rigged to this mesh. We then reanimate this rigged head avatar to match a target frame, and backpropagate photometric losses to both the 3DMM and Gaussian prediction networks. We find that using Gaussians for rendering substantially improves the effectiveness of this self-supervised approach. Training solely on 2D data, our method surpasses existing self-supervised approaches in geometric evaluations on the NoW benchmark for neutral faces and a new benchmark for non-neutral expressions. Our method also produces highly expressive meshes, outperforming state-of-the-art in emotion classification.

Abstract: The fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and RGB imagery for land cover classification remains challenging due to modality heterogeneity and underexploited spectral complementarity. Existing approaches often fail to decouple shared structural features from modality-complementary radiometric attributes, resulting in feature conflicts and information loss. To address this, we propose Phase-Amplitude Decoupling (PAD), a frequency-aware framework that separates phase (modality-shared) and amplitude (modality-complementary) components in the Fourier domain. This design reinforces shared structures while preserving complementary characteristics, thereby enhancing fusion quality. Unlike previous methods that overlook the distinct physical properties encoded in frequency spectra, PAD explicitly introduces amplitude-phase decoupling for multi-modal fusion. Specifically, PAD comprises two key components: 1) Phase Spectrum Correction (PSC), which aligns cross-modal phase features via convolution-guided scaling to improve geometric consistency; and 2) Amplitude Spectrum Fusion (ASF), which dynamically integrates high- and low-frequency patterns using frequency-adaptive multilayer perceptrons, effectively exploiting SAR's morphological sensitivity and RGB's spectral richness. Extensive experiments on WHU-OPT-SAR and DDHR-SK demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. This work establishes a new paradigm for physics-aware multi-modal fusion in remote sensing. The code will be available at https://github.com/RanFeng2/PAD.

Abstract: Fake news detection remains a challenging problem due to the complex interplay between textual misinformation, manipulated images, and external knowledge reasoning. While existing approaches have achieved notable results in verifying veracity and cross-modal consistency, two key challenges persist: (1) Existing methods often consider only the global image context while neglecting local object-level details, and (2) they fail to incorporate external knowledge and entity relationships for deeper semantic understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-modal fake news detection framework that integrates visual, textual, and knowledge-based representations. Our approach leverages bottom-up attention to capture fine-grained object details, CLIP for global image semantics, and RoBERTa for context-aware text encoding. We further enhance knowledge utilization by retrieving and adaptively selecting relevant entities from a knowledge graph. The fused multi-modal features are processed through a Transformer-based classifier to predict news veracity. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms recent approaches, showcasing the effectiveness of neighbor selection mechanism and multi-modal fusion for fake news detection. Our proposal introduces a new paradigm: knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. By integrating explicit entity-level selection and NLI-guided filtering, we shift fake news detection from feature fusion to semantically grounded verification.

Abstract: We study the task of panoptic symbol spotting, which involves identifying both individual instances of countable things and the semantic regions of uncountable stuff in computer-aided design (CAD) drawings composed of vector graphical primitives. Existing methods typically rely on image rasterization, graph construction, or point-based representation, but these approaches often suffer from high computational costs, limited generality, and loss of geometric structural information. In this paper, we propose VecFormer, a novel method that addresses these challenges through line-based representation of primitives. This design preserves the geometric continuity of the original primitive, enabling more accurate shape representation while maintaining a computation-friendly structure, making it well-suited for vector graphic understanding tasks. To further enhance prediction reliability, we introduce a Branch Fusion Refinement module that effectively integrates instance and semantic predictions, resolving their inconsistencies for more coherent panoptic outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving 91.1 PQ, with Stuff-PQ improved by 9.6 and 21.2 points over the second-best results under settings with and without prior information, respectively, highlighting the strong potential of line-based representation as a foundation for vector graphic understanding.

Abstract: Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES) tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone rapid progress, largely attributed to reinforcement learning on complex reasoning tasks. In contrast, while spatial intelligence is fundamental for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world interaction, the systematic study of their complex spatial reasoning remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SIRI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' structural spatial intelligence through spatial-grounded reasoning tasks. SIRI-Bench comprises 9,000 video-question-answer triplets, where each problem is embedded in a realistic 3D scene. The benchmark is carefully designed so that solving each problem requires both spatial comprehension and structural reasoning. To facilitate large-scale data synthesis, we develop an Automatic Scene Creation Engine that employs collaborative LLM agents to translate abstract mathematical problems into faithful 3D scenes. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle significantly on SIRI-Bench, underscoring the challenge of structural spatial reasoning. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to spatially grounded reasoning and advance VLMs in visual problem-solving.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and high-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D representations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant attention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous applications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on transformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they rely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting in prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution increases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we introduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D Gaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by three core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view images to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional multi-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce computational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every layer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely used datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms existing methods in both reconstruction quality and speed.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful and computationally efficient representation for 3D reconstruction. Despite its strengths, 3DGS often produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS), which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion, effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of 1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks. Project Website: https://jcwang-gh.github.io/EFA-GS

Abstract: State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown promise in NLP tasks and are increasingly applied to vision tasks. However, most Mamba-based vision models focus on network architecture and scan paths, with little attention to the SSM module. In order to explore the potential of SSMs, we modified the calculation process of SSM without increasing the number of parameters to improve the performance on lightweight super-resolution tasks. In this paper, we introduce the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to improve the original Mamba module, enhancing performance by incorporating token correlations. We apply a first-order hold condition in SSMs, derive the new discretized form, and analyzed cumulative error. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark datasets without additionally increasing the number of parameters, and surpasses current lightweight SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance. However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks has become increasingly demanding, requiring large datasets and significant computational resources, especially as model complexity advances. Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data efficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field of single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training datasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR was proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the current method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific information, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these issues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does not need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract high-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then fine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution and synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less training data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we train a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\% of the original dataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model fine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much shorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score), optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code will be released at https://ruoyuchen10.github.io/EAGLE/.

Abstract: Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation. Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement, RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally, Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation. For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples. Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have greatly enhanced both image editing and in-context image generation, yet a critical gap remains in ensuring physical consistency, where edited objects must remain coherent. This capability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this paper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a video generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images as the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large pretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but also the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal consistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that explicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, target frame is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing trajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable transformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to avoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video. To validate ChronoEdit, we introduce PBench-Edit, a new benchmark of image-prompt pairs for contexts that require physical consistency, and demonstrate that ChronoEdit surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both visual fidelity and physical plausibility.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However, training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement), which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

Abstract: Environment prediction frameworks are integral for autonomous vehicles, enabling safe navigation in dynamic environments. LiDAR generated occupancy grid maps (L-OGMs) offer a robust bird's eye-view scene representation that facilitates joint scene predictions without relying on manual labeling unlike commonly used trajectory prediction frameworks. Prior approaches have optimized deterministic L-OGM prediction architectures directly in grid cell space. While these methods have achieved some degree of success in prediction, they occasionally grapple with unrealistic and incorrect predictions. We claim that the quality and realism of the forecasted occupancy grids can be enhanced with the use of generative models. We propose a framework that decouples occupancy prediction into: representation learning and stochastic prediction within the learned latent space. Our approach allows for conditioning the model on other available sensor modalities such as RGB-cameras and high definition maps. We demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and is readily transferable between different robotic platforms on the real-world NuScenes, Waymo Open, and a custom dataset we collected on an experimental vehicle platform.

Abstract: Embodied navigation methods commonly operate in static environments with stationary targets. In this work, we present a new algorithm for navigation in dynamic scenarios with non-stationary targets. Our novel Transit-Aware Strategy (TAS) enriches embodied navigation policies with object path information. TAS improves performance in non-stationary environments by rewarding agents for synchronizing their routes with target routes. To evaluate TAS, we further introduce Dynamic Object Maps (DOMs), a dynamic variant of node-attributed topological graphs with structured object transitions. DOMs are inspired by human habits to simulate realistic object routes on a graph. Our experiments show that on average, TAS improves agent Success Rate (SR) by 21.1 in non-stationary environments, while also generalizing better from static environments by 44.5% when measured by Relative Change in Success (RCS). We qualitatively investigate TAS-agent performance on DOMs and draw various inferences to help better model generalist navigation policies. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first work that quantifies the adaptability of embodied navigation methods in non-stationary environments. Code and data for our benchmark will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Objectives: High classification accuracy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from structural MRI has been achieved using deep neural networks, yet the specific image features contributing to these decisions remain unclear. In this study, the contributions of T1-weighted (T1w) gray-white matter texture, volumetric information, and preprocessing -- particularly skull-stripping -- were systematically assessed.
  Methods: A dataset of 990 matched T1w MRIs from AD patients and cognitively normal controls from the ADNI database were used. Preprocessing was varied through skull-stripping and intensity binarization to isolate texture and shape contributions. A 3D convolutional neural network was trained on each configuration, and classification performance was compared using exact McNemar tests with discrete Bonferroni-Holm correction. Feature relevance was analyzed using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation, image similarity metrics, and spectral clustering of relevance maps.
  Results: Despite substantial differences in image content, classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity remained stable across preprocessing conditions. Models trained on binarized images preserved performance, indicating minimal reliance on gray-white matter texture. Instead, volumetric features -- particularly brain contours introduced through skull-stripping -- were consistently used by the models.
  Conclusions: This behavior reflects a shortcut learning phenomenon, where preprocessing artifacts act as potentially unintended cues. The resulting Clever Hans effect emphasizes the critical importance of interpretability tools to reveal hidden biases and to ensure robust and trustworthy deep learning in medical imaging.

Abstract: We identify two major limitations in the existing studies on retinal vessel segmentation: (1) Most existing works are restricted to one modality, i.e., the Color Fundus (CF). However, multi-modality retinal images are used every day in the study of the retina and diagnosis of retinal diseases, and the study of vessel segmentation on other modalities is scarce; (2) Even though a few works extended their experiments to new modalities such as the Multi-Color Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (MC), these works still require fine-tuning a separate model for the new modality. The fine-tuning will require extra training data, which is difficult to acquire. In this work, we present a novel universal vessel segmentation model (URVSM) for multi-modality retinal images. In addition to performing the study on a much wider range of image modalities, we also propose a universal model to segment the vessels in all these commonly used modalities. While being much more versatile compared with existing methods, our universal model also demonstrates comparable performance to the state-of-the-art fine-tuned methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that achieves modality-agnostic retinal vessel segmentation and the first to study retinal vessel segmentation in several novel modalities.

Abstract: Light emission from galaxies exhibit diverse brightness profiles, influenced by factors such as galaxy type, structural features and interactions with other galaxies. Elliptical galaxies feature more uniform light distributions, while spiral and irregular galaxies have complex, varied light profiles due to their structural heterogeneity and star-forming activity. In addition, galaxies with an active galactic nucleus (AGN) feature intense, concentrated emission from gas accretion around supermassive black holes, superimposed on regular galactic light, while quasi-stellar objects (QSO) are the extreme case of the AGN emission dominating the galaxy. The challenge of identifying AGN and QSO has been discussed many times in the literature, often requiring multi-wavelength observations. This paper introduces a novel approach to identify AGN and QSO from a single image. Diffusion models have been recently developed in the machine-learning literature to generate realistic-looking images of everyday objects. Utilising the spatial resolving power of the Euclid VIS images, we created a diffusion model trained on one million sources, without using any source pre-selection or labels. The model learns to reconstruct light distributions of normal galaxies, since the population is dominated by them. We condition the prediction of the central light distribution by masking the central few pixels of each source and reconstruct the light according to the diffusion model. We further use this prediction to identify sources that deviate from this profile by examining the reconstruction error of the few central pixels regenerated in each source's core. Our approach, solely using VIS imaging, features high completeness compared to traditional methods of AGN and QSO selection, including optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and X-rays.

Abstract: Prompt-based models have demonstrated impressive prompt-following capability at image editing tasks. However, the models still struggle with following detailed editing prompts or performing local edits. Specifically, global image quality often deteriorates immediately after a single editing step. To address these challenges, we introduce SPICE, a training-free workflow that accepts arbitrary resolutions and aspect ratios, accurately follows user requirements, and consistently improves image quality during more than 100 editing steps, while keeping the unedited regions intact. By synergizing the strengths of a base diffusion model and a Canny edge ControlNet model, SPICE robustly handles free-form editing instructions from the user. On a challenging realistic image-editing dataset, SPICE quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and is consistently preferred by human annotators. We release the workflow implementation for popular diffusion model Web UIs to support further research and artistic exploration.

Abstract: Shape measures have emerged as promising descriptors of white matter tractography, offering complementary insights into anatomical variability and associations with cognitive and clinical phenotypes. However, conventional methods for computing shape measures are computationally expensive and time-consuming for large-scale datasets due to reliance on voxel-based representations. We propose Tract2Shape, a novel multimodal deep learning framework that leverages geometric (point cloud) and scalar (tabular) features to predict ten white matter tractography shape measures. To enhance model efficiency, we utilize a dimensionality reduction algorithm for the model to predict five primary shape components. The model is trained and evaluated on two independently acquired datasets, the HCP-YA dataset, and the PPMI dataset. We evaluate the performance of Tract2Shape by training and testing it on the HCP-YA dataset and comparing the results with state-of-the-art models. To further assess its robustness and generalization ability, we also test Tract2Shape on the unseen PPMI dataset. Tract2Shape outperforms SOTA deep learning models across all ten shape measures, achieving the highest average Pearson's r and the lowest nMSE on the HCP-YA dataset. The ablation study shows that both multimodal input and PCA contribute to performance gains. On the unseen testing PPMI dataset, Tract2Shape maintains a high Pearson's r and low nMSE, demonstrating strong generalizability in cross-dataset evaluation. Tract2Shape enables fast, accurate, and generalizable prediction of white matter shape measures from tractography data, supporting scalable analysis across datasets. This framework lays a promising foundation for future large-scale white matter shape analysis.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language model (MLLM)-based web agents interact with webpage environments by generating actions based on screenshots of the webpages. In this work, we propose WebInject, a prompt injection attack that manipulates the webpage environment to induce a web agent to perform an attacker-specified action. Our attack adds a perturbation to the raw pixel values of the rendered webpage. After these perturbed pixels are mapped into a screenshot, the perturbation induces the web agent to perform the attacker-specified action. We formulate the task of finding the perturbation as an optimization problem. A key challenge in solving this problem is that the mapping between raw pixel values and screenshot is non-differentiable, making it difficult to backpropagate gradients to the perturbation. To overcome this, we train a neural network to approximate the mapping and apply projected gradient descent to solve the reformulated optimization problem. Extensive evaluation on multiple datasets shows that WebInject is highly effective and significantly outperforms baselines.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays an important role in various clinical applications; however, existing deep learning models face trade-offs between efficiency and accuracy. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) capture local details well but miss the global context, whereas transformers handle the global context but at a high computational cost. Recently, State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have shown potential for capturing long-range dependencies with linear complexity; however, their direct use in medical image segmentation remains limited due to incompatibility with image structures and autoregressive assumptions. To overcome these challenges, we propose SAMA-UNet, a novel U-shaped architecture that introduces two key innovations. First, the Self-Adaptive Mamba-like Aggregated Attention (SAMA) block adaptively integrates local and global features through dynamic attention weighting, enabling an efficient representation of complex anatomical patterns. Second, the causal resonance multi-scale module (CR-MSM) improves encoder-decoder interactions by adjusting feature resolution and causal dependencies across scales, enhancing the semantic alignment between low- and high-level features. Extensive experiments on MRI, CT, and endoscopy datasets demonstrate that SAMA-UNet consistently outperforms CNN, Transformer, and Mamba-based methods. It achieves 85.38% DSC and 87.82% NSD on BTCV, 92.16% and 96.54% on ACDC, 67.14% and 68.70% on EndoVis17, and 84.06% and 88.47% on ATLAS23, establishing new benchmarks across modalities. These results confirm the effectiveness of SAMA-UNet in combining efficiency and accuracy, making it a promising solution for real-world clinical segmentation tasks. The source code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: To address the computational and storage challenges posed by large-scale datasets in deep learning, dataset distillation has been proposed to synthesize a compact dataset that replaces the original while maintaining comparable model performance. Unlike optimization-based approaches that require costly bi-level optimization, distribution matching (DM) methods improve efficiency by aligning the distributions of synthetic and original data, thereby eliminating nested optimization. DM achieves high computational efficiency and has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing DM methods, constrained to Euclidean space, treat data as independent and identically distributed points, overlooking complex geometric and hierarchical relationships. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel hyperbolic dataset distillation method, termed HDD. Hyperbolic space, characterized by negative curvature and exponential volume growth with distance, naturally models hierarchical and tree-like structures. HDD embeds features extracted by a shallow network into the Lorentz hyperbolic space, where the discrepancy between synthetic and original data is measured by the hyperbolic (geodesic) distance between their centroids. By optimizing this distance, the hierarchical structure is explicitly integrated into the distillation process, guiding synthetic samples to gravitate towards the root-centric regions of the original data distribution while preserving their underlying geometric characteristics. Furthermore, we find that pruning in hyperbolic space requires only 20% of the distilled core set to retain model performance, while significantly improving training stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to incorporate the hyperbolic space into the dataset distillation process. The code is available at https://github.com/Guang000/HDD.

Abstract: Developing general-purpose navigation policies for unknown environments remains a core challenge in robotics. Most existing systems rely on task-specific neural networks and fixed information flows, limiting their generalizability. Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) offer a promising alternative by embedding human-like knowledge for reasoning and planning, but prior LVLM-robot integrations have largely depended on pre-mapped spaces, hard-coded representations, and rigid control logic. We introduce the Agentic Robotic Navigation Architecture (ARNA), a general-purpose framework that equips an LVLM-based agent with a library of perception, reasoning, and navigation tools drawn from modern robotic stacks. At runtime, the agent autonomously defines and executes task-specific workflows that iteratively query modules, reason over multimodal inputs, and select navigation actions. This agentic formulation enables robust navigation and reasoning in previously unmapped environments, offering a new perspective on robotic stack design. Evaluated in Habitat Lab on the HM-EQA benchmark, ARNA outperforms state-of-the-art EQA-specific approaches. Qualitative results on RxR and custom tasks further demonstrate its ability to generalize across a broad range of navigation challenges.

Abstract: Recent progress in large vision-language models has driven improvements in language-based semantic navigation, where an embodied agent must reach a target object described in natural language. Yet we still lack a clear, language-focused evaluation framework to test how well agents ground the words in their instructions. We address this gap by proposing LangNav, an open-vocabulary multi-object navigation dataset with natural language goal descriptions (e.g. 'go to the red short candle on the table') and corresponding fine-grained linguistic annotations (e.g., attributes: color=red, size=short; relations: support=on). These labels enable systematic evaluation of language understanding. To evaluate on this setting, we extend multi-object navigation task setting to Language-guided Multi-Object Navigation (LaMoN), where the agent must find a sequence of goals specified using language. Furthermore, we propose Multi-Layered Feature Map (MLFM), a novel method that builds a queryable, multi-layered semantic map from pretrained vision-language features and proves effective for reasoning over fine-grained attributes and spatial relations in goal descriptions. Experiments on LangNav show that MLFM outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot mapping-based navigation baselines.

Abstract: Modern neural networks are expected to simultaneously satisfy a host of desirable properties: accurate fitting to training data, generalization to unseen inputs, parameter and computational efficiency, and robustness to adversarial perturbations. While compressibility and robustness have each been studied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains elusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how different forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral compressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of compression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the representation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective perturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound, revealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\infty$ and $L_2$ robustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the vulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved - whether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics. Through empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm our theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities persist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the emergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a fundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and suggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and secure.

Abstract: We introduce Genie Envisioner (GE), a unified world foundation platform for robotic manipulation that integrates policy learning, evaluation, and simulation within a single video-generative framework. At its core, GE-Base is a large-scale, instruction-conditioned video diffusion model that captures the spatial, temporal, and semantic dynamics of real-world robotic interactions in a structured latent space. Built upon this foundation, GE-Act maps latent representations to executable action trajectories through a lightweight, flow-matching decoder, enabling precise and generalizable policy inference across diverse embodiments with minimal supervision. To support scalable evaluation and training, GE-Sim serves as an action-conditioned neural simulator, producing high-fidelity rollouts for closed-loop policy development. The platform is further equipped with EWMBench, a standardized benchmark suite measuring visual fidelity, physical consistency, and instruction-action alignment. Together, these components establish Genie Envisioner as a scalable and practical foundation for instruction-driven, general-purpose embodied intelligence. All code, models, and benchmarks will be released publicly.

Abstract: Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and fitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in real-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source heterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and user heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across individuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific information, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their real-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns latent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream predictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns. Specifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source heterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user heterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term physiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a discriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of real-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset, ParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that our model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%, respectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates their strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm the practical value of our model.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated success in enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities, but remains limited to single-turn interactions without tool integration. While recent Agentic Reinforcement Learning with Tool use (ARLT) approaches have emerged to address multi-turn tool interactions, existing works develop task-specific codebases that suffer from fragmentation, synchronous execution bottlenecks, and limited extensibility across domains. These inefficiencies hinder broader community adoption and algorithmic innovation. We introduce VerlTool, a unified and modular framework that addresses these limitations through systematic design principles. VerlTool provides four key contributions: (1) upstream alignment with VeRL ensuring compatibility and simplified maintenance, (2) unified tool management via standardized APIs supporting diverse modalities including code execution, search, SQL databases, and vision processing, (3) asynchronous rollout execution achieving near 2$\times$ speedup by eliminating synchronization bottlenecks, and (4) comprehensive evaluation demonstrating competitive performance across 6 ARLT domains. Our framework formalizes ARLT as multi-turn trajectories with multi-modal observation tokens (text/image/video), extending beyond single-turn RLVR paradigms. We train and evaluate models on mathematical reasoning, knowledge QA, SQL generation, visual reasoning, web search, and software engineering tasks, achieving results comparable to specialized systems while providing unified training infrastructure. The modular plugin architecture enables rapid tool integration requiring only lightweight Python definitions, significantly reducing development overhead and providing a scalable foundation for tool-augmented RL research. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/verl-tool.

Abstract: With the raid evolution of large language models and multimodal models, the mobile-agent landscape has proliferated without converging on the fundamental challenges. This paper identifies four core problems that should be solved for mobile agents to deliver practical, scalable impact: (1) generalization across tasks, APPs, and devices; (2) accuracy, specifically precise on-screen interaction and click targeting; (3) long-horizon capability for sustained, multi-step goals; and (4) efficiency, specifically high-performance runtime on resource-constrained devices. We present AppCopilot, a multimodal, multi-agent, general-purpose mobile agent that operates across applications. AppCopilot operationalizes this position through an end-to-end pipeline spanning data collection, training, finetuning, efficient inference, and PC/mobile application. At the model layer, it integrates multimodal foundation models with robust Chinese-English support. At the reasoning and control layer, it combines chain-of-thought reasoning, hierarchical task planning and decomposition, and multi-agent collaboration. At the execution layer, it enables experiential adaptation, voice interaction, function calling, cross-APP and cross-device orchestration, and comprehensive mobile APP support. The system design incorporates profiling-driven optimization for latency and memory across heterogeneous hardware. Empirically, AppCopilot achieves significant improvements on four dimensions: stronger generalization, higher precision of on screen actions, more reliable long horizon task completion, and faster, more resource efficient runtime. By articulating a cohesive position and a reference architecture that closes the loop from data collection, training to finetuning and efficient inference, this paper offers a concrete roadmap for general purpose mobile agent and provides actionable guidance.

Abstract: We present a solution for the MIDOG 2025 Challenge Track~2, addressing binary classification of normal mitotic figures (NMFs) versus atypical mitotic figures (AMFs). The approach leverages pathology-specific foundation model H-optimus-0, selected based on recent cross-domain generalization benchmarks and our empirical testing, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning and MixUp augmentation. Implementation includes soft labels based on multi-expert consensus, hard negative mining, and adaptive focal loss, metric learning and domain adaptation. The method demonstrates both the promise and challenges of applying foundation models to this complex classification task, achieving reasonable performance in the preliminary evaluation phase.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific "forget" data from a trained model while preserving its knowledge of the remaining "retain" data. Existing MU methods based on label manipulation or model weight perturbations often achieve limited unlearning effectiveness. To address this, we introduce CoUn, a novel MU framework inspired by the observation that a model retrained from scratch using only retain data classifies forget data based on their semantic similarity to the retain data. CoUn emulates this behavior by adjusting learned data representations through contrastive learning (CL) and supervised learning, applied exclusively to retain data. Specifically, CoUn (1) leverages semantic similarity between data samples to indirectly adjust forget representations using CL, and (2) maintains retain representations within their respective clusters through supervised learning. Extensive experiments across various datasets and model architectures show that CoUn consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MU baselines in unlearning effectiveness. Additionally, integrating our CL module into existing baselines empowers their unlearning effectiveness.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in radiology by integrating visual perception with natural language understanding. However, they often generate clinically unsupported descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Decoding (CCD), a training-free and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing 3D scenes with high detail on objects of interest. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by $\approx 17\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a single object of interest, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving synthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records, supporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing downstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent (SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients, slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates, specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients, accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets, yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.

<div> Keywords: uLDCT, denoising, Image Purification, Frequency-domain Flow Matching, anatomical structure preservation

Summary:
Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) imaging reduces radiation exposure but introduces noise and spatial misalignment. Existing denoising methods struggle with this challenge, as they are trained on synthetic data or aligned images. This study proposes an Image Purification (IP) strategy to address the data mismatch problem. By generating structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, the IP strategy improves the quality of data for denoising network training. Additionally, a Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model is introduced to preserve anatomical structures in denoised images. Experimental results on a real clinical dataset demonstrate that the IP strategy enhances the performance of denoising models and the FFM model combined with IP achieves state-of-the-art results in anatomical structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution for denoising real-world uLDCT images. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/flow-matching.

Summary: 
Ctrl-VI is a video synthesis method that allows for varying levels of user control in generating diverse and controllable video samples. The approach leverages variational inference to approximate a composed distribution, incorporating multiple video generation backbones to meet task constraints effectively. By minimizing KL divergence step-wise over annealed distributions and utilizing context-conditioned factorization to reduce solution space modes, the method produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency compared to existing models. The results of experiments demonstrate the efficacy of Ctrl-VI in addressing the need for flexibility in video workflows and enhancing the quality of generated video content. <div>

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed input formats. We develop Ctrl-VI, a video synthesis method that addresses this need and generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency compared to prior works.

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with 4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene understanding.

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control, then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B parameters.

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments. Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained. The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially in few-shot learning scenarios.

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance. However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430 patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261 slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions for prostate cancer patients.

<div> Keywords: Adversarial purification, non-additive perturbations, image classification, NAPPure, robustness

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces NAPPure, an extended adversarial purification framework designed to combat non-additive perturbations in image classification models. Traditional methods focus on additive perturbations but struggle with non-additive ones like blur and distortion. NAPPure disentangles clean images from perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization, enhancing model robustness. Experimental results on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of NAPPure, significantly improving performance against non-additive perturbations. This novel approach not only addresses common real-world perturbations but also offers a promising solution for enhancing the robustness of image classification models in various scenarios. NAPPure's ability to handle non-additive perturbations marks a significant advancement in the field of adversarial purification. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However, non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.14032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs); however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs, which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips, resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available at https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/Vgent.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Temporal Prototype Learning (TPL) as a framework for synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from different scenes or generative AI videos. TPL constructs a shared 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings obtained from pretrained models, allowing for robust alignment of videos without exhaustive pairwise matching. This approach improves synchronization accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. TPL is the first method to address synchronization challenges in multiple generative AI videos depicting the same action. The framework is available for use and is accompanied by a new multiple video synchronization dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the complexities of synchronizing videos with diverse subjects and backgrounds. <div>

Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts. However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently, generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared, compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/

This new research introduces a zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic 3D avatars that maintain the identity of the individual using only a few unstructured phone images. The method addresses challenges faced by existing approaches, such as geometric inconsistencies and lack of high-frequency details. The key contributions of this method are a generative canonicalization module that standardizes multiple unstructured views and a transformer-based model trained on a large-scale dataset of high-fidelity avatars.

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic, identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This "Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured photos.

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration, lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM. cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods, enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis workflows. cubic is openly available at https://github$.$com/alxndrkalinin/cubic

<div> Keywords: joint modeling, Big Five, HEXACO, multimodal behavior, personality traits

Summary:
Joint modeling of the Big Five and HEXACO for recognizing personality traits from multimodal human behavior is proposed in this paper. While previous studies have focused on the Big Five for personality trait recognition, the inclusion of HEXACO traits such as Honesty-Humility and social dominance orientation adds new dimensions. The relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO in machine learning models have not been well-understood, making this research significant for enhancing the understanding of apparent personality traits. The proposed method optimizes the recognition of both the Big Five and HEXACO traits, showing effectiveness in experiments with a self-introduction video dataset. This advancement can lead to improved awareness of human behavior by considering the joint modeling of these personality trait dimensions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology, for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

Summary:
The study introduces a novel method for distinguishing between AI-generated images and real ones by leveraging bit-plane-based image processing. This approach refines error extraction, captures noise patterns, and utilizes image normalization techniques for noise amplification. A maximum gradient patch selection technique is employed to compute noise scores and identify regions with the highest noise levels, contributing to more effective noise-based and noise-guided classification. Experimental results on the GenImage benchmark showcase the method's outstanding performance, achieving an average accuracy of 98.9% and demonstrating strong cross-generator generalization. The method showcases high accuracy from GAN to Diffusion and vice versa, performing error extraction at a significantly faster rate compared to existing approaches, with a nearly hundredfold increase in speed. The code for the method is publicly available on GitHub for further validation and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.14230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%} (\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.

<div> Keywords: deepfakes, manipulated media, detection methods, advanced generative models, multimodal framework 

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges posed by manipulated media, particularly deepfakes, and the limitations of conventional detection methods. These methods often fail to identify deepfakes generated by advanced models like GANs and neural rendering techniques due to their ability to create nearly perfect individual frames with minor temporal discrepancies. The authors propose a novel multimodal audio-visual framework called PIA (Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic Analysis) to enhance deepfake detection. PIA utilizes phoneme sequences, lip geometry data, and facial identity embeddings to identify inconsistencies across multiple modalities, improving the detection of subtle deepfake alterations. By incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial identification cues, PIA offers a more comprehensive approach to deepfake detection, addressing the challenges posed by modern-day manipulated media. The code for PIA is available on GitHub for further exploration and research purposes. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.14241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences, lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities.

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge, no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme, called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over 10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces the Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE) to address challenges in efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes. Inspired by MOE, MACE uses a gating network to select sub-networks and employs an Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing strategy for improved accuracy. By activating only one sub-network during inference, MACE reduces computational costs while maintaining precision. Experiments on the Cambridge test set show MACE achieving high-quality rendering results in just 10 minutes of training. <div>

Abstract: Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes. Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks, ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference. Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.

<div> identity preservation, video generation, Reinforcement learning, facial scoring, optimization 

Summary:<br /><br />A novel Identity-Preserving Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO) framework based on reinforcement learning is proposed to improve human-centric video generation by enhancing identity preservation. This approach optimizes diffusion models using a face identity scorer without altering model architectures. The method includes a facial scoring mechanism using ground-truth videos as facial feature pools to enhance generalization. Backpropagation of rewards through the sampling chain improves performance and accelerates convergence. A KL-divergence regularization helps stabilize training and prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on existing and in-house I2V models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showcasing significant improvements in maintaining identity consistency in generated videos. The project and code are available for further exploration and implementation. <div>
arXiv:2510.14255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.

<div> matchattention, cross-view matching, high-resolution images, stereo matching, real-time inference <br />
Summary:
Cross-view matching often faces challenges in handling high-resolution images due to quadratic complexity and lack of matching constraints in existing cross-attention mechanisms. This paper introduces MatchAttention, an attention mechanism that dynamically matches relative positions to overcome these hurdles. By utilizing BilinearSoftmax for continuous and differentiable attention sampling, MatchAttention embeds relative positions into feature channels through residual connections across layers. To enhance performance on stereo matching and mitigate cross-view occlusions, a hierarchical cross-view decoder, MatchDecoder, along with gated cross-MatchAttention and a consistency-constrained loss are proposed. The proposed MatchStereo-B and MatchStereo-T models rank first in accuracy on the Middlebury benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art results on various datasets with high efficiency. Real-time, high-resolution, and accurate cross-view matching is made achievable by combining high accuracy with low computational complexity. <div>

Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism, MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component. To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference. MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and high-accuracy cross-view matching possible.

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision, with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges 2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes. Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches, highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either approach alone.

Abstract: Domain shift in histopathology, often caused by differences in acquisition processes or data sources, poses a major challenge to the generalization ability of deep learning models. Existing methods primarily rely on modeling statistical correlations by aligning feature distributions or introducing statistical variation, yet they often overlook causal relationships. In this work, we propose a novel causal-inference-based framework that leverages semantic features while mitigating the impact of confounders. Our method implements the front-door principle by designing transformation strategies that explicitly incorporate mediators and observed tissue slides. We validate our method on the CAMELYON17 dataset and a private histopathology dataset, demonstrating consistent performance gains across unseen domains. As a result, our approach achieved up to a 7% improvement in both the CAMELYON17 dataset and the private histopathology dataset, outperforming existing baselines. These results highlight the potential of causal inference as a powerful tool for addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.

Summary: 
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown promising results in multimodal tasks but are prone to hallucinations. The proposed approach involves a training-free tri-layer contrastive decoding with watermarking. This method focuses on selecting decoding layers, identifying a visually well-grounded pivot layer using watermark-related questions, and applying tri-layer contrastive decoding to reduce hallucinations. Experiments on public benchmarks POPE, MME, and AMBER demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generating more visually grounded responses. The approach addresses the reliance on a single modality and the memorization of training data, providing a solution to improve the robustness and reliability of LVLMs.

arXiv:2510.14304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1) select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2) identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE, MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded responses.

Summary:<br />
An iris biometric system can be vulnerable to presentation attacks (PAs) using artifacts like artificial eyes or printed eye images. To address this, various presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, the scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques poses a challenge. The Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN (MID-StyleGAN) framework is introduced to generate synthetic ocular images capturing both bonafide and PA characteristics across multiple domains. MID-StyleGAN combines diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce realistic synthetic data for enhancing PAD systems' performance. By utilizing a multi-domain architecture and adaptive loss function, MID-StyleGAN surpasses existing methods in generating high-quality ocular images. Experimental results on the LivDet2020 dataset show a significant improvement in true detection rate at low false detection rates, illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs) where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this, we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN (MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed method.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However, mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs, thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs. Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces the Spatial Preference Rewarding (SPR) approach to enhance the spatial capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MLLMs have shown promise in spatial understanding but lack fine-grained perception abilities. SPR rewards MLLMs for generating detailed responses with accurate object localization, improving their spatial understanding. By evaluating text quality and localization accuracy in MLLM-generated descriptions, SPR refines the descriptions to enhance alignment with visual input. Through experiments on standard benchmarks, SPR proves to be effective in improving MLLM spatial capabilities with minimal training overhead. The approach addresses the limitation of MLLMs in generating detailed region descriptions and accurately localizing objects, ultimately enhancing their spatial perception abilities. <div>
arXiv:2510.14374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with minimal overhead in training.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks. These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving multi-object image generation.

Summary:
DRBD-Mamba is proposed as an efficient 3D brain tumor segmentation model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal computational overhead. It utilizes a space-filling curve to map 3D features to 1D, reducing the need for computationally expensive multi-axial scans.

Evaluations on five systematic BraTS2023 folds show improved segmentation accuracy over existing state-of-the-art methods, with 0.10% Dice improvement for whole tumor, 1.75% for tumor core, and 0.93% for enhancing tumor on the test set. The model maintains competitive accuracy for whole tumor while achieving average Dice gains of 0.86% for tumor core and 1.45% for enhancing tumor. It also demonstrates a 15 times efficiency improvement, highlighting its robustness and computational advantage. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions. Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance. However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the 20\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of 0.10\% for whole tumor, 1.75\% for tumor core, and 0.93\% for enhancing tumor. Evaluations on the proposed systematic five folds demonstrate that our model maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice gains of 0.86\% for tumor core and 1.45\% for enhancing tumor over existing state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our model attains 15 times improvement in efficiency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its robustness and computational advantage over existing approaches.

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work, we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble, Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes, highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard manufacturing.

By transforming gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions, DCMIL outperforms standard prognostic models across twelve cancer types. The model also identifies prognosis-salient regions, provides robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences between normal and tumor tissues. The findings suggest the potential for generating new biological insights in cancer research. All codes for the DCMIL model are publicly accessible on GitHub for further exploration.

Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles) demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models. Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological insights.

<div> Keywords: Neural video compression, DCVC-RT, intra and inter coding, interframe redundancy, real-time encoding/decoding

Summary: 
An advanced Neural Video Compression (NVC) framework is introduced, addressing limitations of existing schemes such as disocclusion handling and interframe error propagation. By incorporating intra coding within inter-coded frames, the new framework efficiently manages new content and error propagation without manual intervention. The unified intra and inter coding model adapts for each frame, enhancing compression efficiency. Additionally, a simultaneous two-frame compression design optimizes interframe redundancy in both directions. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over DCVC-RT with a 10.7% average BD-rate reduction, stable bitrate, and quality per frame, all while maintaining real-time encoding/decoding capabilities. Code and models will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations, including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled, disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding, where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and models will be released.

Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly those involving universal perturbations.

<title>Unsupervised Deep Generative Models for Anomaly Detection in Neuroimaging: A Systematic Scoping Review</title>

<div> Keywords: unsupervised deep generative models, anomaly detection, neuroimaging, brain MRI, semi-supervised learning <br />
Summary: Unsupervised deep generative models are showing promise in detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging without the need for large annotated datasets. These models can identify anomalies by learning normative brain structures and detecting deviations. A scoping review of 49 studies between 2018-2025 found that generative models, including autoencoders and GANs, performed well in detecting large focal lesions and subtle abnormalities in brain MRI and occasionally in CT scans. They are particularly useful in rare or heterogeneous diseases with limited annotated data. The pseudo-healthy reconstructions produced by these models are interpretable, aiding in anomaly detection. The future focus should be on anatomy-aware modeling, developing foundation models, appropriate evaluation metrics, and thorough clinical validation to realize the clinical impact of these models. Semi-supervised learning, novel imaging biomarker discovery, and within- and cross-disease deviation mapping are potential areas for future research in the field of anomaly detection in neuroimaging. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.14462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging. Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49 studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours, stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual) reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce, as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning, supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within- and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling, development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and rigorous clinical validation.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a strategy for compressing multi-task image restoration models to improve computational efficiency. The proposed model, MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning approach to identify highly sparse subnetworks within deep models. By removing low-magnitude weights and resetting the remaining ones, MIR-L effectively unveils "winning tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity levels. Experimental results on deraining, dehazing, and denoising tasks demonstrate that MIR-L retains only 10% of the trainable parameters while delivering high-quality image restoration. The code, datasets, and pre-trained models are available on GitHub for further exploration and application. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Image quality is a critical factor in delivering visually appealing content on web platforms. However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters, making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining, dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at https://github.com/Thomkat/MIR-L.

Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made publicly available.

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically, a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time, a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of ViTs.

<title>Noise Projection: Closing the Prompt-Agnostic Gap Behind Text-to-Image Misalignment in Diffusion Models</title>

<div> Keywords: text-to-image generation, noise projection, denoising paths, vision-language model, prompt-specific subset<br />
<br />
Summary: 
This paper addresses the issue of misalignment between generated images and text prompts in text-to-image generation models. The proposed solution involves using a noise projector that refines initial noises based on prompt embeddings before denoising. This approach bridges the training-inference gap by ensuring that the noise used during inference aligns better with the prompt-specific latent space observed during training. The framework includes sampling noises, obtaining feedback from a vision-language model, training a reward model, and optimizing the noise projector. By incorporating prompt-aware noise projection, the method enhances text-image alignment without the need for reference images or handcrafted priors. Additionally, it reduces the inference cost by replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of prompt-aware noise projection in improving text-image alignment across various prompts. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.14526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection. In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch: during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising. Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training, without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

Abstract: Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design, and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM, the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry. DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases, imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation. Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised, self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable. DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address critical gaps in global oral healthcare.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new framework, PL-SE-ADA, for domain harmonization and interpretable representation learning in medical images like MR scans. The framework aims to address issues related to domain shifts across imaging sites that affect machine learning performance in disease classification. PL-SE-ADA utilizes two encoders to extract domain-invariant and domain-specific latent spaces, a decoder for image reconstruction, and a domain predictor. Through adversarial training and image reconstruction, the model ensures both harmonization and informativeness in brain MR images. Results show that PL-SE-ADA outperforms previous methods in image reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition while maintaining high interpretability. The framework allows visualization of domain-independent brain features and domain-specific components, providing insights into the underlying data structure and enhancing the overall understanding of the medical images.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.14535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images $\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images. PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image $f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image $\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the VisualSplit framework, aimed at exploring efficient image representations by combining classical visual descriptors with modern learning techniques. While deep learning has advanced image understanding, its opaque internal representations pose challenges in interpretation. VisualSplit decomposes images into classical descriptors like edge and color, treating them as independent components for better interpretability. Through a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, the framework learns to capture the essence of each descriptor while maintaining interpretability. By explicitly decomposing visual attributes, VisualSplit enables effective attribute control in advanced visual tasks such as image generation and editing, beyond traditional tasks like classification and segmentation. The method's effectiveness in enhancing visual understanding is demonstrated through its project page and experimental results on various visual tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.14536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge, colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for visual understanding.

<div> alignment, features, cross-modal, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, multi-step adjustment

Summary:
- The paper addresses the challenge of aligning features from different modalities for cross-modal tasks.
- Current parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods only perform one-step adjustment, which may be insufficient for complex datasets with highly entangled features.
- The proposed Flow Matching Alignment (FMA) approach is a model-agnostic multi-step adjustment method that learns a cross-modal velocity field.
- FMA utilizes fixed coupling and noise augmentation strategies to ensure category correspondence and address data scarcity.
- An early-stopping solver in FMA terminates the transformation process early, improving efficiency and accuracy. 
- Results show that FMA outperforms one-step PEFT methods, achieving more precise and robust alignment across various benchmarks and backbones, especially on challenging datasets.

Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on challenging datasets.

<div> Identity shift, text-to-image generation, scene contextualization, scene de-contextualization, identity preservation

Summary:
This paper addresses the issue of identity shift in consistent text-to-image generation models, which often struggle to produce identity-preserving images across different scenes. The authors identify scene contextualization as a key factor contributing to identity shift, showing its near-universality and deriving theoretical bounds on its strength. They propose a novel approach called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC) that effectively removes the scene-ID correlation within the ID prompt's embedding without requiring prior knowledge of target scenes. SDeC enhances identity preservation while maintaining scene diversity, making it a flexible and practical solution for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SDeC in improving T2I generation performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.14553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes. This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces BalanceGS, an algorithm-system co-design for efficient training in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). It addresses the inefficiencies in the traditional 3DGS training pipeline by proposing heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to balance point distributions, dynamic workload distribution through Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, and a reordering-based memory access mapping strategy for improved memory access. Experimental results show that BalanceGS achieves a 1.44x training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with minimal quality degradation compared to 3DGS. <div>
arXiv:2510.14564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting. Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible quality degradation.

Abstract: This paper presents CALM-Net, a curvature-aware LiDAR point cloud-based multi-branch neural network for vehicle re-identification. The proposed model addresses the challenge of learning discriminative and complementary features from three-dimensional point clouds to distinguish between vehicles.

<div> Keywords: vision-language models, pixel-level grounding, keypoint comprehension, Point Descriptor, Point Localizer

Summary:
Vision-language models have seen success in cross-modal understanding but have lacked the ability to comprehend keypoints at the pixel level through natural language. A new framework for pixel-level grounding is introduced, consisting of a Point Descriptor for generating detailed keypoint descriptions and a Point Localizer for determining precise pixel coordinates from these descriptions. The approach allows for free-form and contextual keypoint descriptions, enhancing keypoint comprehension. A dataset called LlamaPointInPart is created to train the system, capturing multi-scale information and enabling cross-category generalization. The Point Descriptor is optimized using AP-10K via GRPO, with the Point Localizer as a reward model. Evaluation is done using a new protocol based on localization accuracy, showing superior performance compared to baseline models. The bidirectional framework opens up possibilities for keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided localization. The code and dataset are available publicly.

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional nature of our framework should enable future applications in both keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/matanr/Talking_Points.

<div> Instance Cues, Motion Generation, Video Generation, Dense RoPE, STANCE

Summary:
The article introduces STANCE, a framework for image-to-video generation that addresses challenges in maintaining coherent object motion and interactions. It tackles the issue of sparse motion hints provided by humans collapsing to too few effective tokens by introducing Instance Cues, which turn these hints into a dense 2.5D motion field. This method reduces depth ambiguity and improves guidance while remaining user-friendly. Additionally, the model utilizes Dense RoPE to preserve the salience of motion cues in token space, anchoring structure and improving temporal coherence. By incorporating joint RGB and auxiliary-map prediction, STANCE optimizes for appearance and motion separately, stabilizing optimization and enhancing overall video quality without the need for per-frame trajectory scripts. <div>
arXiv:2510.14588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps) often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance; and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse, user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB \(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

Abstract: State-of-the-art animal classification models like SpeciesNet provide predictions across thousands of species but use conservative rollup strategies, resulting in many animals labeled at high taxonomic levels rather than species. We present a hierarchical re-classification system for the Animal Detect platform that combines SpeciesNet EfficientNetV2-M predictions with CLIP embeddings and metric learning to refine high-level taxonomic labels toward species-level identification. Our five-stage pipeline (high-confidence acceptance, bird override, centroid building, triplet-loss metric learning, and adaptive cosine-distance scoring) is evaluated on a segment of the LILA BC Desert Lion Conservation dataset (4,018 images, 15,031 detections). After recovering 761 bird detections from "blank" and "animal" labels, we re-classify 456 detections labeled animal, mammal, or blank with 96.5% accuracy, achieving species-level identification for 64.9 percent

Abstract: Camera traps generate millions of wildlife images, yet many datasets contain species that are absent from existing classifiers. This work evaluates zero-shot approaches for organizing unlabeled wildlife imagery using self-supervised vision transformers, developed and tested within the Animal Detect platform for camera trap analysis. We compare unsupervised clustering methods (DBSCAN, GMM) across three architectures (CLIP, DINOv2, MegaDescriptor) combined with dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, UMAP), and we demonstrate continuous 1D similarity ordering via t-SNE projection. On a 5-species test set with ground truth labels used only for evaluation, DINOv2 with UMAP and GMM achieves 88.6 percent accuracy (macro-F1 = 0.874), while 1D sorting reaches 88.2 percent coherence for mammals and birds and 95.2 percent for fish across 1,500 images. Based on these findings, we deployed continuous similarity ordering in production, enabling rapid exploratory analysis and accelerating manual annotation workflows for biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Tactical understanding in badminton involves interpreting not only individual actions but also how tactics are dynamically executed over time. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions. Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic captioning.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.14624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling (EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity, requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

arXiv:2510.14630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective. This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs. Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for efficient generative modeling.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA, an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality. Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence. Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data, confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations. Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

<title>WeCKD: Weakly-supervised Chained Distillation Network for Efficient Multimodal Medical Imaging</title>

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain, where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project page: https://vtimecot.github.io

<title>Leveraging Learned Image Prior for 3D Gaussian Compression</title>

Abstract: Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful representational capacity of learned image priors to recover compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of 90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to 99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open sourced this pipeline at https://github.com/microsoft/whales.

Abstract: Camera movement conveys spatial and narrative information essential for understanding video content. While recent camera movement classification (CMC) methods perform well on modern datasets, their generalization to historical footage remains unexplored. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of deep video CMC models on archival film material. We summarize representative methods and datasets, highlighting differences in model design and label definitions. Five standard video classification models are assessed on the HISTORIAN dataset, which includes expert-annotated World War II footage. The best-performing model, Video Swin Transformer, achieves 80.25% accuracy, showing strong convergence despite limited training data. Our findings highlight the challenges and potential of adapting existing models to low-quality video and motivate future work combining diverse input modalities and temporal architectures.

<title>Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module for Multi-Scale Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module (CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance, achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO (vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy, but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic, mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These, along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical classification under real-world constraints.

arXiv:2510.14741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting. Code is available at https://github.com/perceivelab/dexter.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks, such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE) and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns, which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down), horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right, representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption, and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV communication in constrained environments.

<title>CoT-PL: Visual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Meets Pseudo-Labeling for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.14792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings, our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4% and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9 mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally, with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior, therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%; HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens, replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between treatments.

<title>Scaling Artificial Intelligence for Multi-Tumor Early Detection with More Reports, Fewer Masks</title>

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence (AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly, requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%, surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably, R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate, bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor types.
  We plan to release our trained models, code, and dataset at https://github.com/MrGiovanni/R-Super

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight: treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit \textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions. Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5 downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj. Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PRTraj.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4 bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana, \pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).

<title>Scaling Tumor Segmentation: Best Lessons from Real and Synthetic Data</title>

Abstract: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data, we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130 tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver, kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23 expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs. It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential 3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder, enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video generation.

<title>A Multi-Task Deep Learning Framework for Skin Lesion Classification, ABCDE Feature Quantification, and Evolution Simulation</title>

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A, B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall, this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of skin cancer progression.

Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans, languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text -> sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work, we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition, offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in the project page.

<title>TOUCH: Text-guided Controllable Generation of Free-Form Hand-Object Interactions</title>

arXiv:2510.14874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent. Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language. Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing, poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse, and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

Abstract: Existing collision prediction methods often fail to distinguish between ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment. We present BADAS, a family of collision prediction models trained on Nexar's real-world dashcam collision dataset -- the first benchmark designed explicitly for ego-centric evaluation. We re-annotate major benchmarks to identify ego involvement, add consensus alert-time labels, and synthesize negatives where needed, enabling fair AP/AUC and temporal evaluation. BADAS uses a V-JEPA2 backbone trained end-to-end and comes in two variants: BADAS-Open (trained on our 1.5k public videos) and BADAS1.0 (trained on 40k proprietary videos). Across DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, and Nexar, BADAS achieves state-of-the-art AP/AUC and outperforms a forward-collision ADAS baseline while producing more realistic time-to-accident estimates. We release our BADAS-Open model weights and code, along with re-annotations of all evaluation datasets to promote ego-centric collision prediction research.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency. While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information. Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

arXiv:2510.14885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge. Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings, we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural language.

<title>Leveraging Multimodal LLM Descriptions of Activity for Explainable Semi-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.14896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level, our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets without interaction anomalies.

Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting, tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language. Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are available at https://www.gabriel.fiastre.fr/maskcaptioner/.

<title>3D Scene Prompting for Scene-Consistent Camera-Controllable Video Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.14945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality.

arXiv:2510.14954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges: creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer, where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization, we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance. The code of our method will be made public.

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization techniques.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity, strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing. Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project Page: https://mathcanvas.github.io/

arXiv:2510.14960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to 4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information, facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes. Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and point tracking.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.14962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder, adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion, thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex precipitation forecasting scenarios.

Abstract: Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding (3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that 3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point, we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target, and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications. Project page: https://hm123450.github.io/CGB/ .

arXiv:2510.14975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we (1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2) introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable generation.

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics, drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors, Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

<title>Terra: Explorable Native 3D World Model with Point Latents</title>

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction and generation with high 3D consistency.

<title>Learning an Image Editing Model without Image Editing Pairs</title>

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data, our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

Abstract: The edifice of native Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has emerged as a rising contender to typical modular VLMs, shaped by evolving model architectures and training paradigms. Yet, two lingering clouds cast shadows over its widespread exploration and promotion: (-) What fundamental constraints set native VLMs apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-) How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.

<title>Coupled Diffusion Sampling for Training-Free Multi-View Image Editing</title>

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for multi-view consistent editing.

<title>Towards Unified Multimodal Misinformation Detection in Social Media: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline</title>

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios, however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world multimodal deception detection.

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (MedVQA) enables natural language queries over medical images to support clinical decision-making and patient care. The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addressed wound-care VQA, requiring systems to generate free-text responses and structured wound attributes from images and patient queries. We present the MasonNLP system, which employs a general-domain, instruction-tuned large language model with a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that incorporates textual and visual examples from in-domain data. This approach grounds outputs in clinically relevant exemplars, improving reasoning, schema adherence, and response quality across dBLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and LLM-based metrics. Our best-performing system ranked 3rd among 19 teams and 51 submissions with an average score of 41.37%, demonstrating that lightweight RAG with general-purpose LLMs -- a minimal inference-time layer that adds a few relevant exemplars via simple indexing and fusion, with no extra training or complex re-ranking -- provides a simple and effective baseline for multimodal clinical NLP tasks.

<title>Self-Training with Dynamic Weighting for Robust Gradual Domain Adaptation</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation (GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$ (progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains. Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/Dramwig/STDW.

Abstract: Cellular image segmentation is essential for quantitative biology yet remains difficult due to heterogeneous modalities, morphological variability, and limited annotations. We present GenCellAgent, a training-free multi-agent framework that orchestrates specialist segmenters and generalist vision-language models via a planner-executor-evaluator loop (choose tool $\rightarrow$ run $\rightarrow$ quality-check) with long-term memory. The system (i) automatically routes images to the best tool, (ii) adapts on the fly using a few reference images when imaging conditions differ from what a tool expects, (iii) supports text-guided segmentation of organelles not covered by existing models, and (iv) commits expert edits to memory, enabling self-evolution and personalized workflows. Across four cell-segmentation benchmarks, this routing yields a 15.7\% mean accuracy gain over state-of-the-art baselines. On endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria from new datasets, GenCellAgent improves average IoU by 37.6\% over specialist models. It also segments novel objects such as the Golgi apparatus via iterative text-guided refinement, with light human correction further boosting performance. Together, these capabilities provide a practical path to robust, adaptable cellular image segmentation without retraining, while reducing annotation burden and matching user preferences.

Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining. Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters $\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually. Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data (data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9 percentage points in a data-free setting.

<title>Distributional Consistency Loss: Beyond Pointwise Data Terms in Inverse Problems</title>

Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing. Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal (regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity). Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements, often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses, and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional fidelity losses for inverse problems.

Abstract: Many network architectures exist for learning on meshes, yet their constructions entail delicate trade-offs between difficulty learning high-frequency features, insufficient receptive field, sensitivity to discretization, and inefficient computational overhead. Drawing from classic local-global approaches in mesh processing, we introduce PoissonNet, a novel neural architecture that overcomes all of these deficiencies by formulating a local-global learning scheme, which uses Poisson's equation as the primary mechanism for feature propagation. Our core network block is simple; we apply learned local feature transformations in the gradient domain of the mesh, then solve a Poisson system to propagate scalar feature updates across the surface globally. Our local-global learning framework preserves the features's full frequency spectrum and provides a truly global receptive field, while remaining agnostic to mesh triangulation. Our construction is efficient, requiring far less compute overhead than comparable methods, which enables scalability -- both in the size of our datasets, and the size of individual training samples. These qualities are validated on various experiments where, compared to previous intrinsic architectures, we attain state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation and parameterizing highly-detailed animated surfaces. Finally, as a central application of PoissonNet, we show its ability to learn deformations, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art architectures that learn on surfaces.

<title>Towards Reversible Model Merging For Low-rank Weights</title>

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model. Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed, recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed models by a significant margin.

Abstract: Domain adaptation methods aim to bridge the gap between datasets by enabling knowledge transfer across domains, reducing the need for additional expert annotations. However, many approaches struggle with reliability in the target domain, an issue particularly critical in medical image segmentation, where accuracy and anatomical validity are essential. This challenge is further exacerbated in spatio-temporal data, where the lack of temporal consistency can significantly degrade segmentation quality, and particularly in echocardiography, where the presence of artifacts and noise can further hinder segmentation performance. To address these issues, we present RL4Seg3D, an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 2D + time echocardiography segmentation. RL4Seg3D integrates novel reward functions and a fusion scheme to enhance key landmark precision in its segmentations while processing full-sized input videos. By leveraging reinforcement learning for image segmentation, our approach improves accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency while also providing, as a beneficial side effect, a robust uncertainty estimator, which can be used at test time to further enhance segmentation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on over 30,000 echocardiographic videos, showing that it outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques without the need for any labels on the target domain.

Abstract: Human-humanoid collaboration shows significant promise for applications in healthcare, domestic assistance, and manufacturing. While compliant robot-human collaboration has been extensively developed for robotic arms, enabling compliant human-humanoid collaboration remains largely unexplored due to humanoids' complex whole-body dynamics. In this paper, we propose a proprioception-only reinforcement learning approach, COLA, that combines leader and follower behaviors within a single policy. The model is trained in a closed-loop environment with dynamic object interactions to predict object motion patterns and human intentions implicitly, enabling compliant collaboration to maintain load balance through coordinated trajectory planning. We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulator and real-world experiments on collaborative carrying tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness, generalization, and robustness of our model across various terrains and objects. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our model reduces human effort by 24.7%. compared to baseline approaches while maintaining object stability. Real-world experiments validate robust collaborative carrying across different object types (boxes, desks, stretchers, etc.) and movement patterns (straight-line, turning, slope climbing). Human user studies with 23 participants confirm an average improvement of 27.4% compared to baseline models. Our method enables compliant human-humanoid collaborative carrying without requiring external sensors or complex interaction models, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Mammography, the current standard for breast cancer screening, has reduced sensitivity in women with dense breast tissue, contributing to missed or delayed diagnoses. Thermalytix, an AI-based thermal imaging modality, captures functional vascular and metabolic cues that may complement mammographic structural data. This study investigates whether a breast density-informed multi-modal AI framework can improve cancer detection by dynamically selecting the appropriate imaging modality based on breast tissue composition. A total of 324 women underwent both mammography and thermal imaging. Mammography images were analyzed using a multi-view deep learning model, while Thermalytix assessed thermal images through vascular and thermal radiomics. The proposed framework utilized Mammography AI for fatty breasts and Thermalytix AI for dense breasts, optimizing predictions based on tissue type. This multi-modal AI framework achieved a sensitivity of 94.55% (95% CI: 88.54-100) and specificity of 79.93% (95% CI: 75.14-84.71), outperforming standalone mammography AI (sensitivity 81.82%, specificity 86.25%) and Thermalytix AI (sensitivity 92.73%, specificity 75.46%). Importantly, the sensitivity of Mammography dropped significantly in dense breasts (67.86%) versus fatty breasts (96.30%), whereas Thermalytix AI maintained high and consistent sensitivity in both (92.59% and 92.86%, respectively). This demonstrates that a density-informed multi-modal AI framework can overcome key limitations of unimodal screening and deliver high performance across diverse breast compositions. The proposed framework is interpretable, low-cost, and easily deployable, offering a practical path to improving breast cancer screening outcomes in both high-resource and resource-limited settings.

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant, demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

Abstract: Recent research on motion generation has shown significant progress in generating semantically aligned motion with singular semantics. However, when employing these models to create composite sequences containing multiple semantically generated motion clips, they often struggle to preserve the continuity of motion dynamics at the transition boundaries between clips, resulting in awkward transitions and abrupt artifacts. To address these challenges, we present Compositional Phase Diffusion, which leverages the Semantic Phase Diffusion Module (SPDM) and Transitional Phase Diffusion Module (TPDM) to progressively incorporate semantic guidance and phase details from adjacent motion clips into the diffusion process. Specifically, SPDM and TPDM operate within the latent motion frequency domain established by the pre-trained Action-Centric Motion Phase Autoencoder (ACT-PAE). This allows them to learn semantically important and transition-aware phase information from variable-length motion clips during training. Experimental results demonstrate the competitive performance of our proposed framework in generating compositional motion sequences that align semantically with the input conditions, while preserving phase transitional continuity between preceding and succeeding motion clips. Additionally, motion inbetweening task is made possible by keeping the phase parameter of the input motion sequences fixed throughout the diffusion process, showcasing the potential for extending the proposed framework to accommodate various application scenarios.

<title>GOPLA: Generalizable Object Placement Learning via Synthetic Augmentation of Human Arrangement</title>

Abstract: Robots are expected to serve as intelligent assistants, helping humans with everyday household organization. A central challenge in this setting is the task of object placement, which requires reasoning about both semantic preferences (e.g., common-sense object relations) and geometric feasibility (e.g., collision avoidance). We present GOPLA, a hierarchical framework that learns generalizable object placement from augmented human demonstrations. A multi-modal large language model translates human instructions and visual inputs into structured plans that specify pairwise object relationships. These plans are then converted into 3D affordance maps with geometric common sense by a spatial mapper, while a diffusion-based planner generates placement poses guided by test-time costs, considering multi-plan distributions and collision avoidance. To overcome data scarcity, we introduce a scalable pipeline that expands human placement demonstrations into diverse synthetic training data. Extensive experiments show that our approach improves placement success rates by 30.04 percentage points over the runner-up, evaluated on positioning accuracy and physical plausibility, demonstrating strong generalization across a wide range of real-world robotic placement scenarios.

<title>Supervised Fine-Tuning or Contrastive Learning? Towards Better Multimodal LLM Reranking</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14824</link>

Abstract: In information retrieval, training reranking models mainly focuses on two types of objectives: metric learning (e.g. contrastive loss to increase the predicted scores on relevant query-document pairs) and classification (binary label prediction of relevance vs. irrelevance). For BERT-style encoders, various studies have shown that contrastive learning (CL) can be more effective than discriminative (classification) learning. However, for large language models (LLMs), classification via supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which predicts ''yes'' (resp. ''no'') token for relevant (resp. irrelevant) pairs, appears more promising as it aligns well with the generative nature of LLMs. This divergence raises a central question: which objective is intrinsically better suited to LLM-based reranking, and what mechanism underlies the difference? In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison and analysis between CL and SFT for reranking, taking the universal multimodal retrieval (UMR) as the experimental playground. We first decompose the objectives into two components: weight, which controls the magnitude of those updates, and direction, which guides the model updates, then present a unified framework for understanding their interactions. Through probing experiments, we find that SFT provides a substantially stronger weighting scheme than CL, whereas the preferred scoring direction shows no clear winner. Taken together, these results point to a consistent advantage of SFT over CL for LLM reranking. To further validate our findings, we conduct large-scale training with SFT and present new state-of-the-art rerankers on the MRB benchmark. We also provide ablations on SFT settings and expect our findings to benefit future research and applications in this area.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety. Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks. This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space, finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement. Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present state-of-the-art defenses.

Abstract: Contact languages like English exhibit rich regional variations in the form of dialects, which are often used by dialect speakers interacting with generative models. However, can multimodal generative models effectively produce content given dialectal textual input? In this work, we study this question by constructing a new large-scale benchmark spanning six common English dialects. We work with dialect speakers to collect and verify over 4200 unique prompts and evaluate on 17 image and video generative models. Our automatic and human evaluation results show that current state-of-the-art multimodal generative models exhibit 32.26% to 48.17% performance degradation when a single dialect word is used in the prompt. Common mitigation methods such as fine-tuning and prompt rewriting can only improve dialect performance by small margins (< 7%), while potentially incurring significant performance degradation in Standard American English (SAE). To this end, we design a general encoder-based mitigation strategy for multimodal generative models. Our method teaches the model to recognize new dialect features while preserving SAE performance. Experiments on models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 show that our method is able to simultaneously raise performance on five dialects to be on par with SAE (+34.4%), while incurring near zero cost to SAE performance.

<title>From Language to Locomotion: Retargeting-free Humanoid Control via Motion Latent Guidance</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14952</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.14952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural language offers a natural interface for humanoid robots, but existing language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines remain cumbersome and unreliable. They typically decode human motion, retarget it to robot morphology, and then track it with a physics-based controller. However, this multi-stage process is prone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling between semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway from language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages. Therefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly conditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing explicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based policy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic intent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal transformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency while maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations for precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost substantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking accuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real humanoids. Beyond text, the framework naturally extends to other modalities such as images, audio, and music, providing a general foundation for vision-language-action humanoid systems.

<title>RDD: Retrieval-Based Demonstration Decomposer for Planner Alignment in Long-Horizon Tasks</title>

Abstract: To tackle long-horizon tasks, recent hierarchical vision-language-action (VLAs) frameworks employ vision-language model (VLM)-based planners to decompose complex manipulation tasks into simpler sub-tasks that low-level visuomotor policies can easily handle. Typically, the VLM planner is finetuned to learn to decompose a target task. This finetuning requires target task demonstrations segmented into sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic rules. However, the heuristic subtasks can deviate significantly from the training data of the visuomotor policy, which degrades task performance. To address these issues, we propose a Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer (RDD) that automatically decomposes demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning the visual features of the decomposed sub-task intervals with those from the training data of the low-level visuomotor policies. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art sub-task decomposer on both simulation and real-world tasks, demonstrating robustness across diverse settings. Code and more results are available at rdd-neurips.github.io.

<title>pi-Flow: Policy-Based Few-Step Generation via Imitation Distillation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14974</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.14974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep. The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while maintaining teacher-level quality.

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) in open-world settings presents a unique challenge: different applications rely on diverse sensor modalities, each with varying ground sampling distances, spectral ranges, and numbers of spectral bands. However, existing EO foundation models are typically tailored to specific sensor types, making them inflexible when generalizing across the heterogeneous landscape of EO data. To address this, we propose the Dynamic One-For-All (DOFA) model, a unified, multimodal foundation framework designed for diverse vision tasks in EO. Inspired by neural plasticity, DOFA utilizes a wavelength-conditioned dynamic hypernetwork to process inputs from five distinct satellite sensors flexibly. By continually pretraining on five EO modalities, DOFA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks and generalizes well to unseen modalities. Enhanced with hybrid continual pretraining, DOFA+ requires significantly fewer computational resources while outperforming counterparts trained with extensive GPU budgets. Experiments on diverse datasets highlight DOFA's potential as a foundation for general-purpose vision models in the sensor-diverse EO domain. The code and pre-trained weights are publicly available at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/DOFA.

Abstract: Open-world entity segmentation, as an emerging computer vision task, aims at segmenting entities in images without being restricted by pre-defined classes, offering impressive generalization capabilities on unseen images and concepts. Despite its promise, existing entity segmentation methods like Segment Anything Model (SAM) rely heavily on costly expert annotators. This work presents Self-supervised Open-world Hierarchical Entity Segmentation (SOHES), a novel approach that eliminates the need for human annotations. SOHES operates in three phases: self-exploration, self-instruction, and self-correction. Given a pre-trained self-supervised representation, we produce abundant high-quality pseudo-labels through visual feature clustering. Then, we train a segmentation model on the pseudo-labels, and rectify the noises in pseudo-labels via a teacher-student mutual-learning procedure. Beyond segmenting entities, SOHES also captures their constituent parts, providing a hierarchical understanding of visual entities. Using raw images as the sole training data, our method achieves unprecedented performance in self-supervised open-world segmentation, marking a significant milestone towards high-quality open-world entity segmentation in the absence of human-annotated masks.

Abstract: Recent studies of multimodal industrial anomaly detection (IAD) based on 3D point clouds and RGB images have highlighted the importance of exploiting the redundancy and complementarity among modalities for accurate classification and segmentation. However, achieving multimodal IAD in practical production lines remains a work in progress. It is essential to consider the trade-offs between the costs and benefits associated with the introduction of new modalities while ensuring compatibility with current processes. Existing quality control processes combine rapid in-line inspections, such as optical and infrared imaging with high-resolution but time-consuming near-line characterization techniques, including industrial CT and electron microscopy to manually or semi-automatically locate and analyze defects in the production of Li-ion batteries and composite materials. Given the cost and time limitations, only a subset of the samples can be inspected by all in-line and near-line methods, and the remaining samples are only evaluated through one or two forms of in-line inspection. To fully exploit data for deep learning-driven automatic defect detection, the models must have the ability to leverage multimodal training and handle incomplete modalities during inference. In this paper, we propose CMDIAD, a Cross-Modal Distillation framework for IAD to demonstrate the feasibility of a Multi-modal Training, Few-modal Inference (MTFI) pipeline. Our findings show that the MTFI pipeline can more effectively utilize incomplete multimodal information compared to applying only a single modality for training and inference. Moreover, we investigate the reasons behind the asymmetric performance improvement using point clouds or RGB images as the main modality of inference. This provides a foundation for our future multimodal dataset construction with additional modalities from manufacturing scenarios.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) customization empowers users to adapt the T2I diffusion model to new concepts absent in the pre-training dataset. On this basis, capturing multiple new concepts from a single image has emerged as a new task, allowing the model to learn multiple concepts simultaneously or discard unwanted concepts. However, multiple-concept disentanglement remains a key challenge. Existing disentanglement models often exhibit two main issues: feature fusion and asynchronous learning across different concepts. To address these issues, we propose AttenCraft, an attention-based method for multiple-concept disentanglement. Our method uses attention maps to generate accurate masks for each concept in a single initialization step, aiding in concept disentanglement without requiring mask preparation from humans or specialized models. Moreover, we introduce an adaptive algorithm based on attention scores to estimate sampling ratios for different concepts, promoting balanced feature acquisition and synchronized learning. AttenCraft also introduces a feature-retaining training framework that employs various loss functions to enhance feature recognition and prevent fusion. Extensive experiments show that our model effectively mitigates these two issues, achieving state-of-the-art image fidelity and comparable prompt fidelity to baseline models.

Abstract: In this thesis, we address the challenging problem of unpaired multi-view clustering (UMC), which aims to achieve effective joint clustering using unpaired samples observed across multiple views. Traditional incomplete multi-view clustering (IMC) methods typically rely on paired samples to capture complementary information between views. However, such strategies become impractical in the UMC due to the absence of paired samples. Although some researchers have attempted to address this issue by preserving consistent cluster structures across views, effectively mining such consistency remains challenging when the cluster structures {with low confidence}. Therefore, we propose a novel method, Multi-level Reliable Guidance for UMC (MRG-UMC), which integrates multi-level clustering and reliable view guidance to learn consistent and confident cluster structures from three perspectives. Specifically, inner-view multi-level clustering exploits high-confidence sample pairs across different levels to reduce the impact of boundary samples, resulting in more confident cluster structures. Synthesized-view alignment leverages a synthesized-view to mitigate cross-view discrepancies and promote consistency. Cross-view guidance employs a reliable view guidance strategy to enhance the clustering confidence of poorly clustered views. These three modules are jointly optimized across multiple levels to achieve consistent and confident cluster structures. Furthermore, theoretical analyses verify the effectiveness of MRG-UMC in enhancing clustering confidence. Extensive experimental results show that MRG-UMC outperforms state-of-the-art UMC methods, achieving an average NMI improvement of 12.95\% on multi-view datasets. {The source code is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/MRG-UMC-5E20.

Abstract: Monocular dynamic reconstruction is a challenging and long-standing vision problem due to the highly ill-posed nature of the task. Existing approaches depend on templates, are effective only in quasi-static scenes, or fail to model 3D motion explicitly. We introduce a method for reconstructing generic dynamic scenes, featuring explicit, persistent 3D motion trajectories in the world coordinate frame, from casually captured monocular videos. We tackle the problem with two key insights: First, we exploit the low-dimensional structure of 3D motion by representing scene motion with a compact set of SE(3) motion bases. Each point's motion is expressed as a linear combination of these bases, facilitating soft decomposition of the scene into multiple rigidly-moving groups. Second, we take advantage of off-the-shelf data-driven priors such as monocular depth maps and long-range 2D tracks, and devise a method to effectively consolidate these noisy supervisory signals, resulting in a globally consistent representation of the dynamic scene. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for both long-range 3D/2D motion estimation and novel view synthesis on dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have exhibited proficiencies across many visual tasks. Although numerous well-known benchmarks exist to evaluate model performance, they increasingly have insufficient headroom. As such, there is a pressing need for a new generation of benchmarks challenging enough for the next generation of LMMs. One area that LMMs show potential is graph analysis, specifically, the tasks an analyst might typically perform when interpreting figures such as estimating the mean, intercepts or correlations of functions and data series. In this work, we introduce GRAB, a graph analysis benchmark, fit for current and future frontier LMMs. Our benchmark is predominantly synthetic, ensuring high-quality, noise-free questions. GRAB is comprised of 3284 questions, covering five tasks and 23 graph properties. We evaluate 20 LMMs on GRAB, finding it to be a challenging benchmark, with the highest performing model attaining a score of just 21.0%. Finally, we conduct various ablations to investigate where the models succeed and struggle. We release GRAB and a lightweight GRAB-Lite to encourage progress in this important, growing domain.

Abstract: Recently, traffic sign recognition (TSR) systems have become a prominent target for physical adversarial attacks. These attacks typically rely on conspicuous stickers and projections, or using invisible light and acoustic signals that can be easily blocked. In this paper, we introduce a novel attack medium, i.e., fluorescent ink, to design a stealthy and effective physical adversarial patch, namely FIPatch, to advance the state-of-the-art. Specifically, we first model the fluorescence effect in the digital domain to identify the optimal attack settings, which guide the real-world fluorescence parameters. By applying a carefully designed fluorescence perturbation to the target sign, the attacker can later trigger a fluorescent effect using invisible ultraviolet light, causing the TSR system to misclassify the sign and potentially leading to traffic accidents. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation to investigate the effectiveness of FIPatch, which shows a success rate of 98.31% in low-light conditions. Furthermore, our attack successfully bypasses five popular defenses and achieves a success rate of 96.72%.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that regularization techniques using soft labels, e.g., label smoothing, Mixup, and CutMix, not only enhance image classification accuracy but also mitigate miscalibration due to overconfident predictions, and improve robustness against adversarial attacks. However, the underlying mechanisms of such improvements remain underexplored. In this paper, we offer a novel explanation from the perspective of the representation space (i.e., the space of the features obtained at the penultimate layer). Based on examination of decision boundaries and structure of features (or representation vectors), our study investigates confidence contours and gradient directions within the representation space. Furthermore, we analyze the adjustments in feature distributions due to regularization in relation to these contours and directions, from which we uncover central mechanisms inducing improved calibration and robustness. Our findings provide new insights into the characteristics of the high-dimensional representation space in relation to training and regularization using soft labels.

Abstract: Current large multimodal models (LMMs) face challenges in grounding, which requires the model to relate language components to visual entities. Contrary to the common practice that fine-tunes LMMs with additional grounding supervision, we find that the grounding ability can in fact emerge in LMMs trained without explicit grounding supervision. To reveal this emerging grounding, we introduce an "attend-and-segment" method which leverages attention maps from standard LMMs to perform pixel-level segmentation. Furthermore, to enhance the grounding ability, we propose DIFFLMM, an LMM utilizing a diffusion-based visual encoder, as opposed to the standard CLIP visual encoder, and trained with the same weak supervision. Without being constrained by the biases and limited scale of grounding-specific supervision data, our approach is more generalizable and scalable. We achieve competitive performance on both grounding-specific and general visual question answering benchmarks, compared with grounding LMMs and generalist LMMs, respectively. Notably, we achieve a 44.2 grounding mask recall on grounded conversation generation without any grounding supervision, outperforming the extensively supervised model GLaMM.

Abstract: We address the task of advertisement image generation and introduce three evaluation metrics to assess Creativity, prompt Alignment, and Persuasiveness (CAP) in generated advertisement images. Despite recent advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation and their performance in generating high-quality images for explicit descriptions, evaluating these models remains challenging. Existing evaluation methods focus largely on assessing alignment with explicit, detailed descriptions, but evaluating alignment with visually implicit prompts remains an open problem. Additionally, creativity and persuasiveness are essential qualities that enhance the effectiveness of advertisement images, yet are seldom measured. To address this, we propose three novel metrics for evaluating the creativity, alignment, and persuasiveness of generated images. Our findings reveal that current T2I models struggle with creativity, persuasiveness, and alignment when the input text is implicit messages. We further introduce a simple yet effective approach to enhance T2I models' capabilities in producing images that are better aligned, more creative, and more persuasive.

Abstract: We present HuGDiffusion, a generalizable 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) learning pipeline to achieve novel view synthesis (NVS) of human characters from single-view input images. Existing approaches typically require monocular videos or calibrated multi-view images as inputs, whose applicability could be weakened in real-world scenarios with arbitrary and/or unknown camera poses. In this paper, we aim to generate the set of 3DGS attributes via a diffusion-based framework conditioned on human priors extracted from a single image. Specifically, we begin with carefully integrated human-centric feature extraction procedures to deduce informative conditioning signals. Based on our empirical observations that jointly learning the whole 3DGS attributes is challenging to optimize, we design a multi-stage generation strategy to obtain different types of 3DGS attributes. To facilitate the training process, we investigate constructing proxy ground-truth 3D Gaussian attributes as high-quality attribute-level supervision signals. Through extensive experiments, our HuGDiffusion shows significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Volumetric rendering has become central to modern novel view synthesis methods, which use differentiable rendering to optimize 3D scene representations directly from observed views. While many recent works build on NeRF or 3D Gaussians, we explore an alternative volumetric scene representation. More specifically, we introduce two new scene representations based on linear primitives - octahedra and tetrahedra - both of which define homogeneous volumes bounded by triangular faces. To optimize these primitives, we present a differentiable rasterizer that runs efficiently on GPUs, allowing end-to-end gradient-based optimization while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities. Through experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate comparable performance to state-of-the-art volumetric methods while requiring fewer primitives to achieve similar reconstruction fidelity. Our findings deepen the understanding of 3D representations by providing insights into the fidelity and performance characteristics of transparent polyhedra and suggest that adopting novel primitives can expand the available design space.

Abstract: High-quality instance and panoptic segmentation has traditionally relied on dense instance-level annotations such as masks, boxes, or points, which are costly, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. Unsupervised and weakly-supervised approaches reduce this burden but remain constrained by semantic backbone constraints and human bias, often producing merged or fragmented outputs. We present TRACE (TRAnsforming diffusion Cues to instance Edges), showing that text-to-image diffusion models secretly function as instance edge annotators. TRACE identifies the Instance Emergence Point (IEP) where object boundaries first appear in self-attention maps, extracts boundaries through Attention Boundary Divergence (ABDiv), and distills them into a lightweight one-step edge decoder. This design removes the need for per-image diffusion inversion, achieving 81x faster inference while producing sharper and more connected boundaries. On the COCO benchmark, TRACE improves unsupervised instance segmentation by +5.1 AP, and in tag-supervised panoptic segmentation it outperforms point-supervised baselines by +1.7 PQ without using any instance-level labels. These results reveal that diffusion models encode hidden instance boundary priors, and that decoding these signals offers a practical and scalable alternative to costly manual annotation.

Abstract: This paper introduces a holistic vision-language foundation model tailored for remote sensing, named Falcon. Falcon offers a unified, prompt-based paradigm that effectively executes comprehensive and complex remote sensing tasks. Falcon demonstrates powerful understanding and reasoning abilities at the image, region, and pixel levels. Specifically, given simple natural language instructions and remote sensing images, Falcon can produce impressive results in text form across 14 distinct tasks, i.e., image classification, object detection, segmentation, image captioning, and etc. To facilitate Falcon's training and empower its representation capacity to encode rich spatial and semantic information, we developed Falcon_SFT, a large-scale, multi-task, instruction-tuning dataset in the field of remote sensing. The Falcon_SFT dataset consists of approximately 78 million high-quality data samples, covering 5.6 million multi-spatial resolution and multi-view remote sensing images with diverse instructions. It features hierarchical annotations and undergoes manual sampling verification to ensure high data quality and reliability. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted, which verify that Falcon achieves remarkable performance over 67 datasets and 14 tasks, despite having only 0.7B parameters. We release the complete dataset, code, and model weights at https://github.com/TianHuiLab/Falcon, hoping to help further develop the open-source community.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technologies, synthetic images have become increasingly prevalent in everyday life, posing new challenges for authenticity assessment and detection. Despite the effectiveness of existing methods in evaluating image authenticity and locating forgeries, these approaches often lack human interpretability and do not fully address the growing complexity of synthetic data. To tackle these challenges, we introduce FakeVLM, a specialized large multimodal model designed for both general synthetic image and DeepFake detection tasks. FakeVLM not only excels in distinguishing real from fake images but also provides clear, natural language explanations for image artifacts, enhancing interpretability. Additionally, we present FakeClue, a comprehensive dataset containing over 100,000 images across seven categories, annotated with fine-grained artifact clues in natural language. FakeVLM demonstrates performance comparable to expert models while eliminating the need for additional classifiers, making it a robust solution for synthetic data detection. Extensive evaluations across multiple datasets confirm the superiority of FakeVLM in both authenticity classification and artifact explanation tasks, setting a new benchmark for synthetic image detection. The code, model weights, and dataset can be found here: https://github.com/opendatalab/FakeVLM.

Abstract: In Omnimatte, one aims to decompose a given video into semantically meaningful layers, including the background and individual objects along with their associated effects, such as shadows and reflections. Existing methods often require extensive training or costly self-supervised optimization. In this paper, we present OmnimatteZero, a training-free approach that leverages off-the-shelf pre-trained video diffusion models for omnimatte. It can remove objects from videos, extract individual object layers along with their effects, and composite those objects onto new videos. These are accomplished by adapting zero-shot image inpainting techniques for video object removal, a task they fail to handle effectively out-of-the-box. To overcome this, we introduce temporal and spatial attention guidance modules that steer the diffusion process for accurate object removal and temporally consistent background reconstruction. We further show that self-attention maps capture information about the object and its footprints and use them to inpaint the object's effects, leaving a clean background. Additionally, through simple latent arithmetic, object layers can be isolated and recombined seamlessly with new video layers to produce new videos. Evaluations show that OmnimatteZero not only achieves superior performance in terms of background reconstruction but also sets a new record for the fastest Omnimatte approach, achieving real-time performance with minimal frame runtime.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have lead to major improvements in multimodal reasoning, yet they still struggle to understand user-specific concepts. Existing personalization methods address this limitation but heavily rely on training procedures, that can be either costly or unpleasant to individual users. We depart from existing work, and for the first time explore the training-free setting in the context of personalization. We propose a novel method, Retrieval and Reasoning for Personalization (R2P), leveraging internal knowledge of VLMs. First, we leverage VLMs to extract the concept fingerprint, i.e., key attributes uniquely defining the concept within its semantic class. When a query arrives, the most similar fingerprints are retrieved and scored via chain-of-thought-reasoning. To reduce the risk of hallucinations, the scores are validated through cross-modal verification at the attribute level: in case of a discrepancy between the scores, R2P refines the concept association via pairwise multimodal matching, where the retrieved fingerprints and their images are directly compared with the query. We validate R2P on two publicly available benchmarks and a newly introduced dataset, Personal Concepts with Visual Ambiguity (PerVA), for concept identification highlighting challenges in visual ambiguity. R2P consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on various downstream tasks across all benchmarks. Code will be available upon acceptance.

<title>3DOT: Texture Transfer for 3DGS Objects from a Single Reference Image</title>

Abstract: 3D texture swapping allows for the customization of 3D object textures, enabling efficient and versatile visual transformations in 3D editing. While no dedicated method exists, adapted 2D editing and text-driven 3D editing approaches can serve this purpose. However, 2D editing requires frame-by-frame manipulation, causing inconsistencies across views, while text-driven 3D editing struggles to preserve texture characteristics from reference images. To tackle these challenges, we introduce 3DSwapping, a 3D texture swapping method that integrates: 1) progressive generation, 2) view-consistency gradient guidance, and 3) prompt-tuned gradient guidance. To ensure view consistency, our progressive generation process starts by editing a single reference image and gradually propagates the edits to adjacent views. Our view-consistency gradient guidance further reinforces consistency by conditioning the generation model on feature differences between consistent and inconsistent outputs. To preserve texture characteristics, we introduce prompt-tuning-based gradient guidance, which learns a token that precisely captures the difference between the reference image and the 3D object. This token then guides the editing process, ensuring more consistent texture preservation across views. Overall, 3DSwapping integrates these novel strategies to achieve higher-fidelity texture transfer while preserving structural coherence across multiple viewpoints. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations confirm that our three novel components enable convincing and effective 2D texture swapping for 3D objects. Code will be available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Traditional image classification requires a predefined list of semantic categories. In contrast, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) can sidestep this requirement by classifying images directly using natural language (e.g., answering the prompt "What is the main object in the image?"). Despite this remarkable capability, most existing studies on LMM classification performance are surprisingly limited in scope, often assuming a closed-world setting with a predefined set of categories. In this work, we address this gap by thoroughly evaluating LMM classification performance in a truly open-world setting. We first formalize the task and introduce an evaluation protocol, defining various metrics to assess the alignment between predicted and ground truth classes. We then evaluate 13 models across 10 benchmarks, encompassing prototypical, non-prototypical, fine-grained, and very fine-grained classes, demonstrating the challenges LMMs face in this task. Further analyses based on the proposed metrics reveal the types of errors LMMs make, highlighting challenges related to granularity and fine-grained capabilities, showing how tailored prompting and reasoning can alleviate them.

Abstract: Deploying high-performance object detectors on TinyML platforms poses significant challenges due to tight hardware constraints and the modular complexity of modern detection pipelines. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) offers a path toward automation, but existing methods either restrict optimization to individual modules, sacrificing cross-module synergy, or require global searches that are computationally intractable. We propose ELASTIC (Efficient Once for AlL IterAtive Search for ObjecT DetectIon on MiCrocontrollers), a unified, hardware-aware NAS framework that alternates optimization across modules (e.g., backbone, neck, and head) in a cyclic fashion. ELASTIC introduces a novel Population Passthrough mechanism in evolutionary search that retains high-quality candidates between search stages, yielding faster convergence, up to an 8% final mAP gain, and eliminates search instability observed without population passthrough. In a controlled comparison, empirical results show ELASTIC achieves +4.75% higher mAP and 2x faster convergence than progressive NAS strategies on SVHN, and delivers a +9.09% mAP improvement on PascalVOC given the same search budget. ELASTIC achieves 72.3% mAP on PascalVOC, outperforming MCUNET by 20.9% and TinyissimoYOLO by 16.3%. When deployed on MAX78000/MAX78002 microcontrollers, ELASTICderived models outperform Analog Devices' TinySSD baselines, reducing energy by up to 71.6%, lowering latency by up to 2.4x, and improving mAP by up to 6.99 percentage points across multiple datasets.

<title>EDIT: Enhancing Vision Transformers by Mitigating Attention Sink through an Encoder-Decoder Architecture</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose EDIT (Encoder-Decoder Image Transformer), a novel architecture designed to mitigate the attention sink phenomenon observed in Vision Transformer models. Attention sink occurs when an excessive amount of attention is allocated to the [CLS] token, distorting the model's ability to effectively process image patches. To address this, we introduce a layer-aligned encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder utilizes self-attention to process image patches, while the decoder uses cross-attention to focus on the [CLS] token. Unlike traditional encoder-decoder framework, where the decoder depends solely on high-level encoder representations, EDIT allows the decoder to extract information starting from low-level features, progressively refining the representation layer by layer. EDIT is naturally interpretable demonstrated through sequential attention maps, illustrating the refined, layer-by-layer focus on key image features. Experiments on ImageNet-1k and ImageNet-21k, along with transfer learning tasks, show that EDIT achieves consistent performance improvements over DeiT3 models. These results highlight the effectiveness of EDIT's design in addressing attention sink and improving visual feature extraction.

Abstract: Generating video from various conditions, such as text, image, and audio, enables both spatial and temporal control, leading to high-quality generation results. Videos with dramatic motions often require a higher frame rate to ensure smooth motion. Currently, most audio-to-visual animation models use uniformly sampled frames from video clips. However, these uniformly sampled frames fail to capture significant key moments in dramatic motions at low frame rates and require significantly more memory when increasing the number of frames directly. In this paper, we propose KeyVID, a keyframe-aware audio-to-visual animation framework that significantly improves the generation quality for key moments in audio signals while maintaining computation efficiency. Given an image and an audio input, we first localize keyframe time steps from the audio. Then, we use a keyframe generator to generate the corresponding visual keyframes. Finally, we generate all intermediate frames using the motion interpolator. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that KeyVID significantly improves audio-video synchronization and video quality across multiple datasets, particularly for highly dynamic motions. The code is released in https://github.com/XingruiWang/KeyVID.

Abstract: Temporally consistent video-to-video generation is critical for applications such as style transfer and upsampling. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of warped noise - a recently proposed technique for training video diffusion models - and show that pairing it with the standard denoising objective implicitly trains models to be equivariant to spatial transformations of the input noise, which we term EquiVDM. This equivariance enables motion in the input noise to align naturally with motion in the generated video, yielding coherent, high-fidelity outputs without the need for specialized modules or auxiliary losses. A further advantage is sampling efficiency: EquiVDM achieves comparable or superior quality in far fewer sampling steps. When distilled into one-step student models, EquiVDM preserves equivariance and delivers stronger motion controllability and fidelity than distilled nonequivariant baselines. Across benchmarks, EquiVDM consistently outperforms prior methods in motion alignment, temporal consistency, and perceptual quality, while substantially lowering sampling cost.

Abstract: The field of Fake Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) is highly fragmented, encompassing four domains: deepfake detection (Deepfake), image manipulation detection and localization (IMDL), artificial intelligence-generated image detection (AIGC), and document image manipulation localization (Doc). Although individual benchmarks exist in some domains, a unified benchmark for all domains in FIDL remains blank. The absence of a unified benchmark results in significant domain silos, where each domain independently constructs its datasets, models, and evaluation protocols without interoperability, preventing cross-domain comparisons and hindering the development of the entire FIDL field. To close the domain silo barrier, we propose ForensicHub, the first unified benchmark & codebase for all-domain fake image detection and localization. Considering drastic variations on dataset, model, and evaluation configurations across all domains, as well as the scarcity of open-sourced baseline models and the lack of individual benchmarks in some domains, ForensicHub: i) proposes a modular and configuration-driven architecture that decomposes forensic pipelines into interchangeable components across datasets, transforms, models, and evaluators, allowing flexible composition across all domains; ii) fully implements 10 baseline models, 6 backbones, 2 new benchmarks for AIGC and Doc, and integrates 2 existing benchmarks of DeepfakeBench and IMDLBenCo through an adapter-based design; iii) conducts indepth analysis based on the ForensicHub, offering 8 key actionable insights into FIDL model architecture, dataset characteristics, and evaluation standards. ForensicHub represents a significant leap forward in breaking the domain silos in the FIDL field and inspiring future breakthroughs.

Abstract: Remote-sensing applications often run on edge hardware that cannot host today's 7B-parameter multimodal language models. This paper introduces TinyRS, the first 2B-parameter multimodal small language model (MSLM) optimized for remote sensing tasks, and TinyRS-R1, its reasoning-augmented variant. Built upon Qwen2-VL-2B, TinyRS is trained through a four-stage pipeline: pre-training on million satellite images, instruction tuning on visual instruction examples, fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations from the proposed reasoning dataset, and alignment via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). TinyRS-R1 achieves or surpasses the performance of recent 7B-parameter remote sensing models across classification, VQA, visual grounding, and open-ended question answering-while requiring just one-third of the memory and latency. Our analysis shows that CoT reasoning substantially benefits spatial grounding and scene understanding, while the non-reasoning TinyRS excels in concise, latency-sensitive VQA tasks. TinyRS-R1 represents the first domain-specialized MSLM with GRPO-aligned CoT reasoning for general-purpose remote sensing.

Abstract: Despite their remarkable progress in multimodal understanding tasks, large vision language models (LVLMs) often suffer from "hallucinations", generating texts misaligned with the visual context. Existing methods aimed at reducing hallucinations through inference time intervention incur a significant increase in latency. To mitigate this, we present SPIN, a task-agnostic attention-guided head suppression strategy that can be seamlessly integrated during inference, without incurring any significant compute or latency overhead. We investigate whether hallucination in LVLMs can be linked to specific model components. Our analysis suggests that hallucinations can be attributed to a dynamic subset of attention heads in each layer. Leveraging this insight, for each text query token, we selectively suppress attention heads that exhibit low attention to image tokens, keeping the top-K attention heads intact. Extensive evaluations on visual question answering and image description tasks demonstrate the efficacy of SPIN in reducing hallucination scores up to 2.7x while maintaining F1, and improving throughput by 1.8x compared to existing alternatives. Code is available at https://github.com/YUECHE77/SPIN.

Abstract: As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent historical contexts remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark for evaluating how TTI models depict historical contexts. The benchmark combines HistVis, a dataset of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three state-of-the-art diffusion models from carefully designed prompts covering universal human activities across multiple historical periods, with a reproducible evaluation protocol. We evaluate generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras; (2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible demographic patterns. By providing a reproducible benchmark for historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an initial step toward building more historically accurate TTI models.

Abstract: Given the central role of charts in scientific, business, and communication contexts, enhancing the chart understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) has become increasingly critical. A key limitation of existing VLMs lies in their inaccurate visual grounding of infographic elements, including charts and human-recognizable objects (HROs) such as icons and images. However, chart understanding often requires identifying relevant elements and reasoning over them. To address this limitation, we introduce InfoDet, a dataset designed to support the development of accurate object detection models for charts and HROs in infographics. It contains 11,264 real and 90,000 synthetic infographics, with over 14 million bounding box annotations. These annotations are created by combining the model-in-the-loop and programmatic methods. We demonstrate the usefulness of InfoDet through three applications: 1) constructing a Thinking-with-Boxes scheme to boost the chart understanding performance of VLMs, 2) comparing existing object detection models, and 3) applying the developed detection model to document layout and UI element detection.

Abstract: Infographic charts are a powerful medium for communicating abstract data by combining visual elements (e.g., charts, images) with textual information. However, their visual and structural richness poses challenges for large vision-language models (LVLMs), which are typically trained on plain charts. To bridge this gap, we introduce ChartGalaxy, a million-scale dataset designed to advance the understanding and generation of infographic charts. The dataset is constructed through an inductive process that identifies 75 chart types, 440 chart variations, and 68 layout templates from real infographic charts and uses them to create synthetic ones programmatically. We showcase the utility of this dataset through: 1) improving infographic chart understanding via fine-tuning, 2) benchmarking code generation for infographic charts, and 3) enabling example-based infographic chart generation. By capturing the visual and structural complexity of real design, ChartGalaxy provides a useful resource for enhancing multimodal reasoning and generation in LVLMs.

Abstract: Image editing has made great progress on planar images, but panoramic image editing remains underexplored. Due to their spherical geometry and projection distortions, panoramic images present three key challenges: boundary discontinuity, trajectory deformation, and uneven pixel density. To tackle these issues, we propose SphereDrag, a novel panoramic editing framework utilizing spherical geometry knowledge for accurate and controllable editing. Specifically, adaptive reprojection (AR) uses adaptive spherical rotation to deal with discontinuity; great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) tracks the movement trajectory more accurate; spherical search region tracking (SSRT) adaptively scales the search range based on spherical location to address uneven pixel density. Also, we construct PanoBench, a panoramic editing benchmark, including complex editing tasks involving multiple objects and diverse styles, which provides a standardized evaluation framework. Experiments show that SphereDrag gains a considerable improvement compared with existing methods in geometric consistency and image quality, achieving up to 10.5% relative improvement.

Abstract: Effective management of agricultural landscapes is critical for meeting global biodiversity targets, but efforts are hampered by the absence of detailed, large-scale ecological maps. To address this, we introduce Farmscapes, the first large-scale (covering most of England), high-resolution (25cm) map of rural landscape features, including ecologically vital elements like hedgerows, woodlands, and stone walls. This map was generated using a deep learning segmentation model trained on a novel, dataset of 942 manually annotated tiles derived from aerial imagery. Our model accurately identifies key habitats, achieving high f1-scores for woodland (96\%) and farmed land (95\%), and demonstrates strong capability in segmenting linear features, with an F1-score of 72\% for hedgerows. By releasing the England-wide map on Google Earth Engine, we provide a powerful, open-access tool for ecologists and policymakers. This work enables data-driven planning for habitat restoration, supports the monitoring of initiatives like the EU Biodiversity Strategy, and lays the foundation for advanced analysis of landscape connectivity.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a critical task in a wide range of applications but remains challenging due to the subjective nature of human perception and the complexity of real-world image distortions. This study proposes MetaQAP, a novel no-reference IQA model designed to address these challenges by leveraging quality-aware pre-training and meta-learning. The model performs three key contributions: pre-training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on a quality-aware dataset, implementing a quality-aware loss function to optimize predictions, and integrating a meta-learner to form an ensemble model that effectively combines predictions from multiple base models. Experimental evaluations were conducted on three benchmark datasets: LiveCD, KonIQ-10K, and BIQ2021. The proposed MetaQAP model achieved exceptional performance with Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC) scores of 0.9885/0.9812 on LiveCD, 0.9702/0.9658 on KonIQ-10K, and 0.884/0.8765 on BIQ2021, outperforming existing IQA methods. Cross-dataset evaluations further demonstrated the generalizability of the model, with PLCC and SROCC scores ranging from 0.6721 to 0.8023 and 0.6515 to 0.7805, respectively, across diverse datasets. The ablation study confirmed the significance of each model component, revealing substantial performance degradation when critical elements such as the meta-learner or quality-aware loss function were omitted. MetaQAP not only addresses the complexities of authentic distortions but also establishes a robust and generalizable framework for practical IQA applications. By advancing the state-of-the-art in no-reference IQA, this research provides valuable insights and methodologies for future improvements and extensions in the field.

Abstract: In dynamic 3D environments, accurately updating scene representations over time is crucial for applications in robotics, mixed reality, and embodied AI. As scenes evolve, efficient methods to incorporate changes are needed to maintain up-to-date, high-quality reconstructions without the computational overhead of re-optimizing the entire scene. This paper introduces CL-Splats, which incrementally updates Gaussian splatting-based 3D representations from sparse scene captures. CL-Splats integrates a robust change-detection module that segments updated and static components within the scene, enabling focused, local optimization that avoids unnecessary re-computation. Moreover, CL-Splats supports storing and recovering previous scene states, facilitating temporal segmentation and new scene-analysis applications. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CL-Splats achieves efficient updates with improved reconstruction quality over the state-of-the-art. This establishes a robust foundation for future real-time adaptation in 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning constructs a comprehensive road network by capturing the topological relationships between lane segments and their semantic types. This enables end-to-end autonomous driving systems to perform road-dependent maneuvers such as turning and lane changing. However, the limitations in consistent positional embedding and temporal multiple attribute learning in existing methods hinder accurate roadnet reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose TopoStreamer, an end-to-end temporal perception model for lane segment topology reasoning. Specifically, TopoStreamer introduces three key improvements: streaming attribute constraints, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding, and lane segment denoising. The streaming attribute constraints enforce temporal consistency in both centerline and boundary coordinates, along with their classifications. Meanwhile, dynamic lane boundary positional encoding enhances the learning of up-to-date positional information within queries, while lane segment denoising helps capture diverse lane segment patterns, ultimately improving model performance. Additionally, we assess the accuracy of existing models using a lane boundary classification metric, which serves as a crucial measure for lane-changing scenarios in autonomous driving. On the OpenLane-V2 dataset, TopoStreamer demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial performance gains of +3.0% mAP in lane segment perception and +1.7% OLS in centerline perception tasks.

Abstract: Lightweight convolutional and transformer-based networks are increasingly preferred for real-time image classification, especially on resource-constrained devices. This study evaluates the impact of hyperparameter optimization on the accuracy and deployment feasibility of seven modern lightweight architectures: ConvNeXt-T, EfficientNetV2-S, MobileNetV3-L, MobileViT v2 (S/XS), RepVGG-A2, and TinyViT-21M, trained on a class-balanced subset of 90,000 images from ImageNet-1K. Under standardized training settings, this paper investigates the influence of learning rate schedules, augmentation, optimizers, and initialization on model performance. Inference benchmarks are performed using an NVIDIA L40s GPU with batch sizes ranging from 1 to 512, capturing latency and throughput in real-time conditions. This work demonstrates that controlled hyperparameter variation significantly alters convergence dynamics in lightweight CNN and transformer backbones, providing insight into stability regions and deployment feasibility in edge artificial intelligence. Our results reveal that tuning alone leads to a top-1 accuracy improvement of 1.5 to 3.5 percent over baselines, and select models (e.g., RepVGG-A2, MobileNetV3-L) deliver latency under 5 milliseconds and over 9,800 frames per second, making them ideal for edge deployment. This work provides reproducible, subset-based insights into lightweight hyperparameter tuning and its role in balancing speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Lane segment topology reasoning provides comprehensive bird's-eye view (BEV) road scene understanding, which can serve as a key perception module in planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing lane topology reasoning methods often fall short in effectively leveraging temporal information to enhance detection and reasoning performance. Recently, stream-based temporal propagation method has demonstrated promising results by incorporating temporal cues at both the query and BEV levels. However, it remains limited by over-reliance on historical queries, vulnerability to pose estimation failures, and insufficient temporal propagation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FASTopoWM, a novel fast-slow lane segment topology reasoning framework augmented with latent world models. To reduce the impact of pose estimation failures, this unified framework enables parallel supervision of both historical and newly initialized queries, facilitating mutual reinforcement between the fast and slow systems. Furthermore, we introduce latent query and BEV world models conditioned on the action latent to propagate the state representations from past observations to the current timestep. This design substantially improves the performance of temporal perception within the slow pipeline. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2 benchmark demonstrate that FASTopoWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both lane segment detection (37.4% v.s. 33.6% on mAP) and centerline perception (46.3% v.s. 41.5% on OLS).

Abstract: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction, advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective. However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth 3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such audio-centric systems inherently exclude individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT) and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication. Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation. We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii) exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii) achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models across SLT, VSR, ASR, and Audio-Visual Speech Recognition. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a key linguistic insight: explicitly modeling lip movements as a distinct modality significantly improves SLT performance by capturing critical non-manual cues.

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets, high-fidelity, realistic replicas of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC}}, and TUMTraf-I. Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling, the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition, the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ucf-ut.

Abstract: Talking-head animation focuses on generating realistic facial videos from audio input. Following Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models have become the mainstream, owing to their robust generative capacities. However, inherent limitations of the diffusion process often lead to inter-frame flicker and slow inference, restricting their practical deployment. To address this, we introduce AvatarSync, an autoregressive framework on phoneme representations that generates realistic and controllable talking-head animations from a single reference image, driven directly by text or audio input. To mitigate flicker and ensure continuity, AvatarSync leverages an autoregressive pipeline that enhances temporal modeling. In addition, to ensure controllability, we introduce phonemes, which are the basic units of speech sounds, and construct a many-to-one mapping from text/audio to phonemes, enabling precise phoneme-to-visual alignment. Additionally, to further accelerate inference, we adopt a two-stage generation strategy that decouples semantic modeling from visual dynamics, and incorporate a customized Phoneme-Frame Causal Attention Mask to support multi-step parallel acceleration. Extensive experiments conducted on both Chinese (CMLR) and English (HDTF) datasets demonstrate that AvatarSync outperforms existing talking-head animation methods in visual fidelity, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency, providing a scalable and controllable solution.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has advanced rapidly, yet reliable and interpretable evaluation remains a bottleneck. Current protocols either (i) depend on paired reference images-resulting in limited coverage and inheriting biases from prior generative models-or (ii) rely solely on zero-shot vision-language models (VLMs), whose prompt-based assessments of instruction following, content consistency, and visual quality are often imprecise. To address this, we introduce EdiVal-Agent, an automated and fine-grained evaluation framework grounded in an object-centric perspective, designed to assess not only standard single-turn but also multi-turn instruction-based editing with precision. Given an input image, EdiVal-Agent first decomposes it into semantically meaningful objects, then synthesizes diverse, context-aware editing instructions while dynamically updating object pools across turns. These two stages enable two novel object-centric metrics tailored for multi-turn evaluation and one global metric of visual quality: (1) EdiVal-IF, which measures instruction following by combining open-vocabulary object detectors for symbolic checks with VLMs for semantic verification on detector-guided crops; (2) EdiVal-CC, which evaluates content consistency by calculating semantic similarity of unchanged objects and background using the evolving object pools; and (3) EdiVal-VQ, which quantifies changes in overall visual quality with human preference models. Instantiating this pipeline, we build EdiVal-Bench, a multi-turn editing benchmark covering 9 instruction types and 13 state-of-the-art editing models spanning in-context, flow-matching, and diffusion paradigms. We demonstrate that EdiVal-Agent can be used to identify existing failure modes, thereby informing the development of the next generation of editing models.

Abstract: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts-even in 3D-text contrastive learning. We introduce SceneForge, a novel framework that enhances contrastive alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured multi-object scene compositions. SceneForge leverages individual 3D shapes to construct multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairing them with coherent multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model. By augmenting contrastive training with these structured, compositional samples, SceneForge effectively addresses the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets, significantly enriching data complexity and diversity. We systematically investigate critical design elements, such as the optimal number of objects per scene, the proportion of compositional samples in training batches, and scene construction strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneForge delivers substantial performance gains across multiple tasks, including zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet, as well as few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart. SceneForge's compositional augmentations are model-agnostic, consistently improving performance across multiple encoder architectures. Moreover, SceneForge improves 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, generalizes robustly to retrieval scenarios with increasing scene complexity, and showcases spatial reasoning capabilities by adapting spatial configurations to align precisely with textual instructions.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require high-resolution visual information to perform fine-grained perception, yet processing entire high-resolution images is computationally prohibitive. While recent methods leverage a Region-of-Interest (RoI) mechanism to focus on salient areas, they typically present a difficult trade-off: training-based approaches depend on large-scale annotated datasets, while training-free methods that utilize the model's internal attention are computationally inefficient and less accurate, requiring either multi-pass prefill stages or reliance on the slow auto-regressive decoding process. In this paper, we propose an efficient, annotation-free Self-Distilled Region Proposal Network (SD-RPN) that resolves this trade-off. The SD-RPN is built around a pipeline that transforms the noisy attention maps from the MLLM's middle layers into high-quality pseudo-RoI labels by explicitly denoising the signal and resolving ambiguity. We use these labels to train a lightweight Region Proposal Network (RPN) that learns a more precise localization. This RPN is also highly efficient, predicting the RoI in a single forward pass using features from the MLLM's middle layers, decoupling RoI identification from the auto-regressive generation and avoiding costly multi-pass operations. To validate our approach, we integrate the framework into multiple MLLM families. Despite being trained on only a few (e.g. 10K) question-answer pairs, our method demonstrates exceptional data efficiency and generalization, achieving over a 10% absolute accuracy improvement on unseen benchmarks, including TextVQA, DocVQA, and V-Star. Our work presents a practical and scalable solution for enhancing the fine-grained perception of MLLMs without requiring costly supervision or full model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Multi-image Interleaved Reasoning aims to improve Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) ability to jointly comprehend and reason across multiple images and their associated textual contexts, introducing unique challenges beyond single-image or non-interleaved multi-image tasks. While current multi-image benchmarks overlook interleaved textual contexts and neglect distinct relationships between individual images and their associated texts, enabling models to reason over multi-image interleaved data may significantly enhance their comprehension of complex scenes and better capture cross-modal correlations. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark MIR, requiring joint reasoning over multiple images accompanied by interleaved textual contexts to accurately associate image regions with corresponding texts and logically connect information across images. To enhance MLLMs ability to comprehend multi-image interleaved data, we introduce reasoning steps for each instance within the benchmark and propose a stage-wise curriculum learning strategy. This strategy follows an "easy to hard" approach, progressively guiding models from simple to complex scenarios, thereby enhancing their ability to handle challenging tasks. Extensive experiments benchmarking multiple MLLMs demonstrate that our method significantly enhances models reasoning performance on MIR and other established benchmarks. We believe that MIR will encourage further research into multi-image interleaved reasoning, facilitating advancements in MLLMs capability to handle complex inter-modal tasks.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity images of humans with fine-grained control over attributes such as hairstyle and clothing remains a core challenge in personalized text-to-image synthesis. While prior methods emphasize identity preservation from a reference image, they lack modularity and fail to provide disentangled control over specific visual attributes. We introduce a new paradigm for attribute-specific image prompting, in which distinct sets of reference images are used to guide the generation of individual aspects of human appearance, such as hair, clothing, and identity. Our method encodes these inputs into attribute-specific tokens, which are injected into a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. This enables compositional and disentangled control over multiple visual factors, even across multiple people within a single image. To promote natural composition and robust disentanglement, we curate a cross-reference training dataset featuring subjects in diverse poses and expressions, and propose a multi-attribute cross-reference training strategy that encourages the model to generate faithful outputs from misaligned attribute inputs while adhering to both identity and textual conditioning. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in accurately following both visual and textual prompts. Our framework paves the way for more configurable human image synthesis by combining visual prompting with text-driven generation. Webpage is available at: https://snap-research.github.io/composeme/.

Abstract: The rise of realistic digital face generation and manipulation poses significant social risks. The primary challenge lies in the rapid and diverse evolution of generation techniques, which often outstrip the detection capabilities of existing models. To defend against the ever-evolving new types of forgery, we need to enable our model to quickly adapt to new domains with limited computation and data while avoiding forgetting previously learned forgery types. In this work, we posit that genuine facial samples are abundant and relatively stable in acquisition methods, while forgery faces continuously evolve with the iteration of manipulation techniques. Given the practical infeasibility of exhaustively collecting all forgery variants, we frame face forgery detection as a continual learning problem and allow the model to develop as new forgery types emerge. Specifically, we employ a Developmental Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture that uses LoRA models as its individual experts. These experts are organized into two groups: a Real-LoRA to learn and refine knowledge of real faces, and multiple Fake-LoRAs to capture incremental information from different forgery types. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we ensure that the learning direction of Fake-LoRAs is orthogonal to the established subspace. Moreover, we integrate orthogonal gradients into the orthogonal loss of Fake-LoRAs, preventing gradient interference throughout the training process of each task. Experimental results under both the datasets and manipulation types incremental protocols demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: Aligning 3D scene graphs is a crucial initial step for several applications in robot navigation and embodied perception. Current methods in 3D scene graph alignment often rely on single-modality point cloud data and struggle with incomplete or noisy input. We introduce SGAligner++, a cross-modal, language-aided framework for 3D scene graph alignment. Our method addresses the challenge of aligning partially overlapping scene observations across heterogeneous modalities by learning a unified joint embedding space, enabling accurate alignment even under low-overlap conditions and sensor noise. By employing lightweight unimodal encoders and attention-based fusion, SGAligner++ enhances scene understanding for tasks such as visual localization, 3D reconstruction, and navigation, while ensuring scalability and minimal computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that SGAligner++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 40% on noisy real-world reconstructions, while enabling cross-modal generalization.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g., DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward). Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent. Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth observation.

<title>WorldSplat: Gaussian-Centric Feed-Forward 4D Scene Generation for Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos; however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS). Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities. To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we propose WorldSplat, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent multi-track videos through two key steps: (i) We introduce a 4D-aware latent diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. (ii) Subsequently, we refine the novel view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WorldSplat effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

Abstract: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly retraining. We introduce Attention Surgery, an efficient framework for linearizing or hybridizing attention in pretrained VDMs without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models, our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers. Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models, reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0 benchmarks.

<title>ART-VITON: Measurement-Guided Latent Diffusion for Artifact-Free Virtual Try-On</title>

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis, preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions. However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation, leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0 demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background, eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them, always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band, while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row. Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile, serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion models.

Abstract: The Principle of Maximum Entropy is a rigorous technique for estimating an unknown distribution given partial information while simultaneously minimizing bias. However, an important requirement for applying the principle is that the available information be provided error-free (Jaynes 1982). We relax this requirement using a memoryless communication channel as a framework to derive a new, more general principle. We show our new principle provides an upper bound on the entropy of the unknown distribution and the amount of information lost due to the use of a given communications channel is unknown unless the unknown distribution's entropy is also known. Using our new principle we provide a new interpretation of the classic principle and experimentally show its performance relative to the classic principle and other generally applicable solutions. Finally, we present a simple algorithm for solving our new principle and an approximation useful when samples are limited.

Abstract: Subcortical segmentation remains challenging despite its important applications in quantitative structural analysis of brain MRI scans. The most accurate method, manual segmentation, is highly labor intensive, so automated tools like FreeSurfer have been adopted to handle this task. However, these traditional pipelines are slow and inefficient for processing large datasets. In this study, we propose TABSurfer, a novel 3D patch-based CNN-Transformer hybrid deep learning model designed for superior subcortical segmentation compared to existing state-of-the-art tools. To evaluate, we first demonstrate TABSurfer's consistent performance across various T1w MRI datasets with significantly shorter processing times compared to FreeSurfer. Then, we validate against manual segmentations, where TABSurfer outperforms FreeSurfer based on the manual ground truth. In each test, we also establish TABSurfer's advantage over a leading deep learning benchmark, FastSurferVINN. Together, these studies highlight TABSurfer's utility as a powerful tool for fully automated subcortical segmentation with high fidelity.

<title>Pruning Sparse Tensor Neural Networks Enables Deep Learning for 3D Ultrasound Localization Microscopy</title>

Abstract: Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) is a non-invasive technique that allows for the imaging of micro-vessels in vivo, at depth and with a resolution on the order of ten microns. ULM is based on the sub-resolution localization of individual microbubbles injected in the bloodstream. Mapping the whole angioarchitecture requires the accumulation of microbubbles trajectories from thousands of frames, typically acquired over a few minutes. ULM acquisition times can be reduced by increasing the microbubble concentration, but requires more advanced algorithms to detect them individually. Several deep learning approaches have been proposed for this task, but they remain limited to 2D imaging, in part due to the associated large memory requirements. Herein, we propose to use sparse tensor neural networks to reduce memory usage in 2D and to improve the scaling of the memory requirement for the extension of deep learning architecture to 3D. We study several approaches to efficiently convert ultrasound data into a sparse format and study the impact of the associated loss of information. When applied in 2D, the sparse formulation reduces the memory requirements by a factor 2 at the cost of a small reduction of performance when compared against dense networks. In 3D, the proposed approach reduces memory requirements by two order of magnitude while largely outperforming conventional ULM in high concentration settings. We show that Sparse Tensor Neural Networks in 3D ULM allow for the same benefits as dense deep learning based method in 2D ULM i.e. the use of higher concentration in silico and reduced acquisition time.

Abstract: X-ray photon-counting computed tomography (PCCT) for extremity allows multi-energy high-resolution (HR) imaging but its radiation dose can be further improved. Despite the great potential of deep learning techniques, their application in HR volumetric PCCT reconstruction has been challenged by the large memory burden, training data scarcity, and domain gap issues. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based approach for PCCT image reconstruction at halved dose and doubled speed validated in a New Zealand clinical trial. Specifically, we design a patch-based volumetric refinement network to alleviate the GPU memory limitation, train network with synthetic data, and use model-based iterative refinement to bridge the gap between synthetic and clinical data. Our results in a reader study of 8 patients from the clinical trial demonstrate a great potential to cut the radiation dose to half that of the clinical PCCT standard without compromising image quality and diagnostic value.

Abstract: We present VoxelPrompt, an end-to-end image analysis agent that tackles free-form radiological tasks. Given any number of volumetric medical images and a natural language prompt, VoxelPrompt integrates a language model that generates executable code to invoke a jointly-trained, adaptable vision network. This code further carries out analytical steps to address practical quantitative aims, such as measuring the growth of a tumor across visits. The pipelines generated by VoxelPrompt automate analyses that currently require practitioners to painstakingly combine multiple specialized vision and statistical tools. We evaluate VoxelPrompt using diverse neuroimaging tasks and show that it can delineate hundreds of anatomical and pathological features, measure complex morphological properties, and perform open-language analysis of lesion characteristics. VoxelPrompt performs these objectives with an accuracy similar to that of specialist single-task models for image analysis, while facilitating a broad range of compositional biomedical workflows.

Abstract: Recent developments in Large Language Models pre-trained on extensive corpora have shown significant success in various natural language processing tasks with minimal fine-tuning. This success offers new promise for robotics, which has long been constrained by the high cost of action-labeled data. We ask: given the abundant video data containing interaction-related knowledge available as a rich "corpus", can a similar generative pre-training approach be effectively applied to enhance robot learning? The key challenge is to identify an effective representation for autoregressive pre-training that benefits robot manipulation tasks. Inspired by the way humans learn new skills through observing dynamic environments, we propose that effective robotic learning should emphasize motion-related knowledge, which is closely tied to low-level actions and is hardware-agnostic, facilitating the transfer of learned motions to actual robot actions. To this end, we introduce Moto, which converts video content into latent Motion Token sequences by a Latent Motion Tokenizer, learning a bridging "language" of motion from videos in an unsupervised manner. We pre-train Moto-GPT through motion token autoregression, enabling it to capture diverse visual motion knowledge. After pre-training, Moto-GPT demonstrates the promising ability to produce semantically interpretable motion tokens, predict plausible motion trajectories, and assess trajectory rationality through output likelihood. To transfer learned motion priors to real robot actions, we implement a co-fine-tuning strategy that seamlessly bridges latent motion token prediction and real robot control. Extensive experiments show that the fine-tuned Moto-GPT exhibits superior robustness and efficiency on robot manipulation benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in transferring knowledge from video data to downstream visual manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Model merging enables the combination of multiple specialized expert models into a single model capable of performing multiple tasks. However, the benefits of merging an increasing amount of specialized experts generally lead to diminishing returns and reduced overall performance gains. In this work, we offer an explanation and analysis from a task arithmetic perspective; revealing that as the merging process (across numerous existing merging methods) continues for more and more experts, the associated task vector space experiences rank collapse. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Subspace Boosting, which operates on the singular value decomposed task vector space and maintains task vector ranks. Subspace Boosting raises merging efficacy for up to 20 expert models by large margins of more than 10% when evaluated on both vision and language benchmarks. Moreover, we propose employing Higher-Order Generalized Singular Value Decomposition to quantify task similarity, offering a new interpretable perspective on model merging.

Abstract: Objective Renal cancer is a common malignancy and a major cause of cancer-related deaths. Computed tomography (CT) is central to early detection, staging, and treatment planning. However, the growing CT workload increases radiologists' burden and risks incomplete documentation. Automatically generating accurate reports remains challenging because it requires integrating visual interpretation with clinical reasoning. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI), especially large language and vision-language models, offer potential to reduce workload and enhance diagnostic quality.
  Methods We propose a clinically informed, two-stage framework for automatic renal CT report generation. In Stage 1, a multi-task learning model detects structured clinical features from each 2D image. In Stage 2, a vision-language model generates free-text reports conditioned on the image and the detected features. To evaluate clinical fidelity, generated clinical features are extracted from the reports and compared with expert-annotated ground truth.
  Results Experiments on an expert-labeled dataset show that incorporating detected features improves both report quality and clinical accuracy. The model achieved an average AUC of 0.75 for key imaging features and a METEOR score of 0.33, demonstrating higher clinical consistency and fewer template-driven errors.
  Conclusion Linking structured feature detection with conditioned report generation provides a clinically grounded approach to integrate structured prediction and narrative drafting for renal CT reporting. This method enhances interpretability and clinical faithfulness, underscoring the value of domain-relevant evaluation metrics for medical AI development.

Abstract: Edge computing scenarios necessitate the development of hardware-efficient online continual learning algorithms to be adaptive to dynamic environment. However, existing algorithms always suffer from high memory overhead and bias towards recently trained tasks. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a novel online continual learning approach termed as SESLR, which incorporates a sleep enhanced latent replay scheme with spiking neural networks (SNNs). SESLR leverages SNNs' binary spike characteristics to store replay features in single bits, significantly reducing memory overhead. Furthermore, inspired by biological sleep-wake cycles, SESLR introduces a noise-enhanced sleep phase where the model exclusively trains on replay samples with controlled noise injection, effectively mitigating classification bias towards new classes. Extensive experiments on both conventional (MNIST, CIFAR10) and neuromorphic (NMNIST, CIFAR10-DVS) datasets demonstrate SESLR's effectiveness. On Split CIFAR10, SESLR achieves nearly 30% improvement in average accuracy with only one-third of the memory consumption compared to baseline methods. On Split CIFAR10-DVS, it improves accuracy by approximately 10% while reducing memory overhead by a factor of 32. These results validate SESLR as a promising solution for online continual learning in resource-constrained edge computing scenarios.

Abstract: Diffusion and flow-based generative models have achieved remarkable success in domains such as image synthesis, video generation, and natural language modeling. In this work, we extend these advances to weight space learning by leveraging recent techniques to incorporate structural priors derived from optimization dynamics. Central to our approach is modeling the trajectory induced by gradient descent as a trajectory inference problem. We unify several trajectory inference techniques towards matching a gradient flow, providing a theoretical framework for treating optimization paths as inductive bias. We further explore architectural and algorithmic choices, including reward fine-tuning by adjoint matching, the use of autoencoders for latent weight representation, conditioning on task-specific context data, and adopting informative source distributions such as Kaiming uniform. Experiments demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses baselines in generating in-distribution weights, improves initialization for downstream training, and supports fine-tuning to enhance performance. Finally, we illustrate a practical application in safety-critical systems: detecting harmful covariate shifts, where our method outperforms the closest comparable baseline.

Abstract: Accurate liver and tumor segmentation on abdominal CT images is critical for reliable diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to complex anatomical structures, variability in tumor appearance, and limited annotated data. To address these issues, we introduce Hyperbolic-convolutions Adaptive-temporal-attention with Neural-representation and Synaptic-plasticity Network (HANS-Net), a novel segmentation framework that synergistically combines hyperbolic convolutions for hierarchical geometric representation, a wavelet-inspired decomposition module for multi-scale texture learning, a biologically motivated synaptic plasticity mechanism for adaptive feature enhancement, and an implicit neural representation branch to model fine-grained and continuous anatomical boundaries. Additionally, we incorporate uncertainty-aware Monte Carlo dropout to quantify prediction confidence and lightweight temporal attention to improve inter-slice consistency without sacrificing efficiency. Extensive evaluations of the LiTS dataset demonstrate that HANS-Net achieves a mean Dice score of 93.26%, an IoU of 88.09%, an average symmetric surface distance (ASSD) of 0.72 mm, and a volume overlap error (VOE) of 11.91%. Furthermore, cross-dataset validation on the AMOS 2022 dataset obtains an average Dice of 85.09%, IoU of 76.66%, ASSD of 19.49 mm, and VOE of 23.34%, indicating strong generalization across different datasets. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of HANS-Net in providing anatomically consistent, accurate, and confident liver and tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Humans develop an understanding of intuitive physics through active interaction with the world. This approach is in stark contrast to current video models, such as Sora, which rely on passive observation and therefore struggle with grasping physical causality. This observation leads to our central hypothesis: authentic physical intuition of the world model must be grounded in extensive, causally rich interactions with the real world. To test this hypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world model trained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal that the model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution of plausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physical hallucinations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emergent capability can be actively constrained toward physical realism by SOPHIA, where vision-language model agents evaluate the DiT-generated output and guide its refinement by iteratively evolving the language instructions. In addition, a co-trained Inverse Dynamics Model translates these refined plans into executable robotic actions, thus closing the imagination-to-action loop. We establish WoWBench, a new benchmark focused on physical consistency and causal reasoning in video, where WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance in both human and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physical causality, collision dynamics, and object permanence. Our work provides systematic evidence that large-scale, real-world interaction is a cornerstone for developing physical intuition in AI. Models, data, and benchmarks will be open-sourced.

<title>RADAR: A Risk-Aware Dynamic Multi-Agent Framework for LLM Safety Evaluation via Role-Specialized Collaboration</title>

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising 800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability, and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87% improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline evaluation method.

Summary:
Vision language models (VLMs) are enhanced with a vision-centric agent tuning framework that synthesizes multimodal trajectories, preference pairs, and trains for robust tool-use reasoning. The framework leverages the M-TRACE dataset, consisting of 28.5K multimodal tasks and 177K verified trajectories, for trajectory tuning. The MATRIX Agent, refined on M-TRACE, enables step-wise tool reasoning. To enhance alignment, Pref-X, generated preference pairs, are used for optimizing MATRIX through step-wise preference learning. Across benchmarks like Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA, MATRIX outperforms existing VLMs in multimodal tool use. The approach demonstrates scalability and effectiveness in complex reasoning tasks. Data and code are available at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/MATRIX.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of 11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA, MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/MATRIX.

Summary:<br />
SimULi is a new method designed for rigorous testing of autonomous robots by creating high-fidelity simulators. It extends existing methods like 3DGUT to support complex camera models and LiDAR data in real-time using automated tiling and ray-based culling. It addresses cross-sensor inconsistencies through a factorized 3D Gaussian representation, resulting in reduced camera and depth errors compared to previous methods. SimULi is significantly faster than ray tracing and prior rasterization-based methods, rendering in real-time and supporting a wide range of camera models. Evaluation on autonomous driving datasets shows that SimULi achieves high fidelity, matching or exceeding the performance of existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of camera and LiDAR metrics. <div>

Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data. Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40% compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

<div> future prediction, surgical video analysis, real-time AI, surgical safety, operating room efficiency <br />
<br />
Summary: Surgical future prediction is crucial for operating room safety and efficiency. Current AI research focuses on understanding present events rather than predicting future ones. This approach lacks a unified method for both short-term and long-term predictions in surgery. The existing methods are limited by coarse supervision and struggle to generalize across different procedures. To address these limitations, the article proposes a state-change learning approach called SurgFUTR, which classifies state transitions in surgical videos. The method utilizes a teacher-student architecture, Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering, and an Action Dynamics module. SFPBench is introduced to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on five prediction tasks across different datasets and procedures, showing consistent improvements and generalizability through cross-procedure transfer. <div>

Abstract: Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation, lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events) and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations, our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps. We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons. Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

Summary:
- Various deep learning systems have been proposed for accurate plant disease diagnosis.
- These systems often struggle to maintain accuracy on images in different conditions from training data.
- Limited diversity of training data relative to task complexity is a root cause of performance drop.
- The proposed TMPS framework leverages target domain samples to improve diagnostic robustness.
- TMPS outperforms models trained using combined source and target data, achieving significant improvements in F1 score. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However, recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains. To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS), grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21 diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just 10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional metric learning.

<br />
Unified Vision-Language Alignment for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer) is introduced to enhance image captioning models without requiring text labels or full retraining. ViZer aligns vision and language representation features during training, improving captions generated by existing VLMs. Compared to traditional caption metrics, ViZer-produced captions are more detailed and descriptive, enhancing the overall quality of output. When applied to SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL models, ViZer consistently improves caption quality, making them more grounded and informative. This approach addresses the limitations of labeled image datasets and enables the utilization of unlabeled image data for enhanced performance in vision-language tasks.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer actively aligns vision and language representation features during training, enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements, producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

The FetalSigma-1M dataset, containing 20K reports from twelve medical centers, was created for training purposes.

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable.

arXiv:2510.12954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module, ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer, QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g., velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

Summary:
SCOPE introduces a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework for vision-language models (VLMs) that dynamically selects specialized encoders for each image-text pair using instance-level routing. This approach outperforms models using all extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by 24-49%. The framework maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders, with a lightweight router selecting the optimal encoder based on cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features. To train the router, dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses is used to balance dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence. This intelligent encoder selection approach challenges the prevailing brute-force aggregation paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs. <div>
arXiv:2510.12974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence. Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by 24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

The SVAGFormer baseline framework is proposed to address this task by adapting existing vision language models.

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking. Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG, particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces SeqBench, a new benchmark for evaluating narrative coherence in Text-to-video (T2V) generation models. The benchmark includes a dataset of 320 prompts and 2,560 human-annotated videos generated by 8 T2V models. An automatic evaluation metric, based on Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG), is designed to capture long-range dependencies and temporal ordering efficiently. The DTG-based metric shows a strong correlation with human annotations. Evaluation using SeqBench reveals key limitations in current T2V models, such as inconsistencies in object states in multi-action sequences, unrealistic results in multi-object scenarios, and challenges in maintaining realistic timing and ordering relationships between sequential actions. SeqBench provides a systematic framework for assessing narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers insights to enhance sequential reasoning capabilities in future models.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with 2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models. Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models.

<div> SceneAdapt; motion generation; scene awareness; text-to-motion models; keyframing layers <br />
<br />
Summary: 
SceneAdapt is introduced as a framework for incorporating scene awareness into text-conditioned motion models. It addresses the challenge of combining rich text-motion semantics with precise scene interactions. The framework leverages disjoint datasets for scene-motion and text-motion through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. By using motion inbetweening as a proxy task to bridge the datasets, scene awareness is effectively infused into text-to-motion models. Keyframing layers are introduced in the first stage to modulate motion latents for inbetweening while maintaining the latent manifold. In the second stage, a scene-conditioning layer is added to inject scene geometry through adaptive querying of local context using cross-attention. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SceneAdapt in enhancing text-to-motion models with scene awareness. The mechanisms underlying this enhancement are further analyzed, with code and models set to be released. <div>

Abstract: Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold. In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention. Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

Abstract: Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support. Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed. Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative. In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted, and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved. Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

<div> transferability, novel view synthesis, self-supervised, XFactor, pose estimation

Summary:
XFactor is a novel self-supervised model for novel view synthesis (NVS) that prioritizes transferability, allowing for the reconstruction of the same camera trajectory in different 3D scenes using extracted pose representations. Unlike previous models, XFactor effectively disentangles camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric reasoning through pair-wise pose estimation and input-output augmentation. It achieves transferability without 3D inductive biases or explicit parameterization of poses, outperforming existing pose-free NVS transformers. The model introduces a new metric to quantify transferability and demonstrates high correlation between latent poses and real-world poses through probing experiments. XFactor's success lies in its ability to enable true NVS by leveraging unconstrained latent pose variables and prioritizing transferability among different scenes. <div>
arXiv:2510.13063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability: Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes. Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing experiments.

<div> Keywords: image fusion, gradient loss, directional information, edge fidelity, texture preservation<br />
Summary:<br />
This article introduces a new approach for infrared and visible image fusion that focuses on preserving directional information during the training process. Most existing methods collapse gradients to their magnitude, which results in the loss of directional guidance and suboptimal edge fidelity. The proposed direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss separates the horizontal and vertical components and preserves their sign across scales. This axis-wise, sign-preserving objective enhances edge sharpness, alignment, and texture preservation without requiring changes to model architectures or training protocols. Experimental results on open-source models and various public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in producing informative and visually appealing fused images. <div>
arXiv:2510.13067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However, collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information, yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

<div> Domain Shift, Medical Image Segmentation, Deep Learning, Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, Hippocampus

Summary:
This paper introduces an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for medical image segmentation that addresses domain shifts in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI. The approach combines z-normalisation for style harmonisation with bidirectional deformable image registration (DIR) to account for content variations. The DIR network is trained jointly with segmentation and discriminator networks to guide registration based on a region of interest, generating anatomically plausible transformations aligning source images to the target domain. Evaluations on synthetic and MRI hippocampus datasets show superior performance compared to existing methods. When transferring from healthy to dementia populations, the framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in Dice score, particularly in scenarios with significant content shift. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across diverse populations. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across diverse populations.

Summary: 
- Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have made significant advances in generative tasks like image and video synthesis.
- Hallucinations in DPMs can lead to implausible samples conflicting with real-world knowledge.
- Counting hallucination, generating an incorrect number of instances or structured objects, is a specific challenge addressed in this work.
- The CountHalluSet dataset suite and a standardized evaluation protocol are developed to quantify counting hallucinations.
- The study explores how sampling conditions in DPMs impact counting hallucination levels and their correlation with evaluation metrics like FID, highlighting the limitations of existing image quality metrics in capturing counting hallucinations consistently. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets, we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight text-driven zero-shot video editing method that addresses the limitations of existing approaches. It utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM) to efficiently cache and retain important image tokens from previous frames, reducing computational overhead. The Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method ensures temporal consistency by propagating relevant tokens through frames. An SFM update algorithm continuously refreshes cached features for long-term effectiveness. Cross-attention maps are employed to automatically extract masks for target objects, integrating them into the diffusion denoising process for precise editing while maintaining background integrity. Edit-Your-Interest surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and visual fidelity, demonstrating its superior effectiveness in video editing. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM), which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones, preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process, enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

Summary:  
The article introduces the EgoSocial dataset, which aims to improve AI understanding of human social dynamics in AR/VR interactions. Current large language models (LLMs) often struggle to intervene appropriately in social situations, leading to disruptions. The EgoSocial dataset includes 13,500 social video-question pairs for benchmarking intervention in social interaction perception. An analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) reveals their limitations in detecting intervention timing. To address this, the EgoSoD method is proposed, which integrates multimodal contextual cues into a social thinking graph to proactively detect intervention timing and social interactions. Experiments show significant improvements in intervention timing and overall social interaction performance using EgoSoD. The dataset and code will be released soon. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective. However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini 2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions, precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4 by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance. We will release the dataset and code soon.

Abstract: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context. Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

<div> Keywords: VPreg, diffeomorphic image registration, mesh generation, neuroimaging, computational anatomy

Summary:
VPreg is a novel diffeomorphic image registration method that improves upon past work on mesh generation and registration accuracy. It ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and provides an accurate approximation of the inverse registration, essential for neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods, VPreg operates within the group of diffeomorphisms to generate inverse transformations. The core of VPreg is the Variational Principle grid generation approach that constructs non-folding grids with prescribed properties. Performance analysis on brain scans from the OASIS-1 dataset shows VPreg outperforms state-of-the-art methods in Dice scores, regularity of transformation, and accuracy of the inverse map. Comparisons with ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt demonstrate the superiority of VPreg in registration accuracy and consistency.VPreg greatly improves the quality of diffeomorphic image registration for neuroimaging applications, promising better results and more reliable transformations for computational anatomy and morphometry.

Abstract: This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method. This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods, VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl. These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for 35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.

Summary:<br />
This study addresses the challenge of text-image alignment in multimedia content understanding by leveraging the open semantic knowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs). The proposed approach aims to reduce the information entropy gap between texts and images, improving the modeling of cross-modal semantic correspondences. It involves a two-step process: designing a new prompt template to enhance the polysemy description of text using LLM, and utilizing a hypergraph adapter to establish multilateral connections between text and image modalities. The Open Semantic Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter) significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 16.8% and 40.1% gains in text-to-image and image-to-text cross-modal retrieval, respectively. The approach sets a new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks on benchmarks like Flickr30K and MS-COCO. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\% (image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.

Summary: 
This study compares the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition.

<div> Deep learning, geophysical applications, noise reduction, dictionary learning, test-time adaptation 

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach called Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA) for enhancing the denoising performance of Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) signals. The method leverages the intrinsic physical characteristics of TEM signals, such as exponential decay and smoothness, to guide a customized network named DTEMDNet for dynamic parameter adjustment during testing. By integrating dictionary-driven priors and self-supervised losses derived from consistency and signal variation, the proposed method significantly outperforms existing TEM denoising and test-time adaptation approaches. The study underscores the importance of considering regional noise variations in geophysical applications and highlights the effectiveness of incorporating prior knowledge for improving denoising performance in diverse environments. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However, time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance, these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness, which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet. Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA methods.

<div> edge Gaussian splatting, scene reconstruction, heterogeneous view contributions, sample-then-transmit EGS, communication resource constraints <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a novel approach, Sample-then-Transmit Edge Gaussian Splatting (STT-GS), for scene reconstruction that prioritizes global Gaussian Splatting (GS) qualities over communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance. Using feature-domain clustering and pilot transmission time minimization, the STT-GS strategy efficiently samples pilot data from distributed clients. A joint client selection and power control framework maximizes the GS-oriented objective function under communication resource constraints. Despite the nonconvexity of the problem, an efficient solution based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization algorithm is proposed. Experimental results show significant improvements over existing benchmarks, with accurate prediction of the GS-oriented objective at low sampling ratios and a favorable tradeoff between view contributions and communication costs. <div>

Abstract: Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short) strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization (PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm. Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication costs.

Abstract: Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in 2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing training costs, CIGOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI benchmark. The code is provided in the supplementary material and will be released https://github.com/VitaLemonTea1/CIGOcc

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches, inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust, transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

<div> Keywords: stylized motion generation, 3D human motion, speech signals, regional motion styles, emotion cues

Summary:
MimicParts introduces a novel approach to generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals. The framework addresses challenges in capturing diverse motion styles and regional differences in body movements. By dividing the body into different regions, MimicParts enables localized style encoding and fine-grained motion representation. The part-aware attention block allows for precise guidance of rhythm and emotion cues, ensuring adaptive motion generation. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in generating natural and expressive 3D human motion sequences compared to existing methods. MimicParts enhances realism and adaptability in stylized motion generation by incorporating part-aware style injection and a denoising network. The framework not only captures intricate relationships between speech signals and body movements but also dynamically adapts to changes in speech rhythm and emotional state. MimicParts sets a new standard for generating stylized and realistic 3D human motion sequences with nuanced style variations. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements. Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state. Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

It distinguishes between learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts and categorizes them based on injection granularity. The paper also explores the integration of PA in various domains such as medical imaging and vision-language tasks, as well as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune'' paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research, reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains, including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

<title>Sample-Centric Multi-Task Learning for Detection and Segmentation of Industrial Surface Defects</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13226</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> defect inspection, quality control, multi-task learning, sample-level decisions, evaluation metrics<br /><br />Summary:<br />In industrial settings, ensuring the quality of surfaces involves detecting defects accurately. However, common challenges include an imbalance between the defect (foreground) and non-defect (background) areas, sparse distribution of defects, and low visibility due to insufficient contrast. Consequently, traditional pixel-centric approaches falter as they often miss small or low-contrast defects. Current models, while effective in metrics like mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), struggle with stability at the sample level—essential for real-world deployment.
<br />To bridge this gap, the paper introduces a new sample-centric multi-task learning framework that combines defect detection and localization into a single model. This approach employs a shared-encoder architecture where sample-level supervision is used to enhance the detection of smaller and less visually pronounced defects. Simultaneously, a segmentation branch is tasked with maintaining accurate boundaries and shape details, thus improving decision stability on a per-sample basis.
<br />Moreover, the authors propose new evaluation metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, specifically designed to provide a more accurate measurement of model performance by factoring in true negative samples and focusing more closely on the relationship between defect localization and overall sample-based decisions.
<br />Experiments on benchmark datasets show that this method not only boosts the reliability of defect detection at the sample level but also ensures more comprehensive and precise localization of defects. <div>
arXiv:2510.13226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC) must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and, at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

Summary: <br />
The article addresses the issue of affirmative bias in vision-language models, particularly in described object detection tasks. To tackle this, the authors introduce CoVAND, a new dataset generated through a systematic pipeline to provide high-quality negation data. They also propose NegToMe, a text token merging module that addresses the architectural cause of affirmative bias by grouping negation cues with attributes to maintain correct polarity at the input level. This module is integrated with a parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning approach. The method shows significant improvement on challenging negation benchmarks, with a boost in NMS-AP performance by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval. The approach demonstrates generalization to state-of-the-art vision-language models, marking a substantial advancement in addressing negation understanding in real-world detection applications. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.13232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and "girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection applications.

Summary:
The article introduces UniVector, a unified framework for vector extraction from raster images that can handle multiple vector types within a single model. Inspired by human visual perception, UniVector combines instance and geometry information in structured queries and incorporates an interaction module for context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint refines global structures and key points. The Multi-Vector dataset is introduced to benchmark multi-structure scenarios. UniVector outperforms existing methods on both single- and multi-structure vector extraction tasks. The code and dataset for UniVector will be made available on GitHub at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images, offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons, polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures. This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons, polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.

The article introduces a novel multimodal vision-language tracking framework called EPIPTrack, which utilizes explicit and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment. Explicit prompts convert spatial motion information into natural language descriptions to guide tracking, while implicit prompts create individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both prompts are adjusted dynamically using the CLIP text encoder to adapt to changes in the target state. Additionally, a Discriminative Feature Augmentor is employed to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Experimental results on various datasets show that EPIPTrack outperforms existing trackers in different scenarios, showcasing its adaptability and performance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment. Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust adaptability and superior performance.

Summary:<br />
This work introduces a novel adversarial patch attack, EDPA, for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, disrupting semantic alignment and maximizing latent representation discrepancy to cause task failure. A defense strategy involving adversarial fine-tuning of the visual encoder is proposed to mitigate the attack effects. Extensive evaluations on robotic simulation benchmarks show that EDPA significantly increases task failure rates, while the defense mechanism effectively counters the attack. The codebase for implementing these methods is available online at the provided homepage. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.13237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs. Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs. Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at https://edpa-attack.github.io/.

Abstract: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security, urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

<div> Keywords: Video Large Language Models, spatiotemporal inputs, VideoQA, interpretability techniques, temporal reasoning

Summary:<br /><br />
Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) enhance vision-language models to process spatiotemporal inputs for tasks like Video Question Answering (VideoQA). This study delves into the internal information flow of VideoLLMs using interpretability techniques. The analysis uncovers consistent patterns in VideoQA tasks: (1) active cross-frame interactions start temporal reasoning in early-to-middle layers, (2) progressing to video-language integration in middle layers, facilitated by alignment between video representations and temporal linguistic embeddings. (3) After integration, correct answer generation occurs in middle-to-late layers. (4) VideoLLMs maintain performance by selecting effective pathways while suppressing attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT model. These insights offer a guideline on temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs and provide practical improvements for interpretability and generalization in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis, we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

<div> diffusion model, variational autoencoder, multi-modal processing, high-resolution images, text sequences

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba) that aims to improve the joint representation learning of various modalities in multi-modal processing. MDM utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This approach enables MDM to achieve superior performance in processing high-dimensional data, particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences simultaneously. Evaluation results in various tasks such as image generation, image captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks show that MDM outperforms existing end-to-end models like MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon, and competes effectively with state-of-the-art models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. The results validate MDM's effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational efficiency, marking a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal architectures.

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing, we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data, particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models (MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal architectures.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces MMLongCite, a benchmark to assess the fidelity of large vision language models (LVLMs) in handling long contexts. The benchmark includes 8 tasks across different context lengths and modalities like text, images, and videos. Evaluations of current LVLMs show limited faithfulness in long multimodal contexts, highlighting a gap in their effectiveness for real-world applications. The study also analyzes how context length and the position of crucial content impact the faithfulness of LVLMs. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain, while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8 distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of these models.

<div> Classification, image restoration, pre-training, MaskDCPT, dataset

Summary:
MaskDCPT is a new pre-training method introduced in this study for classification of degradation types in input images, enhancing image restoration. It uses weak supervision of degradation type and leverages image reconstruction to improve performance and robustness. The method consists of an encoder and two decoders, one for classification and one for reconstruction. This design facilitates masked image modeling and contrastive learning, leading to a generalized representation for restoration tasks. MaskDCPT significantly improves performance for CNNs and Transformers, showing a minimum 3.77 dB increase in PSNR and a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world scenarios. It also demonstrates strong generalization to unseen degradation types and levels. Additionally, the study introduces the UIR-2.5M dataset with 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19 degradation types and over 200 levels, including synthetic and real-world data. Source code, dataset, and models are available on GitHub at https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MaskDCPT. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method (MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19 degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MaskDCPT.

Abstract: An automatic document classification system is presented that detects textual content in images and classifies documents into four predefined categories (Invoice, Report, Letter, and Form). The system supports both offline images (e.g., files on flash drives, HDDs, microSD) and real-time capture via connected cameras, and is designed to mitigate practical challenges such as variable illumination, arbitrary orientation, curved or partially occluded text, low resolution, and distant text. The pipeline comprises four stages: image capture and preprocessing, text detection [1] using a DBNet++ (Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) detector, and text classification [2] using a BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) classifier, all integrated within a user interface implemented in Python with PyQt5. The achieved results by the system for text detection in images were good at about 92.88% through 10 hours on Total-Text dataset that involve high resolution images simulate a various and very difficult challenges. The results indicate the proposed approach is effective for practical, mixed-source document categorization in unconstrained imaging scenarios.

Summary:
In this paper, the focus is on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation (3D-NCD), aiming to segment unlabeled 3D classes using supervised data from labeled classes. The key is establishing precise correlations between point representations and their class labels, as well as representation correlations between base and novel classes. By introducing a Structural Causal Model (SCM), a new method called Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning is proposed. This method identifies hidden confounders in base class representations, captures causal relationships between base and novel classes, and utilizes a graph structure for causal reasoning. Experiments on 3D and 2D NCD semantic segmentation show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. <div>

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation (3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method, i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

<div> Keywords: Structure-from-Motion, GPU acceleration, bundle adjustment, global positioning, reconstruction accuracy

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach to accelerating Structure-from-Motion (SfM) using GPU parallel computation. Traditional SfM methods like COLMAP and GLOMAP suffer from computational overhead when dealing with large-scale scenarios, impacting speed and accuracy trade-offs. On the other hand, deep learning-based SfM pipelines struggle with scalability due to increasing GPU memory consumption with a higher number of input views. The proposed method leverages GPU parallel computation to significantly speed up both bundle adjustment (BA) and global positioning (GP) stages within a unified global SfM framework. By extending sparse-aware optimization techniques, the method achieves up to a 40x speedup over COLMAP while maintaining comparable or improved reconstruction accuracy. This approach addresses the limitations of existing SfM methods and provides a more efficient and flexible solution for large-scale reconstruction tasks. The project website offers further information and resources for implementing the proposed approach. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.13310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning (GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover, the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework. Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about 40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even improved reconstruction accuracy.

Summary:
This article introduces a novel training-free decoding strategy for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to improve factual consistency in generated outputs. The strategy includes a self-augmentation prompting approach that dynamically aligns semantics between text queries and visual augmentations, enhancing the generation process. Additionally, an adaptive thresholding algorithm adjusts token candidate size based on output sparsity, utilizing logit distribution information. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show significant improvements in factual consistency compared to existing decoding methods. This study emphasizes the importance of integrating query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding to enhance the effective generation of LVLMs. <div>
arXiv:2510.13315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query, limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity, utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective generation of LVLMs.

Abstract: Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods. Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their (commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper understanding of human interest.

Summary:
This article introduces a training strategy that eliminates the need for cost volumes in optical flow estimators during training. By exploiting the observation that cost volumes become less significant after training other parts of the network, the proposed strategy improves inference speed and reduces memory requirements. Three different models are developed using this training approach, with the most accurate model achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while being 1.2 times faster and requiring 6 times less memory than comparable models. The fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at 20 FPS using only 500 MB of GPU memory. <div>
arXiv:2510.13317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets. Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being $1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at $20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel approach for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery utilizing the DEF-YOLO architecture. DEF-YOLO incorporates deformable convolutions and features to enhance object localization in thermal homogeneous regions. The proposed approach addresses the lack of benchmark datasets by introducing the TICW dataset, the first large-scale dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Focal loss is incorporated to handle class imbalance in the task. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed approach, establishing a new benchmark for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. <div>

Abstract: Concealed weapon detection aims at detecting weapons hidden beneath a person's clothing or luggage. Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave, Microwave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon detection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as poor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave imaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features; backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces Group-VQ, a method for improving Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) by performing group-wise optimization on the codebook. This approach addresses issues like codebook collapse by allowing for independent optimization within each group and joint optimization between groups, improving codebook utilization and reconstruction performance. Additionally, a training-free codebook resampling method is introduced to enable adjustment of the codebook size post-training. Experimental results demonstrate that Group-VQ outperforms existing approaches in image reconstruction tasks, showcasing enhanced reconstruction metrics. The post-training codebook sampling method adds desired flexibility by allowing for easy adjustment of the codebook size based on specific requirements. <div>
arXiv:2510.13331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently, with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance. Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

Summary:
The article introduces a new dataset and metric for assessing the quality of rendered videos, important for applications like video games and virtual reality. Existing NR-VQA methods may not accurately evaluate rendered videos due to their susceptibility to temporal artifacts. The dataset includes various 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for different display types. A new NR-VQA metric is proposed, focusing on image quality and temporal stability specific to rendered videos. This metric outperforms existing ones when assessing rendered video quality. Additionally, the metric can be used to benchmark supersampling methods and evaluate frame generation strategies in real-time rendering. <div>
arXiv:2510.13349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality, where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA) methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time rendering.

<div> Keywords: Vision-Language Models, zero-shot classification, prompt design, human postures, performance evaluation

Summary: 
This study explores the impact of prompt specificity on zero-shot classification of human postures using Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The research focuses on sitting, standing, and walking/running categories using a small dataset. Results show that simpler prompts yield better performance for top VLMs such as MetaCLIP 2 and OpenCLIP, indicating a phenomenon termed "prompt overfitting". Adding descriptive detail actually decreases performance in these cases. On the other hand, the SigLip model benefits from more detailed prompts for ambiguous classes. This study highlights the importance of prompt design in achieving accurate zero-shot classification results for visually similar categories like human postures. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood. This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2, and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling, counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

<title>DepthVLA: Enhancing Vision-Language-Action Models with Depth-Aware Spatial Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs. 93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator. Our code will be made publicly available.

<title>Leveraging 2D Priors and SDF Guidance for Dynamic Urban Scene Rendering</title>

Abstract: Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories, without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene composition.

<title>Generalizing WiFi Gesture Recognition via Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13390</link>

Abstract: WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios. Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0 benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world AIoT applications.

<title>Spatial-DISE: A Unified Benchmark for Evaluating Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark, \textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants: \textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic, \textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover, to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions, resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence, especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be publicly released.

<title>Reinforcement Learning Meets Masked Generative Models: Mask-GRPO for Text-to-Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on https://github.com/xingzhejun/Mask-GRPO

<title>Ultra High-Resolution Image Inpainting with Patch-Based Content Consistency Adapter</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13419</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13419</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.13419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

<title>CoDS: Enhancing Collaborative Perception in Heterogeneous Scenarios via Domain Separation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13432</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13432</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.13432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively. Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios. The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation (DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI) loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

<title>Beyond Pixels: A Differentiable Pipeline for Probing Neuronal Selectivity in 3D</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13433</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13433</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.13433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape, pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels, making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting. This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond conventional pixel-based methods.

<title>Near-Infrared Hyperspectral Imaging Applications in Food Analysis -- Improving Algorithms and Methodologies</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13452</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.13452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a 2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still, PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach. Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values. Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally, this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a new algorithm.

<title>VIST3A: Text-to-3D by Stitching a Multi-view Reconstruction Network to a Video Generator</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13454</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.13454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as "generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

<title>Through the Lens of Doubt: Robust and Efficient Uncertainty Estimation for Visual Place Recognition</title>

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty (SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

<title>ExpressNet-MoE: A Hybrid Deep Neural Network for Emotion Recognition</title>

arXiv:2510.13493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential. Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77% on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings. Reproducible codes and results are made publicly accessible at https://github.com/DeeptimaanB/ExpressNet-MoE.

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks. Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model. Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

Abstract: Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones. This is mainly due to transient features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally, like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

<title>Learning Neural Parametric 3D Breast Shape Models for Metrical Surface Reconstruction From Monocular RGB Videos</title>

Abstract: We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach -- inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2 mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at https://rbsm.re-mic.de/local-implicit.

<title>Accelerated Feature Detectors for Visual SLAM: A Comparative Study of FPGA vs GPU</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13546</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13546</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general, and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM (V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM. However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in 2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations (Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western) populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

Abstract: Depth estimation remains central to autonomous driving, and radar-camera fusion offers robustness in adverse conditions by providing complementary geometric cues. In this paper, we present XD-RCDepth, a lightweight architecture that reduces the parameters by 29.7% relative to the state-of-the-art lightweight baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy. To preserve performance under compression and enhance interpretability, we introduce two knowledge-distillation strategies: an explainability-aligned distillation that transfers the teacher's saliency structure to the student, and a depth-distribution distillation that recasts depth regression as soft classification over discretized bins. Together, these components reduce the MAE compared with direct training with 7.97% and deliver competitive accuracy with real-time efficiency on nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam datasets.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion (PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal the effectiveness of PCDF.

Abstract: Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation, healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition research.

Abstract: Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection, accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1 explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future directions for advancing medical image enhancement.

<title>Towards Adversarial Robustness and Uncertainty Quantification in DINOv2-based Few-Shot Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level representations while progressively preserving and refining structural information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation, we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this, EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available at https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/EditCast3D

Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen datasets.

<title>CanvasMAR: Improving Masked Autoregressive Video Generation With Canvas</title>

arXiv:2510.13669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals diffusion-based methods.

<title>Seeing and Knowing in the Wild: Open-domain Visual Entity Recognition with Large-scale Knowledge Graphs via Contrastive Learning</title>

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity, and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy, especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite being 35 times smaller.

Abstract: We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model, which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and efficiency of our method.

<title>Generating healthy counterfactuals with denoising diffusion bridge models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.13684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart. More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) - which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often, the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training. Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks: excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance, and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.

Abstract: Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models. However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps, we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention, which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and customization.

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain, often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However, conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200 stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above 0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development and clinical research.

Abstract: We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple micro lens array (MLA)-based light field cameras. While existing light field datasets are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth, LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-degrees of freedom (DoF) poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods.
  As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust 3D transformation estimation via a RANSAC-based method using cross-view point clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view light field processing.

<title>Cyclic Self-Supervised Diffusion for Ultra Low-field to High-field MRI Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However, synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure correction network enhances local feature restoration through self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR, 0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and anatomically consistent.

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN) and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy, GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3% reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of current state-of-the-art ViGs.

<title>UniCalli: A Unified Diffusion Framework for Column-Level Generation and Recognition of Chinese Calligraphy</title>

Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging. Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce \textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in \href{https://github.com/EnVision-Research/UniCalli}{this URL}.

arXiv:2510.13747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience, particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.13756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering -- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem, but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K, RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration. Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles. Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for advancing unified models.

Abstract: A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation models for fMRI data. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/MedARC-AI/fmri-fm.

<title>Adaptive Visual Conditioning for Semantic Consistency in Diffusion-Based Story Continuation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13787</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13787</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.13787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior visuals conflict with the current input.

<title>NoisePrints: Distortion-Free Watermarks for Authorship in Private Diffusion Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.13793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation, proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access to model weights.

arXiv:2510.13795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness; and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

arXiv:2510.13800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them. Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation, GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely without external modules while delivering performance comparable to state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

arXiv:2510.13802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling, understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video, the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

Abstract: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process. This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3). Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios. Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7), and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods, such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view (exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

Abstract: Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation, proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware video generation and broader applications.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are pivotal for advancing perception in intelligent agents. Yet, evaluation of VLMs remains limited to predominantly English-centric benchmarks in which the image-text pairs comprise short texts. To evaluate VLM fine-grained abilities, in four languages under long-text settings, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark VLURes featuring eight vision-and-language tasks, and a pioneering unrelatedness task, to probe the fine-grained Visual and Linguistic Understanding capabilities of VLMs across English, Japanese, and low-resource languages, Swahili, and Urdu. Our datasets, curated from web resources in the target language, encompass ten diverse image categories and rich textual context, introducing valuable vision-language resources for Swahili and Urdu. By prompting VLMs to generate responses and rationales, evaluated automatically and by native speakers, we uncover performance disparities across languages and tasks critical to intelligent agents, such as object recognition, scene understanding, and relationship understanding. We conducted evaluations of ten VLMs with VLURes. The best performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 90.8% and lags human performance by 6.7%, though the gap is larger for open-source models. The gap highlights VLURes' critical role in developing intelligent agents to tackle multi-modal visual reasoning.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies often struggle to generalize to novel objects, limiting their real-world utility. In contrast, cognitive science suggests that children develop generalizable dexterous manipulation skills by mastering a small set of simple toys and then applying that knowledge to more complex items. Inspired by this, we study if similar generalization capabilities can also be achieved by robots. Our results indicate robots can learn generalizable grasping using randomly assembled objects that are composed from just four shape primitives: spheres, cuboids, cylinders, and rings. We show that training on these "toys" enables robust generalization to real-world objects, yielding strong zero-shot performance. Crucially, we find the key to this generalization is an object-centric visual representation induced by our proposed detection pooling mechanism. Evaluated in both simulation and on physical robots, our model achieves a 67% real-world grasping success rate on the YCB dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches that rely on substantially more in-domain data. We further study how zero-shot generalization performance scales by varying the number and diversity of training toys and the demonstrations per toy. We believe this work offers a promising path to scalable and generalizable learning in robotic manipulation. Demonstration videos, code, checkpoints and our dataset are available on our project page: https://lego-grasp.github.io/ .

Abstract: Safe large-scale coordination of multiple cooperative connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) hinges on communication that is both efficient and interpretable. Existing approaches either rely on transmitting high-bandwidth raw sensor data streams or neglect perception and planning uncertainties inherent in shared data, resulting in systems that are neither scalable nor safe. To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Natural Language Cooperative Autonomous Planning (UNCAP), a vision-language model-based planning approach that enables CAVs to communicate via lightweight natural language messages while explicitly accounting for perception uncertainty in decision-making. UNCAP features a two-stage communication protocol: (i) an ego CAV first identifies the subset of vehicles most relevant for information exchange, and (ii) the selected CAVs then transmit messages that quantitatively express their perception uncertainty. By selectively fusing messages that maximize mutual information, this strategy allows the ego vehicle to integrate only the most relevant signals into its decision-making, improving both the scalability and reliability of cooperative planning. Experiments across diverse driving scenarios show a 63% reduction in communication bandwidth with a 31% increase in driving safety score, a 61% reduction in decision uncertainty, and a four-fold increase in collision distance margin during near-miss events.

Abstract: On large-scale e-commerce platforms with tens of millions of active monthly users, recommending visually similar products is essential for enabling users to efficiently discover items that align with their preferences. This study presents the application of a vision-language model (VLM) -- which has demonstrated strong performance in image recognition and image-text retrieval tasks -- to product recommendations on Mercari, a major consumer-to-consumer marketplace used by more than 20 million monthly users in Japan. Specifically, we fine-tuned SigLIP, a VLM employing a sigmoid-based contrastive loss, using one million product image-title pairs from Mercari collected over a three-month period, and developed an image encoder for generating item embeddings used in the recommendation system. Our evaluation comprised an offline analysis of historical interaction logs and an online A/B test in a production environment.

<title>Steerable Conditional Diffusion for Domain Adaptation in PET Image Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently enabled state-of-the-art reconstruction of positron emission tomography (PET) images while requiring only image training data. However, domain shift remains a key concern for clinical adoption: priors trained on images from one anatomy, acquisition protocol or pathology may produce artefacts on out-of-distribution data. We propose integrating steerable conditional diffusion (SCD) with our previously-introduced likelihood-scheduled diffusion (PET-LiSch) framework to improve the alignment of the diffusion model's prior to the target subject. At reconstruction time, for each diffusion step, we use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to align the diffusion model prior with the target domain on the fly. Experiments on realistic synthetic 2D brain phantoms demonstrate that our approach suppresses hallucinated artefacts under domain shift, i.e. when our diffusion model is trained on perturbed images and tested on normal anatomy, our approach suppresses the hallucinated structure, outperforming both OSEM and diffusion model baselines qualitatively and quantitatively. These results provide a proof-of-concept that steerable priors can mitigate domain shift in diffusion-based PET reconstruction and motivate future evaluation on real data.

<title>An efficient approach with theoretical guarantees to simultaneously reconstruct activity and attenuation sinogram for TOF-PET</title>

Abstract: In positron emission tomography (PET), it is indispensable to perform attenuation correction in order to obtain the quantitatively accurate activity map (tracer distribution) in the body. Generally, this is carried out based on the estimated attenuation map obtained from computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. However, except for errors in the attenuation correction factors obtained, the additional scan not only brings in new radiation doses and/or increases the scanning time but also leads to severe misalignment induced by various motions during and between the two sequential scans. To address these issues, based on maximum likelihood estimation, we propose a new mathematical model for simultaneously reconstructing the activity and attenuation sinogram from the time-of-flight (TOF)-PET emission data only. Particularly, we make full use of the exclusively exponential form for the attenuation correction factors, and consider the constraint of a total amount of the activity in some mask region in the proposed model. Furthermore, we prove its well-posedness, including the existence, uniqueness and stability of the solution. We propose an alternating update algorithm to solve the model, and also analyze its convergence. Finally, numerical experiments with various TOF-PET emission data demonstrate that the proposed method is of numerical convergence and robust to noise, and outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and has the capability of autonomous attenuation correction.

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout, camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.

Abstract: Remote inference allows lightweight devices to leverage powerful cloud models. However, communication network latency makes predictions stale and unsuitable for real-time tasks. To address this, we introduce Dedelayed, a delay-corrective method that mitigates arbitrary remote inference delays, allowing the local device to produce low-latency outputs in real time. Our method employs a lightweight local model that processes the current frame and fuses in features that a heavyweight remote model computes from past frames. On video from the BDD100K driving dataset, Dedelayed improves semantic segmentation accuracy over the stronger of the local-only and remote-only baselines across all realistic communication network delays beyond 33 ms. Without incurring additional delay, it improves accuracy by 6.4 mIoU compared to fully local inference and 9.8 mIoU compared to remote inference, for a round-trip delay of 100 ms. The advantage grows under longer delays and higher-motion scenes, as delay-mitigated split inference sustains accuracy more effectively, providing clear advantages for real-time tasks that must remain aligned with the current world state.

Abstract: Next-generation multimodal foundation models capable of any-to-any cross-modal generation and multi-turn interaction will serve as core components of artificial general intelligence systems, playing a pivotal role in human-machine interaction. However, most existing multimodal models remain constrained by autoregressive architectures, whose inherent limitations prevent a balanced integration of understanding and generation capabilities. Although hybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks within unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs limit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal retrieval.In this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal foundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths and kinetic optimal velocities, NExT-OMNI natively supports any-to-any understanding and generation with enhanced response efficiency, while enabling broader application scenarios through concise unified representations rather than task-decoupled designs. Trained on large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and audio data, NExT-OMNI delivers competitive performance on multimodal generation and understanding benchmarks, while outperforming prior unified models in multi-turn multimodal interaction and cross-modal retrieval, highlighting its architectural advantages as a next-generation multimodal foundation model. To advance further research, we release training details, data protocols, and open-source both the code and model checkpoints.

Abstract: Forecasting urban phenomena such as housing prices and public health indicators requires the effective integration of various geospatial data. Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data, cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training. UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability across diverse data availability scenarios. All source code is available at https://github.com/DominikM198/UrbanFusion.

Abstract: We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework for spatial grounding and robot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable, general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual, embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box, point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes, enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.

Abstract: Symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990) describes how symbols such as words acquire their meanings by connecting to real-world sensorimotor experiences. Recent work has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in (vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding objectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that drive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a controlled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding arises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal analysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer computations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where attention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of linguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across architectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional LSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol grounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for predicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.

Abstract: Conventional de-noising methods rely on the assumption that all samples are independent and identically distributed, so the resultant classifier, though disturbed by noise, can still easily identify the noises as the outliers of training distribution. However, the assumption is unrealistic in large-scale data that is inevitably long-tailed. Such imbalanced training data makes a classifier less discriminative for the tail classes, whose previously "easy" noises are now turned into "hard" ones -- they are almost as outliers as the clean tail samples. We introduce this new challenge as Noisy Long-Tailed Classification (NLT). Not surprisingly, we find that most de-noising methods fail to identify the hard noises, resulting in significant performance drop on the three proposed NLT benchmarks: ImageNet-NLT, Animal10-NLT, and Food101-NLT. To this end, we design an iterative noisy learning framework called Hard-to-Easy (H2E). Our bootstrapping philosophy is to first learn a classifier as noise identifier invariant to the class and context distributional changes, reducing "hard" noises to "easy" ones, whose removal further improves the invariance. Experimental results show that our H2E outperforms state-of-the-art de-noising methods and their ablations on long-tailed settings while maintaining a stable performance on the conventional balanced settings.

Abstract: With the rise of social platforms, protecting privacy has become an important issue. Privacy object detection aims to accurately locate private objects in images. It is the foundation of safeguarding individuals' privacy rights and ensuring responsible data handling practices in the digital age. Since privacy of object is not shift-invariant, the essence of the privacy object detection task is inferring object privacy based on scene information. However, privacy object detection has long been studied as a subproblem of common object detection tasks. Therefore, existing methods suffer from serious deficiencies in accuracy, generalization, and interpretability. Moreover, creating large-scale privacy datasets is difficult due to legal constraints and existing privacy datasets lack label granularity. The granularity of existing privacy detection methods remains limited to the image level. To address the above two issues, we introduce two benchmark datasets for object-level privacy detection and propose SHAN, Scene Heterogeneous graph Attention Network, a model constructs a scene heterogeneous graph from an image and utilizes self-attention mechanisms for scene inference to obtain object privacy. Through experiments, we demonstrated that SHAN performs excellently in privacy object detection tasks, with all metrics surpassing those of the baseline model.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) and Neural Fields are a novel paradigm for signal representation, from images and audio to 3D scenes and videos. The fundamental idea is to represent a signal as a continuous and differentiable neural network. This new approach poses new theoretical questions and challenges. Considering a neural image as a 2D image represented as a neural network, we aim to explore novel neural image compression. In this work, we present a novel analysis on compressing neural fields, with focus on images and introduce Adaptive Neural Images (ANI), an efficient neural representation that enables adaptation to different inference or transmission requirements. Our proposed method allows us to reduce the bits-per-pixel (bpp) of the neural image by 8 times, without losing sensitive details or harming fidelity. Our work offers a new framework for developing compressed neural fields. We achieve a new state-of-the-art in terms of PSNR/bpp trade-off thanks to our successful implementation of 4-bit neural representations.

Abstract: The Privacy-sensitive Object Identification (POI) task allocates bounding boxes for privacy-sensitive objects in a scene. The key to POI is settling an object's privacy class (privacy-sensitive or non-privacy-sensitive). In contrast to conventional object classes which are determined by the visual appearance of an object, one object's privacy class is derived from the scene contexts and is subject to various implicit factors beyond its visual appearance. That is, visually similar objects may be totally opposite in their privacy classes. To explicitly derive the objects' privacy class from the scene contexts, in this paper, we interpret the POI task as a visual reasoning task aimed at the privacy of each object in the scene. Following this interpretation, we propose the PrivacyGuard framework for POI. PrivacyGuard contains three stages. i) Structuring: an unstructured image is first converted into a structured, heterogeneous scene graph that embeds rich scene contexts. ii) Data Augmentation: a contextual perturbation oversampling strategy is proposed to create slightly perturbed privacy-sensitive objects in a scene graph, thereby balancing the skewed distribution of privacy classes. iii) Hybrid Graph Generation & Reasoning: the balanced, heterogeneous scene graph is then transformed into a hybrid graph by endowing it with extra "node-node" and "edge-edge" homogeneous paths. These homogeneous paths allow direct message passing between nodes or edges, thereby accelerating reasoning and facilitating the capturing of subtle context changes. Based on this hybrid graph... **For the full abstract, see the original paper.**

Abstract: Zero-shot classification capabilities naturally arise in models trained within a vision-language contrastive framework. Despite their classification prowess, these models struggle in dense tasks like zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation. This deficiency is often attributed to the absence of localization cues in captions and the intertwined nature of the learning process, which encompasses both image representation learning and cross-modality alignment. To tackle these issues, we propose SimZSS, a Simple framework for open-vocabulary Zero-Shot Segmentation. The method is founded on two key principles: i) leveraging frozen vision-only models that exhibit spatial awareness while exclusively aligning the text encoder and ii) exploiting the discrete nature of text and linguistic knowledge to pinpoint local concepts within captions. By capitalizing on the quality of the visual representations, our method requires only image-caption pairs datasets and adapts to both small curated and large-scale noisy datasets. When trained on COCO Captions across 8 GPUs, SimZSS achieves state-of-the-art results on 7 out of 8 benchmark datasets in less than 15 minutes.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are a novel paradigm for signal representation that have attracted considerable interest for image compression. INRs offer unprecedented advantages in signal resolution and memory efficiency, enabling new possibilities for compression techniques. However, the existing limitations of INRs for image compression have not been sufficiently addressed in the literature. In this work, we explore the critical yet overlooked limiting factors of INRs, such as computational cost, unstable performance, and robustness. Through extensive experiments and empirical analysis, we provide a deeper and more nuanced understanding of implicit neural image compression methods such as Fourier Feature Networks and Siren. Our work also offers valuable insights for future research in this area.

Abstract: The automatic assembly problem has attracted increasing interest due to its complex challenges that involve 3D representation. This paper introduces Jigsaw++, a novel generative method designed to tackle the multifaceted challenges of reconstructing complete shape for the reassembly problem. Existing approach focusing primarily on piecewise information for both part and fracture assembly, often overlooking the integration of complete object prior. Jigsaw++ distinguishes itself by learning a shape prior of complete objects. It employs the proposed "retargeting" strategy that effectively leverages the output of any existing assembly method to generate complete shape reconstructions. This capability allows it to function orthogonally to the current methods. Through extensive evaluations on Breaking Bad dataset and PartNet, Jigsaw++ has demonstrated its effectiveness, reducing reconstruction errors and enhancing the precision of shape reconstruction, which sets a new direction for future reassembly model developments.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have witnessed significant progress on visual understanding tasks. However, they often prioritize language knowledge over image information on visual reasoning tasks, incurring performance degradation. To tackle this issue, we first identify the drawbacks of existing solutions (i.e., limited multi-modal reasoning capacities, and insufficient and irrelevant visual descriptions). We then decompose visual reasoning process into two stages: proactive visual perception (i.e., eyesight) and textual reasoning (i.e., wisdom), and introduce a novel visual reasoning framework named ProReason. This framework features decoupled vision-reasoning capabilities and multi-run proactive perception. Briefly, given a multi-modal question, ProReason iterates proactive information collection and reasoning until the answer can be concluded with necessary and sufficient visual descriptions. Notably, the disassociation of capabilities allows seamless integration of existing large language models (LLMs) to compensate for the reasoning deficits of LVLMs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ProReason outperforms existing multi-step reasoning frameworks on various benchmarks for both open-source and closed-source models, with the average performance gain reaching 13.2%. Besides, the integration of LLMs allows ProReason to produce high-quality visual reasoning data, which empowers ProReason-distilled models (i.e., ProReason-VL and ProReason-Q3) to achieve superior performance in downstream tasks. Our insights into existing solutions and the decoupled perspective for feasible integration of LLMs illuminate future research on visual reasoning techniques, especially LLM-assisted ones.

Abstract: In light of the dynamic nature of autonomous driving environments and stringent safety requirements, general MLLMs combined with CLIP alone often struggle to accurately represent driving-specific scenarios, particularly in complex interactions and long-tail cases. To address this, we propose the Hints of Prompt (HoP) framework, which introduces three key enhancements: Affinity hint to emphasize instance-level structure by strengthening token-wise connections, Semantic hint to incorporate high-level information relevant to driving-specific cases, such as complex interactions among vehicles and traffic signs, and Question hint to align visual features with the query context, focusing on question-relevant regions. These hints are fused through a Hint Fusion module, enriching visual representations by capturing driving-related representations with limited domain data, ensuring faster adaptation to driving scenarios. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the HoP framework, showing that it significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in all key metrics.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation remains a critical challenge in enabling the knowledge transfer of models across unseen domains. Existing methods struggle to balance the need for domain-invariant representations with preserving domain-specific features, which is often due to alignment approaches that impose the projection of samples with similar semantics close in the latent space despite their drastic domain differences. We introduce a novel approach that shifts the focus from aligning representations in absolute coordinates to aligning the relative positioning of equivalent concepts in latent spaces. Our method defines a domain-agnostic structure upon the semantic/geometric relationships between class labels in language space and guides adaptation, ensuring that the organization of samples in visual space reflects reference inter-class relationships while preserving domain-specific characteristics. We empirically demonstrate our method's superiority in domain adaptation tasks across four diverse image and video datasets. Remarkably, we surpass previous works in 18 different adaptation scenarios across four diverse image and video datasets with average accuracy improvements of +3.32% on DomainNet, +5.75% in GeoPlaces, +4.77% on GeoImnet, and +1.94% mean class accuracy improvement on EgoExo4D.

Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in collecting large-scale datasets to improve segmentation and autonomous driving models. These large-scale datasets are often dominated by common environmental conditions such as "Clear and Day" weather, leading to decreased performance in under-represented conditions like "Rainy and Night". To address this issue, we introduce SynDiff-AD, a novel data augmentation pipeline that leverages diffusion models (DMs) to generate realistic images for such subgroups. SynDiff-AD uses ControlNet-a DM that guides data generation conditioned on semantic maps-along with a novel prompting scheme that generates subgroup-specific, semantically dense prompts. By augmenting datasets with SynDiff-AD, we improve the performance of segmentation models like Mask2Former and SegFormer by up to 1.2% and 2.3% on the Waymo dataset, and up to 1.4% and 0.7% on the DeepDrive dataset, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate that our SynDiff-AD pipeline enhances the driving performance of end-to-end autonomous driving models, like AIM-2D and AIM-BEV, by up to 20% across diverse environmental conditions in the CARLA autonomous driving simulator, providing a more robust model. We release our code and pipeline at https://github.com/UTAustin-SwarmLab/SynDiff-AD.

Prior KD techniques typically assume homogeneity between the teacher and student models. However, as technology advances, a wide variety of architectures have emerged, ranging from initial Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Multi-Level Perceptrons (MLPs). Consequently, developing a universal KD framework compatible with any architecture has become an important research topic. In this paper, we introduce a perspective-aware teaching (PAT) KD framework to enable feature distillation across diverse architectures. Our framework comprises two key components. First, we design prompt tuning blocks that incorporate student feedback, allowing teacher features to adapt to the student model's learning process. Second, we propose region-aware attention to mitigate the view mismatch problem between heterogeneous architectures. By leveraging these two modules, effective distillation of intermediate features can be achieved across heterogeneous architectures. Extensive experiments on CIFAR, ImageNet, and COCO demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Our code is available at https://github.com/jimmylin0979/PAT.git.

Abstract: We propose MotionAgent, enabling fine-grained motion control for text-guided image-to-video generation. The key technique is the motion field agent that converts motion information in text prompts into explicit motion fields, providing flexible and precise motion guidance. Specifically, the agent extracts the object movement and camera motion described in the text and converts them into object trajectories and camera extrinsics, respectively. An analytical optical flow composition module integrates these motion representations in 3D space and projects them into a unified optical flow. An optical flow adapter takes the flow to control the base image-to-video diffusion model for generating fine-grained controlled videos. The significant improvement in the Video-Text Camera Motion metrics on VBench indicates that our method achieves precise control over camera motion. We construct a subset of VBench to evaluate the alignment of motion information in the text and the generated video, outperforming other advanced models on motion generation accuracy.

Abstract: Visual instruction tuning adapts pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to follow human instructions for real-world applications. However, the rapid growth of these datasets introduces significant redundancy, leading to increased computational costs. Existing methods for selecting instruction data aim to prune this redundancy, but predominantly rely on computationally demanding techniques such as proxy-based inference or training-based metrics. Consequently, the substantial computational costs incurred by these selection processes often exacerbate the very efficiency bottlenecks they are intended to resolve, posing a significant challenge to the scalable and effective tuning of MLLMs. To address this challenge, we first identify a critical, yet previously overlooked, factor: the anisotropy inherent in visual feature distributions. We find that this anisotropy induces a \textit{Global Semantic Drift}, and overlooking this phenomenon is a key factor limiting the efficiency of current data selection methods. Motivated by this insight, we devise \textbf{PRISM}, the first training-free framework for efficient visual instruction selection. PRISM surgically removes the corrupting influence of global background features by modeling the intrinsic visual semantics via implicit re-centering. Empirically, PRISM reduces the end-to-end time for data selection and model tuning to just 30\% of conventional pipelines. More remarkably, it achieves this efficiency while simultaneously enhancing performance, surpassing models fine-tuned on the full dataset across eight multimodal and three language understanding benchmarks, culminating in a 101.7\% relative improvement over the baseline. The code is available for access via \href{https://github.com/bibisbar/PRISM}{this repository}.

<title>ChA-MAEViT: Unifying Channel-Aware Masked Autoencoders and Multi-Channel Vision Transformers for Improved Cross-Channel Learning</title>

Abstract: Prior work using Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) typically relies on random patch masking based on the assumption that images have significant redundancies across different channels, allowing for the reconstruction of masked content using cross-channel correlations. However, this assumption does not hold in Multi-Channel Imaging (MCI), where channels may provide complementary information with minimal feature overlap. Thus, these MAEs primarily learn local structures within individual channels from patch reconstruction, failing to fully leverage cross-channel interactions and limiting their MCI effectiveness. In this paper, we present ChA-MAEViT, an MAE-based method that enhances feature learning across MCI channels via four key strategies: (1) dynamic channel-patch masking, which compels the model to reconstruct missing channels in addition to masked patches, thereby enhancing cross-channel dependencies and improving robustness to varying channel configurations; (2) memory tokens, which serve as long-term memory aids to promote information sharing across channels, addressing the challenges of reconstructing structurally diverse channels; (3) hybrid token fusion module, which merges fine-grained patch tokens with a global class token to capture richer representations; and (4) Channel-Aware Decoder, a lightweight decoder utilizes channel tokens to effectively reconstruct image patches. Experiments on satellite and microscopy datasets, CHAMMI, JUMP-CP, and So2Sat, show that ChA-MAEViT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MCI-ViTs by 3.0-21.5%, highlighting the importance of cross-channel interactions in MCI.

Abstract: The effectiveness of autonomous vehicles relies on reliable perception capabilities. Despite significant advancements in artificial intelligence and sensor fusion technologies, current single-vehicle perception systems continue to encounter limitations, notably visual occlusions and limited long-range detection capabilities. Collaborative Perception (CP), enabled by Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication, has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate these issues and enhance the reliability of autonomous systems. Beyond advancements in communication, the computer vision community is increasingly focusing on improving vehicular perception through collaborative approaches. However, a systematic literature review that thoroughly examines existing work and reduces subjective bias is still lacking. Such a systematic approach helps identify research gaps, recognize common trends across studies, and inform future research directions. In response, this study follows the PRISMA 2020 guidelines and includes 106 peer-reviewed articles. These publications are analyzed based on modalities, collaboration schemes, and key perception tasks. Through a comparative analysis, this review illustrates how different methods address practical issues such as pose errors, temporal latency, communication constraints, domain shifts, heterogeneity, and adversarial attacks. Furthermore, it critically examines evaluation methodologies, highlighting a misalignment between current metrics and CP's fundamental objectives. By delving into all relevant topics in-depth, this review offers valuable insights into challenges, opportunities, and risks, serving as a reference for advancing research in vehicular collaborative perception.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection and segmentation methods train a model to learn the training distribution as `normal'. In the testing phase, they identify patterns that deviate from this normal distribution as `anomalies'. To learn the `normal' distribution, prevailing methods
  corrupt the images and train a model to reconstruct them. During testing, the model attempts to reconstruct corrupted inputs based on the learned `normal' distribution. Deviations from this distribution lead to high reconstruction errors, which indicate potential anomalies. However, corrupting an input image inevitably causes information loss even in normal regions, leading to suboptimal reconstruction and an increased risk of false positives. To alleviate this, we propose $\rm{IterMask3D}$, an iterative spatial mask-refining strategy designed for 3D brain MRI. We iteratively spatially mask areas of the image as corruption and reconstruct them, then shrink the mask based on reconstruction error. This process iteratively unmasks `normal' areas to the model, whose information further guides reconstruction of `normal' patterns under the mask to be reconstructed accurately, reducing false positives. In addition, to achieve better reconstruction performance, we also propose using high-frequency image content as additional structural information to guide the reconstruction of the masked area. Extensive experiments on the detection of both synthetic and real-world imaging artifacts, as well as segmentation of various pathological lesions across multiple MRI sequences, consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have significantly advanced semantic segmentation performance. However, their adaptation to new target domains remains challenged by distribution shifts, which often disrupt global attention mechanisms. While existing global and patch-level adaptation methods offer some improvements, they overlook the spatially varying transferability inherent in different image regions. To address this, we propose the Transferable Mask Transformer (TMT), a region-adaptive framework designed to enhance cross-domain representation learning through transferability guidance. First, we dynamically partition the image into coherent regions, grouped by structural and semantic similarity, and estimates their domain transferability at a localized level. Then, we incorporate region-level transferability maps directly into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, allowing the model to adaptively focus attention on areas with lower transferability and higher semantic uncertainty. Extensive experiments across 20 diverse cross-domain settings demonstrate that TMT not only mitigates the performance degradation typically associated with domain shift but also consistently outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is crucial for document digitization, but handwritten data can contain user-identifiable features, like unique writing styles, posing privacy risks. Regulations such as the ``right to be forgotten'' require models to remove these sensitive traces without full retraining. We introduce a practical encoder-only transformer baseline as a robust reference for future HTR research. Building on this, we propose a two-stage unlearning framework for multihead transformer HTR models. Our method combines neural pruning with machine unlearning applied to a writer classification head, ensuring sensitive information is removed while preserving the recognition head. We also present Writer-ID Confusion (WIC), a method that forces the forget set to follow a uniform distribution over writer identities, unlearning user-specific cues while maintaining text recognition performance. We compare WIC to Random Labeling, Fisher Forgetting, Amnesiac Unlearning, and DELETE within our prune-unlearn pipeline and consistently achieve better privacy and accuracy trade-offs. This is the first systematic study of machine unlearning for HTR. Using metrics such as Accuracy, Character Error Rate (CER), Word Error Rate (WER), and Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on the IAM and CVL datasets, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art or superior performance for effective unlearning. These experiments show that our approach effectively safeguards privacy without compromising accuracy, opening new directions for document analysis research. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/leitro/WIC-WriterIDConfusion-MachineUnlearning.

Abstract: We present Human Motions with Objects (HUMOTO), a high-fidelity dataset of human-object interactions for motion generation, computer vision, and robotics applications. Featuring 735 sequences (7,875 seconds at 30 fps), HUMOTO captures interactions with 63 precisely modeled objects and 72 articulated parts. Our innovations include a scene-driven LLM scripting pipeline creating complete, purposeful tasks with natural progression, and a mocap-and-camera recording setup to effectively handle occlusions. Spanning diverse activities from cooking to outdoor picnics, HUMOTO preserves both physical accuracy and logical task flow. Professional artists rigorously clean and verify each sequence, minimizing foot sliding and object penetrations. We also provide benchmarks compared to other datasets. HUMOTO's comprehensive full-body motion and simultaneous multi-object interactions address key data-capturing challenges and provide opportunities to advance realistic human-object interaction modeling across research domains with practical applications in animation, robotics, and embodied AI systems.

Abstract: We present a neural network structure, FramePack, to train next-frame (or next-frame-section) prediction models for video generation. FramePack compresses input frame contexts with frame-wise importance so that more frames can be encoded within a fixed context length, with more important frames having longer contexts. The frame importance can be measured using time proximity, feature similarity, or hybrid metrics. The packing method allows for inference with thousands of frames and training with relatively large batch sizes. We also present drift prevention methods to address observation bias (error accumulation), including early-established endpoints, adjusted sampling orders, and discrete history representation. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the anti-drifting methods in both single-directional video streaming and bi-directional video generation. Finally, we show that existing video diffusion models can be finetuned with FramePack, and analyze the differences between different packing schedules.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) in psychotherapy; however, text-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) models often struggle with client resistance, which can weaken therapeutic alliance. To address this, we propose a multimodal approach that incorporates nonverbal cues, which allows the AI therapist to better align its responses with the client's negative emotional state. Specifically, we introduce a new synthetic dataset, Mirror (Multimodal Interactive Rolling with Resistance), which is a novel synthetic dataset that pairs each client's statements with corresponding facial images. Using this dataset, we train baseline vision language models (VLMs) so that they can analyze facial cues, infer emotions, and generate empathetic responses to effectively manage client resistance. These models are then evaluated in terms of both their counseling skills as a therapist, and the strength of therapeutic alliance in the presence of client resistance. Our results demonstrate that Mirror significantly enhances the AI therapist's ability to handle resistance, which outperforms existing text-based CBT approaches. Human expert evaluations further confirm the effectiveness of our approach in managing client resistance and fostering therapeutic alliance.

Abstract: With the exacerbation of the biodiversity and climate crises, macroecological pursuits such as global biodiversity mapping become more urgent. Remote sensing offers a wealth of Earth observation data for ecological studies, but the scarcity of labeled datasets remains a major challenge. Recently, self-supervised learning has enabled learning representations from unlabeled data, triggering the development of pretrained geospatial models with generalizable features. However, these models are often trained on datasets biased toward areas of high human activity, leaving entire ecological regions underrepresented. Additionally, while some datasets attempt to address seasonality through multi-date imagery, they typically follow calendar seasons rather than local phenological cycles. To better capture vegetation seasonality at a global scale, we propose a simple phenology-informed sampling strategy and introduce corresponding SSL4Eco, a multi-date Sentinel-2 dataset, on which we train an existing model with a season-contrastive objective. We compare representations learned from SSL4Eco against other datasets on diverse ecological downstream tasks and demonstrate that our straightforward sampling method consistently improves representation quality, highlighting the importance of dataset construction. The model pretrained on SSL4Eco reaches state of the art performance on 7 out of 8 downstream tasks spanning (multi-label) classification and regression. We release our code, data, and model weights to support macroecological and computer vision research at https://github.com/PlekhanovaElena/ssl4eco.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a promising backbone for vision tasks due to their linear complexity and global receptive field. However, in the context of Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE), the standard sequential scanning mechanism is fundamentally challenged by the unique statistical distribution characteristics of underwater scenes. The predominance of large-portion, homogeneous but useless oceanic backgrounds can dilute the feature representation responses of sparse yet valuable targets, thereby impeding effective state propagation and compromising the model's ability to preserve both local semantics and global structure. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Value-Driven Reordering Scanning framework for UIE, termed VRS-UIE. Its core innovation is a Multi-Granularity Value Guidance Learning (MVGL) module that generates a pixel-aligned value map to dynamically reorder the SSM's scanning sequence. This prioritizes informative regions to facilitate the long-range state propagation of salient features. Building upon the MVGL, we design a Mamba-Conv Mixer (MCM) block that synergistically integrates priority-driven global sequencing with dynamically adjusted local convolutions, thereby effectively modeling both large-portion oceanic backgrounds and high-value semantic targets. A Cross-Feature Bridge (CFB) further refines multi-level feature fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VRS-UIE framework sets a new state-of-the-art, delivering superior enhancement performance (surpassing WMamba by 0.89 dB on average) by effectively suppressing water bias and preserving structural and color fidelity. Furthermore, by incorporating efficient convolutional operators and resolution rescaling, we construct a light-weight yet effective scheme, VRS-UIE-S, suitable for real-time UIE applications.

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) seeks to predict the perceptual quality of a video in alignment with human visual perception, serving as a fundamental tool for quantifying quality degradation across video processing workflows. The dominant VQA paradigm relies on supervised training with human-labeled datasets, which, despite substantial progress, still suffers from poor generalization to unseen video content. Moreover, its reliance on human annotations -- which are labor-intensive and costly -- makes it difficult to scale datasets for improving model generalization. In this work, we explore weak-to-strong (W2S) learning as a new paradigm for advancing VQA without reliance on large-scale human-labeled datasets. We first provide empirical evidence that a straightforward W2S strategy allows a strong student model to not only match its weak teacher on in-domain benchmarks but also surpass it on out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks, revealing a distinct weak-to-strong effect in VQA. Building on this insight, we propose a novel framework that enhances W2S learning from two aspects: (1) integrating homogeneous and heterogeneous supervision signals from diverse VQA teachers -- including off-the-shelf VQA models and synthetic distortion simulators -- via a learn-to-rank formulation, and (2) iterative W2S training, where each strong student is recycled as the teacher in subsequent cycles, progressively focusing on challenging cases. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results across both in-domain and OOD benchmarks, with especially strong gains in OOD scenarios. Our findings highlight W2S learning as a principled route to break annotation barriers and achieve scalable generalization in VQA, with implications extending to broader alignment and evaluation tasks.

Abstract: The rapid spread of multimodal misinformation on social media has raised growing concerns, while research on video misinformation detection remains limited due to the lack of large-scale, diverse datasets. Existing methods often overfit to rigid templates and lack deep reasoning over deceptive content. To address these challenges, we introduce FakeVV, a large-scale benchmark comprising over 100,000 video-text pairs with fine-grained, interpretable annotations. In addition, we further propose Fact-R1, a novel framework that integrates deep reasoning with collaborative rule-based reinforcement learning. Fact-R1 is trained through a three-stage process: (1) misinformation long-Chain-of-Thought (CoT) instruction tuning, (2) preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using a novel verifiable reward function. This enables Fact-R1 to exhibit emergent reasoning behaviors comparable to those observed in advanced text-based reinforcement learning systems, but in the more complex multimodal misinformation setting. Our work establishes a new paradigm for misinformation detection, bridging large-scale video understanding, reasoning-guided alignment, and interpretable verification.

Abstract: Driving simulation plays a crucial role in developing reliable driving agents by providing controlled, evaluative environments. To enable meaningful assessments, a high-quality driving simulator must satisfy several key requirements: multi-modal sensing capabilities (e.g., camera and LiDAR) with realistic scene rendering to minimize observational discrepancies; closed-loop evaluation to support free-form trajectory behaviors; highly diverse traffic scenarios for thorough evaluation; multi-agent cooperation to capture interaction dynamics; and high computational efficiency to ensure affordability and scalability. However, existing simulators and benchmarks fail to comprehensively meet these fundamental criteria. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces RealEngine, a novel driving simulation framework that holistically integrates 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis techniques to achieve realistic and flexible closed-loop simulation in the driving context. By leveraging real-world multi-modal sensor data, RealEngine reconstructs background scenes and foreground traffic participants separately, allowing for highly diverse and realistic traffic scenarios through flexible scene composition. This synergistic fusion of scene reconstruction and view synthesis enables photorealistic rendering across multiple sensor modalities, ensuring both perceptual fidelity and geometric accuracy. Building upon this environment, RealEngine supports three essential driving simulation categories: non-reactive simulation, safety testing, and multi-agent interaction, collectively forming a reliable and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the real-world performance of driving agents.

Abstract: MLLMs have demonstrated significant visual understanding capabilities, yet their fine-grained visual perception in complex real-world scenarios, such as densely crowded public areas, remains limited. Inspired by the recent success of RL in both LLMs and MLLMs, in this paper, we explore how RL can enhance visual perception ability of MLLMs. Then we develop a novel RL-based framework, Deep Inspection and Perception with RL (DIP-R1) designed to enhance the visual perception capabilities of MLLMs, by comprehending complex scenes and looking through visual instances closely. DIP-R1 guides MLLMs through detailed inspection of visual scene via three simply designed rule-based reward modeling. First, we adopt a standard reasoning reward encouraging the model to include three-step reasoning process: 1) comprehending entire visual scene, 2) observing for looking through interested but ambiguous regions, and 3) decision-making for predicting answer. Second, a variance-guided looking reward is designed to encourage MLLM to examine uncertain regions during the observing process, guiding it to inspect ambiguous areas and mitigate perceptual uncertainty. This reward promotes variance-driven visual exploration, enabling MLLM to reason about region-level uncertainty and explicitly indicate interpretable uncertain regions. Third, we model a weighted precision-recall accuracy reward enhancing accurate decision-making. We verify its effectiveness across diverse fine-grained object detection data consisting of challenging real-world scenes, such as densely crowded scenes. Built upon existing MLLMs, DIP-R1 achieves consistent and significant improvement across various in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, outperforming various existing baselines and SFT method. Our findings highlight the substantial potential of integrating RL into MLLMs for enhancing capabilities in complex real-world perception tasks.

Abstract: Generative diffusion models learn probability densities over diverse image datasets by estimating the score with a neural network trained to remove noise. Despite their remarkable success in generating high-quality images, the internal mechanisms of the underlying score networks are not well understood. Here, we examine the image representation that arises from score estimation in a {fully-convolutional unconditional UNet}. We show that the middle block of the UNet decomposes individual images into sparse subsets of active channels, and that the vector of spatial averages of these channels can provide a nonlinear representation of the underlying clean images. Euclidean distances in this representation space are semantically meaningful, even though no conditioning information is provided during training. We develop a novel algorithm for stochastic reconstruction of images conditioned on this representation: The synthesis using the unconditional model is "self-guided" by the representation extracted from that very same model. For a given representation, the common patterns in the set of reconstructed samples reveal the features captured in the middle block of the UNet. Together, these results show, for the first time, that a measure of semantic similarity emerges, unsupervised, solely from the denoising objective.

Abstract: Semantic retrieval is crucial for modern applications yet remains underexplored in current research. Existing datasets are limited to single languages, single images, or singular retrieval conditions, often failing to fully exploit the expressive capacity of visual information as evidenced by maintained performance when images are replaced with captions. However, practical retrieval scenarios frequently involve interleaved multi-condition queries with multiple images. Hence, this paper introduces MERIT, the first multilingual dataset for interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval, comprising 320,000 queries with 135,000 products in 5 languages, covering 7 distinct product categories. Extensive experiments on MERIT identify existing models's limitation: focusing solely on global semantic information while neglecting specific conditional elements in queries. Consequently, we propose Coral, a novel fine-tuning framework that adapts pre-trained MLLMs by integrating embedding reconstruction to preserve fine-grained conditional elements and contrastive learning to extract comprehensive global semantics. Experiments demonstrate that Coral achieves a 45.9% performance improvement over conventional approaches on MERIT, with strong generalization capabilities validated across 8 established retrieval benchmarks. Collectively, our contributions - a novel dataset, identification of critical limitations in existing approaches, and an innovative fine-tuning framework - establish a foundation for future research in interleaved multi-condition semantic retrieval.

Abstract: With the increasing awareness of health and the growing desire for aesthetic physique, fitness has become a prevailing trend. However, the potential risks associated with fitness training, especially with weight-loaded fitness actions, cannot be overlooked. Action Quality Assessment (AQA), a technology that quantifies the quality of human action and provides feedback, holds the potential to assist fitness enthusiasts of varying skill levels in achieving better training outcomes. Nevertheless, current AQA methodologies and datasets are limited to single-view competitive sports scenarios and RGB modality and lack professional assessment and guidance of fitness actions. To address this gap, we propose the FLEX dataset, the first multi-modal, multi-action, large-scale dataset that incorporates surface electromyography (sEMG) signals into AQA. FLEX utilizes high-precision MoCap to collect 20 different weight-loaded actions performed by 38 subjects across 3 different skill levels for 10 repetitions each, containing 5 different views of the RGB video, 3D pose, sEMG, and physiological information. Additionally, FLEX incorporates knowledge graphs into AQA, constructing annotation rules in the form of penalty functions that map weight-loaded actions, action keysteps, error types, and feedback. We conducted various baseline methodologies on FLEX, demonstrating that multimodal data, multiview data, and fine-grained annotations significantly enhance model performance. FLEX not only advances AQA methodologies and datasets towards multi-modal and multi-action scenarios but also fosters the integration of artificial intelligence within the fitness domain. Dataset and code are available at https://haoyin116.github.io/FLEX_Dataset.

Abstract: In recent years, the wide availability of high-resolution radar satellite images has enabled the remote monitoring of wetland surface areas. Machine learning models have achieved state-of-the-art results in segmenting wetlands from satellite images. However, these models require large amounts of manually annotated satellite images, which are slow and expensive to produce. The need for annotated training data makes it difficult to adapt these models to changes such as different climates or sensors. To address this issue, we employed self-supervised training methods to develop a model, AquaCluster, which segments radar satellite images into water and land areas without manual annotations. Our final model outperformed other radar-based water detection techniques that do not require annotated data in our test dataset, having achieved a 0.08 improvement in the Intersection over Union metric. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to train machine learning models to detect vegetated water from radar images without the use of annotated data, which can make the retraining of these models to account for changes much easier.

Abstract: Accurate road topology reasoning is critical for autonomous driving, enabling effective navigation and adherence to traffic regulations. Central to this task are lane perception and topology reasoning. However, existing methods typically focus on either lane detection or Lane-to-Lane (L2L) topology reasoning, often \textit{neglecting} Lane-to-Traffic-element (L2T) relationships or \textit{failing} to optimize these tasks jointly. Furthermore, most approaches either overlook relational modeling or apply it in a limited scope, despite the inherent spatial relationships among road elements. We argue that relational modeling is beneficial for both perception and reasoning, as humans naturally leverage contextual relationships for road element recognition and their connectivity inference. To this end, we introduce relational modeling into both perception and reasoning, \textit{jointly} enhancing structural understanding. Specifically, we propose: 1) a relation-aware lane detector, where our geometry-biased self-attention and \curve\ cross-attention refine lane representations by capturing relational dependencies; 2) relation-enhanced topology heads, including a geometry-enhanced L2L head and a cross-view L2T head, boosting reasoning with relational cues; and 3) a contrastive learning strategy with InfoNCE loss to regularize relationship embeddings. Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our approach significantly improves both detection and topology reasoning metrics, achieving +3.1 in DET$_l$, +5.3 in TOP$_{ll}$, +4.9 in TOP$_{lt}$, and an overall +4.4 in OLS, setting a new state-of-the-art. Code will be released.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary movements of the face that occur spontaneously when a person experiences an emotion but attempts to suppress or repress the facial expression, typically found in a high-stakes environment. In recent years, substantial advancements have been made in the areas of ME recognition, spotting, and generation. However, conventional approaches that treat spotting and recognition as separate tasks are suboptimal, particularly for analyzing long-duration videos in realistic settings. Concurrently, the emergence of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) offers promising new avenues for enhancing ME analysis through their powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities. The ME grand challenge (MEGC) 2025 introduces two tasks that reflect these evolving research directions: (1) ME spot-then-recognize (ME-STR), which integrates ME spotting and subsequent recognition in a unified sequential pipeline; and (2) ME visual question answering (ME-VQA), which explores ME understanding through visual question answering, leveraging MLLMs or LVLMs to address diverse question types related to MEs. All participating algorithms are required to run on this test set and submit their results on a leaderboard. More details are available at https://megc2025.github.io.

Abstract: Despite significant recent progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), current MLLMs are challenged by "spatio-temporal" prompts, i.e., prompts that refer to 1) the entirety of an environment encoded in a point cloud that the MLLM should consider; and simultaneously also refer to 2) actions that happened in part of the environment and are encoded in a short ego-centric video clip. However, such a holistic spatio-temporal understanding is important for agents operating in the real world. To address this challenge, we first develop a framework to collect a large-scale dataset. Using the collected "Reasoning about Environments and Actions" (REA) dataset, we show that recent MLLMs indeed struggle to correctly answer "spatio-temporal" prompts. Building on this dataset, we study two spatio-temporal LLM (STLLM) baselines: 1) STLLM-3D, which directly fuses point cloud, video, and text representations as inputs to the LLM; and 2) STLLM-Aligner, which aligns spatial context with video and text before LLM decoding. Both baselines aim to enhance spatial understanding of environments and temporal grounding of egocentric observations. On REA, the STLLM baselines outperform existing models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs. Code and data are available at https://zoezheng126.github.io/STLLM-website/.

Abstract: Enabling photorealistic avatar animations in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) has been challenging because of the difficulty of obtaining ground truth state of faces. It is physically impossible to obtain synchronized images from head-mounted cameras (HMC) sensing input, which has partial observations in infrared (IR), and an array of outside-in dome cameras, which have full observations that match avatars' appearance. Prior works relying on analysis-by-synthesis methods could generate accurate ground truth, but suffer from imperfect disentanglement between expression and style in their personalized training. The reliance of extensive paired captures (HMC and dome) for the same subject makes it operationally expensive to collect large-scale datasets, which cannot be reused for different HMC viewpoints and lighting. In this work, we propose a novel generative approach, Generative HMC (GenHMC), that leverages large unpaired HMC captures, which are much easier to collect, to directly generate high-quality synthetic HMC images given any conditioning avatar state from dome captures. We show that our method is able to properly disentangle the input conditioning signal that specifies facial expression and viewpoint, from facial appearance, leading to more accurate ground truth. Furthermore, our method can generalize to unseen identities, removing the reliance on the paired captures. We demonstrate these breakthroughs by both evaluating synthetic HMC images and universal face encoders trained from these new HMC-avatar correspondences, which achieve better data efficiency and state-of-the-art accuracy.

<title>Cross-modal Associations in Vision and Language Models: Revisiting the Bouba-Kiki Effect</title>

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have raised questions about whether vision-and-language models (VLMs) integrate cross-modal information in ways that reflect human cognition. One well-studied test case in this domain is the bouba-kiki effect, where humans reliably associate pseudowords like `bouba' with round shapes and `kiki' with jagged ones. Given the mixed evidence found in prior studies for this effect in VLMs, we present a comprehensive re-evaluation focused on two variants of CLIP, ResNet and Vision Transformer (ViT), given their centrality in many state-of-the-art VLMs. We apply two complementary methods closely modelled after human experiments: a prompt-based evaluation that uses probabilities as a measure of model preference, and we use Grad-CAM as a novel approach to interpret visual attention in shape-word matching tasks. Our findings show that these model variants do not consistently exhibit the bouba-kiki effect. While ResNet shows a preference for round shapes, overall performance across both model variants lacks the expected associations. Moreover, direct comparison with prior human data on the same task shows that the models' responses fall markedly short of the robust, modality-integrated behaviour characteristic of human cognition. These results contribute to the ongoing debate about the extent to which VLMs truly understand cross-modal concepts, highlighting limitations in their internal representations and alignment with human intuitions.

Abstract: We introduce a modular framework for predicting cancer-specific survival from whole slide pathology images (WSIs) that significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art accuracy. Our method integrating four key components. Firstly, to tackle large size of WSIs, we use dynamic patch selection via quantile-based thresholding for isolating prognostically informative tissue regions. Secondly, we use graph-guided k-means clustering to capture phenotype-level heterogeneity through spatial and morphological coherence. Thirdly, we use attention mechanisms that model both intra- and inter-cluster relationships to contextualize local features within global spatial relations between various types of tissue compartments. Finally, we use an expert-guided mixture density modeling for estimating complex survival distributions using Gaussian mixture models. The proposed model achieves a concordance index of $0.712 \pm 0.028$ and Brier score of $0.254 \pm 0.018$ on TCGA-KIRC (renal cancer), and a concordance index of $0.645 \pm 0.017$ and Brier score of $0.281 \pm 0.031$ on TCGA-LUAD (lung adenocarcinoma). These results are significantly better than the state-of-art and demonstrate predictive potential of the proposed method across diverse cancer types.

Abstract: Endoscopic depth estimation is a critical technology for improving the safety and precision of minimally invasive surgery. It has attracted considerable attention from researchers in medical imaging, computer vision, and robotics. Over the past decade, a large number of methods have been developed. Despite the existence of several related surveys, a comprehensive overview focusing on recent deep learning-based techniques is still limited. This paper endeavors to bridge this gap by systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art literature. Specifically, we provide a thorough survey of the field from three key perspectives: data, methods, and applications. Firstly, at the data level, we describe the acquisition process of publicly available datasets. Secondly, at the methodological level, we introduce both monocular and stereo deep learning-based approaches for endoscopic depth estimation. Thirdly, at the application level, we identify the specific challenges and corresponding solutions for the clinical implementation of depth estimation technology, situated within concrete clinical scenarios. Finally, we outline potential directions for future research, such as domain adaptation, real-time implementation, and the synergistic fusion of depth information with sensor technologies, thereby providing a valuable starting point for researchers to engage with and advance the field toward clinical translation.

Abstract: Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches: sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming, we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces three key innovations: (i) a trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; (ii) a noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later phases; and (iii) a seed group strategy that controls for initialization effects to isolate exploration contributions. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art performance in human preference alignment and text-to-image benchmarks.

Abstract: The increasing number of Health Care facilities in Nepal has added up the challenges on managing health care waste (HCW). Improper segregation and disposal of HCW leads to contamination, spreading of infectious diseases and risk for waste handlers. This study benchmarks the state of the art waste classification models: ResNeXt-50, EfficientNet-B0, MobileNetV3-S, YOLOv8-n and YOLOv5-s using stratified 5-fold cross-validation technique on combined HCW data. YOLOv5-s achieved the highest accuracy (95.06%) but fell short with the YOLOv8-n model in inference speed with few milliseconds. The EfficientNet-B0 showed promising results of 93.22% accuracy but took the highest inference time. Following a repetitive ANOVA test to confirm the statistical significance, the best performing model (YOLOv5-s) was deployed to the web with bin color mapped using Nepal's HCW management standards. Further work is suggested to address data limitation and ensure localized context.

Abstract: Symmetry is a fundamental concept that has been extensively studied, yet detecting it in complex scenes remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of symmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this work, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most common symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit geometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch architecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch specialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for its respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce orientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable orientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures similarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate axes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares patterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: Despite deep learning's broad success, its abstract-reasoning bottleneck persists. We tackle Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM), the benchmark for pattern, reasoning and problem-solving intelligence. We model the full causal chain image $\rightarrow$ attributes $\rightarrow$ progressive patterns $\rightarrow$ consistency $\rightarrow$ answer and build the baseline DIO. Yet DIO's mutual-information lower-bound objective does not embed human logic: the bound is loose and statistic-based, ignoring causal subject-object links. We therefore present three refinements. 1) Brando introduces trainable negative options to tighten the variational bound. 2) WORLD replaces generation with a Gaussian-mixture feature model that supplies infinite, weighted negatives, further tightening the bound. 3) DIEGO adds metadata supervision to rectify the "attributes $\rightarrow$ patterns" semantic gap, aligning representations with human rules. These upgrades substantially boost discriminative RPM accuracy and, for the first time, let DIO generate valid answers in open-ended RPM. The work provides causal-driven design guidelines, objective-refinement strategies and cross-modal insights for abstract-reasoning research.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability. First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts with superior scalability and robustness.

Abstract: Object hallucination in large vision-language models presents a significant challenge to their safe deployment in real-world applications. Recent works have proposed object-level hallucination scores to estimate the likelihood of object hallucination; however, these methods typically adopt either a global or local perspective in isolation, which may limit detection reliability. In this paper, we introduce GLSim, a novel training-free object hallucination detection framework that leverages complementary global and local embedding similarity signals between image and text modalities, enabling more accurate and reliable hallucination detection in diverse scenarios. We comprehensively benchmark existing object hallucination detection methods and demonstrate that GLSim achieves superior detection performance, outperforming competitive baselines by a significant margin.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of organs and tumors in CT and MRI scans is essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. While deep learning has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models (FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We introduce MedDINOv3, a simple and effective framework for adapting DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform domain-adaptive pretraining on CT-3M, a curated collection of 3.87M axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/ricklisz/MedDINOv3.

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing, recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations, frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and security.

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on ADNI with only 1,504 training MRIs, outperforming methods trained on 27,161 MRIs, and shows strong zero-shot generalization on OASIS-2 and AIBL. Code is available at https://github.com/CFQ666312/DEFT-VLM-AD.

Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model (VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.
  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder, Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date, ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection, the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the `craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history, including pre-training.

<title>CAGE: Continuity-Aware edGE Network Unlocks Robust Floorplan Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: We present CAGE (Continuity-Aware edGE) network, a robust framework for reconstructing vector floorplans directly from point-cloud density maps. Traditional corner-based polygon representations are highly sensitive to noise and incomplete observations, often resulting in fragmented or implausible layouts.Recent line grouping methods leverage structural cues to improve robustness but still struggle to recover fine geometric details. To address these limitations,we propose a native edge-centric formulation, modeling each wall segment as a directed, geometrically continuous edge. This representation enables inference of coherent floorplan structures, ensuring watertight, topologically valid room boundaries while improving robustness and reducing artifacts. Towards this design, we develop a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed and latent queries within a denoising framework, which not only stabilizes optimization but also accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments on Structured3D and SceneCAD show that CAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance, with F1 scores of 99.1% (rooms), 91.7% (corners), and 89.3% (angles). The method also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization, underscoring the efficacy of our architectural innovations. Code and pretrained models are available on our project page: https://github.com/ee-Liu/CAGE.git.

<title>Backdoor Mitigation via Invertible Pruning Masks</title>

Abstract: Model pruning has gained traction as a promising defense strategy against backdoor attacks in deep learning. However, existing pruning-based approaches often fall short in accurately identifying and removing the specific parameters responsible for inducing backdoor behaviors. Despite the dominance of fine-tuning-based defenses in recent literature, largely due to their superior performance, pruning remains a compelling alternative, offering greater interpretability and improved robustness in low-data regimes. In this paper, we propose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \emph{selection} mechanism to identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an \emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two complementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through the inverse mask. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem that jointly learns selection variables, a sparse invertible mask, and sample-specific backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. The inner problem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer problem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing clean-task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing pruning-based backdoor mitigation approaches, maintains strong performance under limited data conditions, and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Notably, the proposed approach is particularly effective in restoring correct predictions for compromised samples after successful backdoor mitigation.

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges, as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions, and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization, highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at: https://github.com/Geo-R1/geo-r1.

<title>On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations</title>

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0 demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing, and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations. Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four modalities.

<title>Diffusion-Classifier Synergy: Reward-Aligned Learning via Mutual Boosting Loop for FSCIL</title>

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation, their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation and editing technologies have enabled state-of-the-art models to achieve impressive results in general domains. However, when applied to e-commerce scenarios, these general models often encounter consistency limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce TBStar-Edit, an new image editing model tailored for the e-commerce domain. Through rigorous data engineering, model architecture design and training strategy, TBStar-Edit achieves precise and high-fidelity image editing while maintaining the integrity of product appearance and layout. Specifically, for data engineering, we establish a comprehensive data construction pipeline, encompassing data collection, construction, filtering, and augmentation, to acquire high-quality, instruction-following, and strongly consistent editing data to support model training. For model architecture design, we design a hierarchical model framework consisting of a base model, pattern shifting modules, and consistency enhancement modules. For model training, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the consistency preservation: first stage for editing pattern shifting, and second stage for consistency enhancement. Each stage involves training different modules with separate datasets. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of TBStar-Edit on a self-proposed e-commerce benchmark, and the results demonstrate that TBStar-Edit outperforms existing general-domain editing models in both objective metrics (VIE Score) and subjective user preference.

Abstract: The transferability of adversarial examples allows for the attack on unknown deep neural networks (DNNs), posing a serious threat to many applications and attracting great attention. In this paper, we improve the transferability of adversarial examples by incorporating the Bayesian formulation into both the model parameters and model input, enabling their joint diversification. We demonstrate that combination of Bayesian formulations for both the model input and model parameters yields significant improvements in transferability. By introducing advanced approximations of the posterior distribution over the model input, adversarial transferability achieves further enhancement, surpassing all state-of-the-arts when attacking without model fine-tuning. Additionally, we propose a principled approach to fine-tune model parameters within this Bayesian framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art in transfer-based attacks, significantly improving the average success rate on ImageNet and CIFAR-10.

Abstract: The rapid development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raises the question of how they compare to human performance. While existing datasets often feature synthetic or overly simplistic tasks, some models have already surpassed human expert baselines. In this paper, we present MULTI, a Chinese multimodal dataset derived from authentic examination questions. Comprising over 18,000 carefully selected and refined questions, MULTI evaluates models using real-world examination standards, encompassing image-text comprehension, complex reasoning, and knowledge recall. Additionally, We also introduce MULTI-Elite, a 500-question selected hard subset, and MULTI-Extend with more than 4,500 external knowledge context pieces for testing in-context learning capabilities. Our evaluation highlights substantial room for MLLM advancement, with Qwen2-VL-72B achieving a 76.9% accuracy on MULTI and 53.1% on MULTI-Elite leading 25 evaluated models, compared to human expert baselines of 86.1% and 73.1%. MULTI serves not only as a robust evaluation platform but also paves the way for the development of expert-level AI.

Abstract: The rapid growth of submissions to top-tier Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) conferences has prompted many venues to transition from closed to open review platforms. Some have fully embraced open peer reviews, allowing public visibility throughout the process, while others adopt hybrid approaches, such as releasing reviews only after final decisions or keeping reviews private despite using open peer review systems. In this work, we analyze the strengths and limitations of these models, highlighting the growing community interest in transparent peer review. To support this discussion, we examine insights from Paper Copilot, a website launched two years ago to aggregate and analyze AI / ML conference data while engaging a global audience. The site has attracted over 200,000 early-career researchers, particularly those aged 18-34 from 177 countries, many of whom are actively engaged in the peer review process. Drawing on our findings, this position paper advocates for a more transparent, open, and well-regulated peer review aiming to foster greater community involvement and propel advancements in the field.

Abstract: Traditional image compression methods aim to reconstruct images for human perception, prioritizing visual fidelity over task relevance. In contrast, Coding for Machines focuses on preserving information essential for automated understanding. Building on this principle, we present an end-to-end compression framework that retains text-specific features for Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The encoder operates at roughly half the computational cost of the OCR module, making it suitable for resource-limited devices. When on-device OCR is infeasible, images can be efficiently compressed and later decoded to recover textual content. Experiments show significant improvements in text extraction accuracy at low bitrates, even outperforming OCR on uncompressed images.
  We further extend this study to general-purpose encoders, exploring their capacity to preserve hidden semantics under extreme compression. Instead of optimizing for visual fidelity, we examine whether compact, visually degraded representations can retain recoverable meaning through learned enhancement and recognition modules. Results demonstrate that semantic information can persist despite severe compression, bridging text-oriented compression and general-purpose semantic preservation in machine-centered image coding.

Abstract: Robot vision has greatly benefited from advancements in multimodal fusion techniques and vision-language models (VLMs). We adopt a task-oriented perspective to systematically review the applications and advancements of multimodal fusion methods and VLMs in the field of robot vision. For semantic scene understanding tasks, we categorize fusion approaches into encoder-decoder frameworks, attention-based architectures, and graph neural networks. Meanwhile, we also analyze the architectural characteristics and practical implementations of these fusion strategies in key tasks such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), 3D object detection, navigation, and manipulation. We compare the evolutionary paths and applicability of VLMs based on large language models (LLMs) with traditional multimodal fusion methods.Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of commonly used datasets, evaluating their applicability and challenges in real-world robotic scenarios. Building on this analysis, we identify key challenges in current research, including cross-modal alignment, efficient fusion, real-time deployment, and domain adaptation. We propose future directions such as self-supervised learning for robust multimodal representations, structured spatial memory and environment modeling to enhance spatial intelligence, and the integration of adversarial robustness and human feedback mechanisms to enable ethically aligned system deployment. Through a comprehensive review, comparative analysis, and forward-looking discussion, we provide a valuable reference for advancing multimodal perception and interaction in robotic vision.

<title>PASE: Phoneme-Aware Speech Encoder to Improve Lip Sync Accuracy for Talking Head Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Recent talking head synthesis works typically adopt speech features extracted from large-scale pre-trained acoustic models. However, the intrinsic many-to-many relationship between speech and lip motion causes phoneme-viseme alignment ambiguity, leading to inaccurate and unstable lips. To further improve lip sync accuracy, we propose PASE (Phoneme-Aware Speech Encoder), a novel speech representation model that bridges the gap between phonemes and visemes. PASE explicitly introduces phoneme embeddings as alignment anchors and employs a contrastive alignment module to enhance the discriminability between corresponding audio-visual pairs. In addition, a prediction and reconstruction task is designed to improve robustness under noise and partial modality absence. Experimental results show PASE significantly improves lip sync accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance across both NeRF- and 3DGS-based rendering frameworks, outperforming conventional methods based on acoustic features by 13.7 % and 14.2 %, respectively. Importantly, PASE can be seamlessly integrated into diverse talking head pipelines to improve the lip sync accuracy without architectural modifications.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel in semantic tasks but falter at a core human capability: detecting hidden content in optical illusions or AI-generated images through perceptual adjustments like zooming. We introduce HC-Bench, a benchmark of 112 images with hidden text, objects, and illusions, revealing that leading VLMs achieve near-zero accuracy (0-5.36%)-even with explicit prompting. Humans resolve such ambiguities instinctively, yet VLMs fail due to an overreliance on high-level semantics. Strikingly, we propose SemVink (Semantic Visual Thinking) by simply scaling images to low resolutions (32-128 pixels), which unlocks >99% accuracy by eliminating redundant visual noise. This exposes a critical architectural flaw: VLMs prioritize abstract reasoning over low-level visual operations crucial for real-world robustness. Our work urges a shift toward hybrid models integrating multi-scale processing, bridging the gap between computational vision and human cognition for applications in medical imaging, security, and beyond.

Abstract: Many imaging modalities involve reconstruction of unknown objects from collections of noisy projections related by random rotations. In one of these modalities, cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) makes integration of information from multiple images crucial. Existing approaches to cryo-EM processing, however, either rely on handcrafted priors or apply deep learning only on select portions of the pipeline, such as particle picking, micrograph denoising, or refinement. A fully end-to-end reconstruction approach requires a neural network architecture that integrates information from multiple images while respecting the rotational symmetry of the measurement process. In this work, we introduce the polar transformer, a new neural network architecture that combines polar representations and transformers along with a convolutional attention mechanism that preserves the rotational symmetry of the problem. We apply it to the particle-level denoising problem, where it is able to learn discriminative features in the images, enabling optimal clustering, alignment, and denoising. On simulated datasets, this achieves up to a $2\times$ reduction in mean squared error (MSE) at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $0.02$, suggesting new opportunities for data-driven approaches to reconstruction in cryo-EM and related tomographic modalities.

Abstract: Orthogonal finetuning (OFT) offers highly parameter-efficient adaptation while preventing catastrophic forgetting, but its high runtime and memory demands limit practical deployment. We identify the core computational bottleneck in OFT as its weight-centric implementation, which relies on costly matrix-matrix multiplications with cubic complexity. To overcome this, we propose OFTv2, an input-centric reformulation that instead uses matrix-vector multiplications (i.e., matrix-free computation), reducing the computational cost to quadratic. We further introduce the Cayley-Neumann parameterization, an efficient orthogonal parameterization that approximates the matrix inversion in the Cayley transform via a truncated Neumann series. These modifications allow OFTv2 to achieve up to 10x faster training and 3x lower GPU memory usage without compromising performance. In addition, we extend OFTv2 to support finetuning quantized foundation models and show that it outperforms the popular QLoRA in training stability, efficiency, and memory usage.

Abstract: Dense audio-visual event localization (DAVE) aims to identify event categories and locate the temporal boundaries in untrimmed videos. Most studies only employ event-related semantic constraints on the final outputs, lacking cross-modal semantic bridging in intermediate layers. This causes modality semantic gap for further fusion, making it difficult to distinguish between event-related content and irrelevant background content. Moreover, they rarely consider the correlations between events, which limits the model to infer concurrent events among complex scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate multi-stage semantic guidance and multi-event relationship modeling, which respectively enable hierarchical semantic understanding of audio-visual events and adaptive extraction of event dependencies, thereby better focusing on event-related information. Specifically, our eventaware semantic guided network (ESG-Net) includes a early semantics interaction (ESI) module and a mixture of dependency experts (MoDE) module. ESI applys multi-stage semantic guidance to explicitly constrain the model in learning semantic information through multi-modal early fusion and several classification loss functions, ensuring hierarchical understanding of event-related content. MoDE promotes the extraction of multi-event dependencies through multiple serial mixture of experts with adaptive weight allocation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art methods, while greatly reducing parameters and computational load. Our code will be released on https://github.com/uchiha99999/ESG-Net.

Abstract: Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes. The source code and model weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/losehu/QuaDreamer.

Abstract: GUI agents powered by LLMs show promise in interacting with diverse digital environments. Among these, video games offer a valuable testbed due to their varied interfaces, with adventure games posing additional challenges through complex, narrative-driven interactions. Existing game benchmarks, however, lack diversity and rarely evaluate agents on completing entire storylines. To address this, we introduce FlashAdventure, a benchmark of 34 Flash-based adventure games designed to test full story arc completion and tackle the observation-behavior gap: the challenge of remembering and acting on earlier gameplay information. We also propose CUA-as-a-Judge, an automated gameplay evaluator, and COAST, an agentic framework leveraging long-term clue memory to better plan and solve sequential tasks. Experiments show current GUI agents struggle with full story arcs, while COAST improves milestone completion by bridging the observation-behavior gap. Nonetheless, a marked discrepancy between humans and best-performing agents warrants continued research efforts to narrow this divide.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have shown remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images from natural language descriptions. However, these models are highly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which can bypass safety measures and produce harmful content. Despite various defensive strategies, achieving robustness against attacks while maintaining practical utility in real-world applications remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we first conduct an empirical study of the text encoder in the Stable Diffusion (SD) model, which is a widely used and representative text-to-image model. Our findings reveal that the [EOS] token acts as a semantic aggregator, exhibiting distinct distributional patterns between benign and adversarial prompts in its embedding space. Building on this insight, we introduce SafeGuider, a two-step framework designed for robust safety control without compromising generation quality. SafeGuider combines an embedding-level recognition model with a safety-aware feature erasure beam search algorithm. This integration enables the framework to maintain high-quality image generation for benign prompts while ensuring robust defense against both in-domain and out-of-domain attacks. SafeGuider demonstrates exceptional effectiveness in minimizing attack success rates, achieving a maximum rate of only 5.48\% across various attack scenarios. Moreover, instead of refusing to generate or producing black images for unsafe prompts, SafeGuider generates safe and meaningful images, enhancing its practical utility. In addition, SafeGuider is not limited to the SD model and can be effectively applied to other text-to-image models, such as the Flux model, demonstrating its versatility and adaptability across different architectures. We hope that SafeGuider can shed some light on the practical deployment of secure text-to-image systems.

Summary:
This paper introduces a method to enhance the quality of 3D lunar maps generated from Kaguya TC images. The focus is on addressing the altitude inaccuracies and noise caused by compression artifacts in the imagery. By analyzing the compression behavior of Kaguya TC images, the study identifies systematic disparity noise patterns, particularly in darker regions. The proposed approach aims to reduce residual noise in disparity images derived from compressed photos, improving the accuracy of elevation data for lunar missions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in reducing elevation noise and ensuring the safety and reliability of terrain information for future endeavors such as NASA's Endurance mission concept. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

Summary:
Pre-training CLIP and DINO under controlled settings with the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration resulted in similar ImageNet accuracy. Analysis of embeddings showed that CLIP captures high-level semantics while DINO is more responsive to low-level features. When integrated into vision-language models and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excelled at text-intensive tasks while DINO performed slightly better on vision-centric tasks. Different variants of language supervision did not yield significant gains. This study provides insight into the design of vision encoders and their impact on vision-language model performance. <div>

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings -- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration -- achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder design and its impact on VLM performance.

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2, placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy while maintaining captioning quality.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages: First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and 91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets, respectively.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter, occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of 73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial environments.

Summary: 
Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown excellent performance in medical imaging tasks, but their complex attention mechanisms make it challenging to explain model decisions. This study compared different ViT architectures and pre-training strategies using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM on tasks like peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image classification. The research found that DINO combined with Grad-CAM provided the most faithful and localized explanations. Grad-CAM consistently produced precise heatmaps, while Gradient Attention Rollout had more scattered activations.

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks: peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps, while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

Summary: 
The article presents a novel approach, APGNet, for detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments, addressing challenges of image degradation and natural camouflage. By incorporating the Multi-Scale Retinex with Color Restoration algorithm for data augmentation, APGNet mitigates degradation effects. The use of an Extended Receptive Field module and Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder aids in capturing multi-scale contextual information and refining feature representations. Additionally, the adaptive prior-guided mechanism combines position and boundary priors to enhance detection accuracy. Experimental results on MAS datasets show that APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods in camouflaged object detection. <div>

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms. Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network, which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation, generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects. Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely used evaluation metrics.

Summary:
VidMP3 is a novel approach that addresses the challenges of motion-preserved video editing by leveraging pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion representation. Traditional diffusion-based editing methods focus on structure preservation, but VidMP3 goes beyond that by enabling structural and semantic flexibility while maintaining the original motion of source videos. This approach overcomes issues like temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for human intervention. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations have shown the superiority of VidMP3 over existing methods. The code for VidMP3 will be publicly available on GitHub, ensuring accessibility and further development in the field of motion-preserved video editing. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored. Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks, using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

Summary:
Domain Adaptation is a crucial method in computer vision, particularly in image classification, where labeled data is often scarce or expensive to obtain. This paper explores various strategies to implement Domain Adaptation, focusing on using a model trained on one dataset to make predictions on data from a different but related domain. By leveraging the knowledge gained from the trained model, such as paintings of airplanes, to predict on real images of airplanes, researchers can address the challenges posed by limited labeled data. Domain Adaptation offers a solution to the high cost and difficulty of obtaining labeled data, allowing for the generation of reliable results comparable to established benchmark performances. Through implementing Domain Adaptation techniques, computer vision researchers can improve the efficiency and accuracy of image classification tasks, even in the face of data scarcity.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new approach for QR code deblurring, focusing on successful decoding rather than perceptual quality. The Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB) is proposed to incorporate explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture, leading to the development of the Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer) network for severely blurred QR codes and the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for mildly blurred inputs. These networks are integrated into the Adaptive Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the appropriate network based on input blur severity, making it suitable for resource-constrained mobile devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve superior performance with competitive speed, positioning them as state-of-the-art solutions in QR code deblurring. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration. Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.

<div> geometry, 3D scene reconstruction, generative models, depth maps, scene completion

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel method that addresses limitations in existing 3D scene reconstruction techniques by leveraging accurate geometry guidance. By utilizing planar structures to derive metric-scale depth maps, the proposed method enhances visibility mask estimation, guides novel view selection, and improves multi-view consistency. This approach leads to high-quality reconstructions in both observed and unobserved regions, reducing shape-appearance ambiguities and enhancing scene geometry. The method outperforms existing techniques on datasets like Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending, showing superior performance in geometry and appearance reconstruction, especially for unobserved areas. Additionally, the method supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, demonstrating strong generalizability in various indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world applicability. Overall, the proposed method significantly advances 3D scene reconstruction by integrating accurate geometry as a fundamental component in leveraging generative models.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision, they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions, let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion. Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world applicability.

Summary:
The article introduces the Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to tackle challenges in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning (CIL). The framework includes the Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA) network, which adds a lightweight adapter in each incremental stage to smooth representation shift. The Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS) ensures consistency in feature representations across stages by comparing positive and negative samples with a virtual anchor. Experimental results on six benchmarks demonstrate DRL's superiority over other methods in CIL, maintaining high efficiency in training and inference phases.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs), remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA) network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference phases.

<div> face restoration, old photos, diffusion-guided methods, self-supervised selective-guided diffusion, VintageFace benchmark

Summary:
The article introduces a new method, SSDiff, for restoring faces in old photos, addressing challenges such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. SSDiff leverages pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak guidance to enable region-specific restoration. The method incorporates face parsing maps and scratch masks for selective restoration of breakage regions while avoiding identity mismatch. It uses staged supervision for structural guidance and color refinement, aligning with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. The researchers also introduce VintageFace, a benchmark dataset of 300 real old face photos with varying degradation levels. SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. The code for SSDiff is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a 300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels. SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link: https://github.com/PRIS-CV/SSDiff.

Summary: <br />
- A new framework called ImageSentinel is introduced to protect visual datasets in Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) systems.
- The framework creates sentinel images that are visually consistent with the original dataset and can be used for protection verification via randomly generated character sequences.

arXiv:2510.12119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation quality for authorized applications.

<div> Single-photon cameras, compressive histograms, optimization, coding functions, hardware constraints<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Single-photon cameras are commonly used in time-of-flight 3D imaging due to their high resolution photon time-tagging capability. However, hardware limitations can affect their performance. Compressive histograms were introduced as a solution for data rate challenges, but they can struggle under real-world illumination constraints. A constrained optimization approach for designing coding functions for compressive single-photon 3D imaging is proposed in this study. By optimizing an illumination and coding matrix using gradient descent, the approach adheres to hardware constraints and outperforms traditional coding designs. This is particularly evident in systems constrained by peak power. The approach also handles arbitrary parameterized impulse responses well, as demonstrated in evaluation with a real-world system. <div>
arXiv:2510.12123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution. However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Summary: 
CapFlow is introduced as a new approach to generalist visual captioning, aiming to bridge the gap between open-source models and commercial ones. By leveraging the collaboration of multiple agents, CapFlow achieves caption quality comparable to GPT-4.1 while reducing costs by 89.5%. Through data synthesis, CapFlow generates high-quality visual captions across various domains, leading to the development of MetaCaptioner, a generalist visual captioner achieved through fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaCaptioner not only matches commercial models in captioning capabilities but also excels in multimodal performance within the open-source community. This innovative approach is expected to advance future multimodal research by providing a robust and cost-effective solution for visual captioning tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5% reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and cost-effective visual captioning solution.

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work. Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous \textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

<div> Keywords: Continual Test-Time Adaptation, Knowledge Fusion and Fission, Domain Knowledge, Streaming Data, ImageNet-C dataset
Summary: <br /><br />Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to fine-tune models during the test phase for adapting to various unknown downstream domain distributions without pre-acquiring data. Existing CTTA methods struggle with forgetting historical knowledge, leading to insufficient learning of new information and performance degradation. To address this, the proposed Knowledge Fusion and Fission (KFF) method dynamically expands and merges class-aware domain knowledge in old and new domains. The Domain Knowledge Fission (KFI) module separates new knowledge from historical data, reducing negative impacts. The Domain Knowledge Fusion (KFU) module merges fissioned knowledge efficiently to improve compatibility and computational efficiency. Experimental results on the ImageNet-C dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against other methods. <div>
arXiv:2510.12150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end, existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge, resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool, alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed method against other methods.

Summary: 
Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL) is introduced as a framework for one-shot medical image segmentation, addressing challenges in prototype representation. DPL models prototypes as learnable probability distributions, allowing for the generation of diverse yet coherent variant sets from limited labeled data. The framework incorporates a diffusion-based prototype enhancement module, a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism, and a conservative fusion strategy to enhance prototype representation. Training and inference consistency is ensured through the use of the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline. Through extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets, DPL demonstrates significant performance improvements, establishing new state-of-the-art results in one-shot medical image segmentation. DPL's diffusion process acts as a regularizer while generating enhanced prototypes for similarity calculations, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed framework. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization. This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics, and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

<div> pre-trained state space models, video classification, prompt learning, spatial contextual information, temporal contextual information <br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces a new method called State Space Prompting (SSP) for video understanding. SSP combines intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key spatiotemporal information in videos efficiently. It addresses the limitations of sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens in capturing spatial and temporal contextual information, enhancing the propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal information between frames. The proposed SSP method consists of an Intra-Frame Gathering (IFG) module to aggregate spatial key information within each frame and an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module to spread discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. Through adaptive balancing and compression of key spatio-temporal information within and between frames, SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in videos, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 2.76% on four video benchmark datasets while reducing the parameter fine-tuning overhead. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering (IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by 2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images, geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers, enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

The teacher model generates pseudo-masks updated by the student model via Exponential Moving Average. Instance center-based query refinement improves position query localization.

arXiv:2510.12182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage. However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining computationally efficient.

Summary:
CompoDistill introduces a novel knowledge distillation framework aimed at improving the visual perception abilities of smaller models by aligning their visual attention with that of larger models, addressing the limitations of existing methods. Through systematic analysis, the misalignment of visual attention between teacher and student models was identified as a key challenge, which CompoDistill effectively tackles. The framework significantly enhances performance on compositional reasoning tasks reliant on visual perception while maintaining strong results on visual question answering tasks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CompoDistill, even with more advanced model architectures, demonstrating its generalizability. The framework's focus on aligning visual attention highlights its innovative approach to improving multimodal large language models through knowledge distillation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity, making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative, which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model (teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in existing studies.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies, and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models (VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic events. The implementation and code are available at https://github.com/riron1206/kaggle-2COOOL-2nd-Place-Solution.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models. Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning, which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only, specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios. It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting, utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection models.

Summary: <br />
- Micro-expressions are brief facial movements that reveal genuine emotions and are crucial for applications in psychology and security.
- Recognizing micro-expressions is challenging due to their subtle and transient nature and limited annotated data availability.
- Conventional dynamic image-based methods for micro-expression recognition often overlook the distinct temporal phases within a micro-expression.
- The proposed DIANet framework leverages phase-aware dynamic images to capture the onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset phases separately and integrates features using a cross-attention fusion module.
- Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DIANet outperforms conventional methods by explicitly modeling temporal phase information. 

<br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network, and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a promising direction for advancing MER.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c) scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes. For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse. Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

<div> Efficiency, image generation, multi-token prediction, self-correcting, quality improvement <br />
<br />
Efficiency in image and video generation is crucial, with a focus on reducing inference time and improving model size. A novel approach combines auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction to achieve up to a tenfold decrease in inference time. However, predicting multiple tokens in parallel can lead to structural inconsistencies due to complex joint dependencies. To address this issue, a method for self-correcting image generation is proposed, allowing for iterative refinement of sampled tokens. By injecting random tokens in the context during training, robustness is improved, and errors in predictions can be fixed during sampling. Evaluation on ImageNet-256, CIFAR-10, UCF-101, and NuScenes datasets shows significant improvements in image and video generation quality, maintaining the time-saving benefits of parallel token prediction. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step, reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements across both modalities.

Summary: 
In the field of drone-based multi-modality sensing, addressing the challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) is crucial. The proposed Ivan-ISTD framework tackles these challenges through a two-stage approach.

The Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark dataset is introduced to simulate distribution shifts in real-world applications, demonstrating the versatility of the approach. Experimental results show superior performance compared to existing methods, particularly showcasing robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for the framework is available for access.

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling. Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at: https://github.com/nanjin1/Ivan-ISTD.

<div> Keywords: video representation, proxy nodes, spatio-temporal consistency, appearance editing, video processing<br />
Summary:<br />
The article proposes a novel approach to video representation using spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes. These nodes offer stable multi-scale structure representation of visual objects, resistant to tracking errors, motion, occlusion, and viewpoint changes. The dynamic update mechanism of the proxy nodes leverages spatio-temporal priors to handle scene and object changes effectively. Furthermore, the decoupled encoding of shape and texture representations enables fine-grained appearance editing across different visual objects in the video. Experimental results demonstrate high video reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters, supporting video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally consistent video editing tasks.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.12256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability, this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand, the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally consistent video editing.

Summary:
The article introduces two new loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, designed for semantic segmentation in medical and cellular images. Traditional loss functions like Cross Entropy and Dice Loss may not perform optimally with limited data in medical imaging due to data scarcity. The Multiplicative Loss combines these two losses multiplicatively, adjusting gradients based on prediction confidence to stabilize optimization. The Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss further enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by scaling gradients based on confidence levels and predicted probabilities. Experimental results on cellular and medical segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms existing loss functions, providing a simple and effective solution for robust segmentation in challenging data environments without the need for hyperparameter tuning. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used, their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples. This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

Summary:
The study introduces a novel OOD detection method for neural networks to address the challenge of overconfident predictions on OOD data. It leverages local background features from ID images to simulate OOD representations during training. By optimizing to reduce the $L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks can mitigate the overconfidence issue when faced with OOD data. The method proves effective in multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks, showcasing improved performance compared to existing methods. It demonstrates compatibility with post-hoc techniques and achieves new state-of-the-art results in OOD detection. The approach offers a cost-effective solution without the need for auxiliary OOD datasets or generated fake OOD images. <div>
arXiv:2510.12259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the $L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods, with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

Visible-infrared image fusion is essential for applications like autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Existing unsupervised methods face challenges due to limitations in manual loss functions. To address this, a new approach called AngularFuse is proposed. It includes a cross-modal mask module for learning complementary information, a strategy for generating detailed and balanced reference images, and an angle-aware loss for preserving texture intensity and edge orientation. Experiments on public datasets show AngularFuse outperforms existing methods, producing sharper and more detailed fusion results in challenging scenes. <div>

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness. On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain. AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating superior fusion capability.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images, covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format. SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost. This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects, while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to over 350 FPS.

<div> Keywords: Video Retrieval, Partially Relevant, Dual Learning, Knowledge Distillation, Soft Targets

Summary:
In this paper, the authors address the challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR), where untrimmed videos with complex background content need to be retrieved based on a given query. They propose a novel framework called DL-DKD++ which utilizes a dual learning approach with dynamic knowledge distillation. The framework consists of a large teacher model that supervises a compact student network with two branches: an inheritance branch for transferable knowledge and an exploration branch for task-specific information. By incorporating a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism, the model can capture fine-grained partial relevance between videos and queries better. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods on various datasets for PRVR. The code for the model is also made available for further research and implementation. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content. However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve during training, our method enables the model to better capture the fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR.

<div> hallucination, logos, VLMs, perturbations, OCR<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper examines logo hallucination in Vision Language Models (VLMs) where models generate text despite logos lacking visible words. The study uses curated logo splits and perturbations to measure hallucinations, finding they persist even under strong distortions. Analysis shows hallucination is tied to specific projector dimensions, with targeted ablation reducing errors while maintaining OCR accuracy. VLMs rely on symbolic priors rather than genuine glyph perception, especially for circular logos. The study highlights the importance of disentangling projector subspaces and using OCR-guided decoding to build more reliable multimodal systems. <div>

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode. Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place overall.

<br />
Summary: <br />
The article introduces CurriFlow, a framework for semantic scene completion from monocular images in autonomous driving applications. CurriFlow integrates optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion to improve motion reasoning and handle occlusions. It utilizes a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual, and depth features across frames, enhancing temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. The framework employs curriculum learning to transition from sparse but accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during training, ensuring geometric robustness. Semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide category-agnostic supervision for improved semantic learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean IoU of 16.9, showcasing its effectiveness for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion. <div>

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion. CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual, and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

Summary: 
- A novel learnable subsampling framework is proposed for deep neural networks to reduce computational complexity in tasks like 3D volume or video classification.
- Existing methods using the Gumbel-max trick for non-differentiable operations are limited in adaptability, as they are task-adaptive rather than input-adaptive.
- The proposed attention-guided sampling module dynamically adjusts to input data during inference, leading to improved performance and reduced complexity.
- The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D and two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks.
- One of the ultrasound video datasets is a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical conditions. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.12376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance, these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks, not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive. Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical conditions.

<div> Detection, Procedure step recognition, Occlusion-resilient modeling, Spatio-temporal features, Dual-stream framework<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces STORM-PSR, a dual-stream framework for Procedure Step Recognition (PSR) that combines spatial and temporal features. The spatial stream detects assembly object states in unobstructed views, while the spatio-temporal stream recognizes step completions even under partial occlusion. STORM-PSR utilizes a spatial encoder pretrained with a weakly supervised approach and a transformer-based temporal encoder to capture spatial and temporal relationships. Evaluation on MECCANO and IndustReal datasets shows a significant reduction in delay between actual and predicted step completions compared to prior methods. This reduction is attributed to the spatio-temporal stream's ability to infer step completions without relying on unobstructed views. The code for STORM-PSR and newly annotated MECCANO labels are publicly available for further research. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.12385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object, while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%, respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

<div> Scene coordinate regression, implicit scene representations, probabilistic reinterpretation, reconstruction priors, 3D point cloud diffusion model <br />
Summary: 
Scene coordinate regression models are effective for 3D vision tasks but may degenerate if training images lack multi-view constraints. A probabilistic reinterpretation with high-level reconstruction priors, including depth value distribution and learned scene coordinate configurations, enhances the learning process. By training a diffusion model on indoor scans, predicted 3D points are guided towards realistic geometry, improving scene representations, point cloud coherence, registration rates, camera poses, and performance in tasks like view synthesis and camera relocalization. <div>
arXiv:2510.12387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models, which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations, resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs, vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved. Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation. This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021 and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3) What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

<div> conditional flow matching, image quality transfer, low-field magnetic resonance imaging, MRI reconstruction, deep learning

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel framework called conditional flow matching (CFM) for image quality transfer, specifically focusing on low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI). CFM learns a continuous flow between noise and target data distributions by directly regressing an optimal velocity field, which allows for reconstruction of high-quality MR images from low-field inputs. The framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and generalizes well to various data types, including out-of-distribution data. It achieves this while using fewer parameters compared to other deep learning methods, making it a promising tool for MRI reconstruction in resource-limited clinical settings. <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods. These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

Summary:<br /><br />Agent-based systems using large language models for long video understanding face challenges in capturing temporal context and discarding crucial information due to sparse frame sampling. To address these issues, VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework, is proposed. Inspired by human recollection, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with progressive granularity to systematically mine deep memories for answering questions in long videos. By iterating through the memory levels, VideoLucy effectively captures temporal context while preserving critical details. Additionally, a new benchmark, EgoMem, is introduced for evaluating models' ability to understand complex events over time in long videos. Extensive experiments show VideoLucy outperforming state-of-the-art methods, even surpassing proprietary models like GPT-4o. The code and dataset for VideoLucy will be publicly available at https://videolucy.github.io. <div>
arXiv:2510.12422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding. EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks, achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as GPT-4o.

This article discusses the use of vision language models for automating Chest Xray radiology report generation to reduce manual workload.

The survey examines dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures tailored for longitudinal settings, and evaluation protocols.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches, however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements. Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a foundation for advancing this emerging field.

Summary:
MS-GAGA is a two-stage framework for crafting imperceptible and transferable adversarial examples targeted at deepfake detectors in black-box scenarios. In Stage 1, the dual-stream attack module uses MNTD-PGD to optimize gradient calculations for small perturbations and SG-PGD to focus perturbations on visually salient regions, expanding the search space for adversarial examples. In Stage 2, the metric-aware selection module evaluates candidates based on their success against black-box models and structural similarity to the original image, achieving up to 27% higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to existing attacks. By jointly optimizing for transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA demonstrates improved performance in circumventing deepfake detectors.

This complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image.

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data, especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation. However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions. Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority over the state of the arts.

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD), for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF. Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces, as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining computationally efficient and stable.

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2 score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in isolation.

<title>CoIRL-AD: Collaborative-Competitive Imitation-Reinforcement Learning in Latent World Models for Autonomous Driving</title>

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning (IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines, along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail scenarios.

<title>MMOT: The First Challenging Benchmark for Drone-based Multispectral Multi-Object Tracking</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12565</link>

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability. Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii) Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and (iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at https://github.com/Annzstbl/MMOT.

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over state-of-the-art approaches.

arXiv:2510.12579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural scenarios.

<title>LayerSync: Self-aligning Intermediate Layers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.12581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient, plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at https://github.com/vita-epfl/LayerSync.

arXiv:2510.12586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75 number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step, significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or diffusion models.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information, enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text. Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR), which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase of over 5 times compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges, including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset, WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

<title>Zero-Shot CFC: Fast Real-World Image Denoising based on Cross-Frequency Consistency</title>

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless, existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically, image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of computational efficiency and denoising performance.

<title>On the Use of Hierarchical Vision Foundation Models for Low-Cost Human Mesh Recovery and Pose Estimation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.12660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE). State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large, non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27 hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models. Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight alternatives.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission. Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model weights will be released under a permissive license.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations: bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

<title>EReLiFM: Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning for Open-Set Domain Generalization under Noisy Labels</title>

arXiv:2510.12687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL) using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals, enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The source code is available at https://github.com/KPeng9510/ERELIFM.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization. While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally, it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

<title>Beyond Seeing: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs on Tool-Enabled Image Perception, Transformation, and Reasoning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.12712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored. Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS, an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model (GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare. However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients' privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals, clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive against current federated fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408 videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity, and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis. Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in 3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision (e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even with supervised approaches.

<title>PET Head Motion Estimation Using Supervised Deep Learning with Attention</title>

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention (DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data. DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG, 18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5 plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings.

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training. Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

<title>Uncertainty Matters in Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Monocular 4D Reconstruction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12768</link>

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation, vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation. Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT. Code and models are publicly available at https://compvis.github.io/flow-poke-transformer.

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts. This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward} ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a \textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82 to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation via self-rewarding.

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film, virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming, requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here, we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model, MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to 360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of generated avatars compared to previous methods.

Abstract: This paper reviews the AIM 2025 Efficient Real-World Deblurring using Single Images Challenge, which aims to advance in efficient real-blur restoration. The challenge is based on a new test set based on the well known RSBlur dataset. Pairs of blur and degraded images in this dataset are captured using a double-camera system. Participant were tasked with developing solutions to effectively deblur these type of images while fulfilling strict efficiency constraints: fewer than 5 million model parameters and a computational budget under 200 GMACs. A total of 71 participants registered, with 4 teams finally submitting valid solutions. The top-performing approach achieved a PSNR of 31.1298 dB, showcasing the potential of efficient methods in this domain. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the challenge, compares the proposed solutions, and serves as a valuable reference for researchers in efficient real-world image deblurring.

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text. This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI), which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

<title>ViCO: A Training Strategy towards Semantic Aware Dynamic High-Resolution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.12793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs. In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch. Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning, and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future research.

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes. Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured image analysis.

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However, VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose \textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment. We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a 680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size increases.

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a 3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring, pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual perception systems.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic and ever-changing real-world information in order to address information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches, such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1, the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools. Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

Abstract: We introduce SeeingSounds, a lightweight and modular framework for audio-to-image generation that leverages the interplay between audio, language, and vision-without requiring any paired audio-visual data or training on visual generative models. Rather than treating audio as a substitute for text or relying solely on audio-to-text mappings, our method performs dual alignment: audio is projected into a semantic language space via a frozen language encoder, and, contextually grounded into the visual domain using a vision-language model. This approach, inspired by cognitive neuroscience, reflects the natural cross-modal associations observed in human perception. The model operates on frozen diffusion backbones and trains only lightweight adapters, enabling efficient and scalable learning. Moreover, it supports fine-grained and interpretable control through procedural text prompt generation, where audio transformations (e.g., volume or pitch shifts) translate into descriptive prompts (e.g., "a distant thunder") that guide visual outputs. Extensive experiments across standard benchmarks confirm that SeeingSounds outperforms existing methods in both zero-shot and supervised settings, establishing a new state of the art in controllable audio-to-visual generation.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Embodied Navigation aims to enable agents to autonomously navigate to sound sources in unknown 3D environments using auditory cues. While current AVN methods excel on in-distribution sound sources, they exhibit poor cross-source generalization: navigation success rates plummet and search paths become excessively long when agents encounter unheard sounds or unseen environments. This limitation stems from the lack of explicit alignment mechanisms between auditory signals and corresponding visual regions. Policies tend to memorize spurious \enquote{acoustic fingerprint-scenario} correlations during training, leading to blind exploration when exposed to novel sound sources. To address this, we propose the AGVP framework, which transforms sound from policy-memorable acoustic fingerprint cues into spatial guidance. The framework first extracts global auditory context via audio self-attention, then uses this context as queries to guide visual feature attention, highlighting sound-source-related regions at the feature level. Subsequent temporal modeling and policy optimization are then performed. This design, centered on interpretable cross-modal alignment and region reweighting, reduces dependency on specific acoustic fingerprints. Experimental results demonstrate that AGVP improves both navigation efficiency and robustness while achieving superior cross-scenario generalization on previously unheard sounds.

Abstract: As the demand for immersive 3D content grows, the need for intuitive and efficient interaction methods becomes paramount. Current techniques for physically manipulating 3D content within Virtual Reality (VR) often face significant limitations, including reliance on engineering-intensive processes and simplified geometric representations, such as tetrahedral cages, which can compromise visual fidelity and physical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce \our{} (\textbf{G}aussian \textbf{S}platting for \textbf{V}irtual \textbf{E}nvironment \textbf{R}endering and \textbf{S}cene \textbf{E}diting), a novel method designed to overcome these challenges by directly integrating an object's mesh with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation. Our approach enables more precise surface approximation, leading to highly realistic deformations and interactions. By leveraging existing 3D mesh assets, \our{} facilitates seamless content reuse and simplifies the development workflow. Moreover, our system is designed to be physics-engine-agnostic, granting developers robust deployment flexibility. This versatile architecture delivers a highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D manipulation. We rigorously validate our method against the current state-of-the-art technique that couples VR with GS in a comparative user study involving 18 participants. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach is statistically significantly better for physics-aware stretching manipulation and is also more consistent in other physics-based manipulations like twisting and shaking. Further evaluation across various interactions and scenes confirms that our method consistently delivers high and reliable performance, showing its potential as a plausible alternative to existing methods.

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy. This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process. Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion acceleration.

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning tasks.

<title>Gaussian Semantic Field for One-shot LiDAR Global Localization</title>

Abstract: We present a one-shot LiDAR global localization algorithm featuring semantic disambiguation ability based on a lightweight tri-layered scene graph. While landmark semantic registration-based methods have shown promising performance improvements in global localization compared with geometric-only methods, landmarks can be repetitive and misleading for correspondence establishment. We propose to mitigate this problem by modeling semantic distributions with continuous functions learned from a population of Gaussian processes. Compared with discrete semantic labels, the continuous functions capture finer-grained geo-semantic information and also provide more detailed metric information for correspondence establishment. We insert this continuous function as the middle layer between the object layer and the metric-semantic layer, forming a tri-layered 3D scene graph, serving as a light-weight yet performant backend for one-shot localization. We term our global localization pipeline Outram-GSF (Gaussian semantic field) and conduct a wide range of experiments on publicly available data sets, validating the superior performance against the current state-of-the-art.

<title>MAPS: Masked Attribution-based Probing of Strategies- A computational framework to align human and model explanations</title>

Abstract: Human core object recognition depends on the selective use of visual information, but the strategies guiding these choices are difficult to measure directly. We present MAPS (Masked Attribution-based Probing of Strategies), a behaviorally validated computational tool that tests whether explanations derived from artificial neural networks (ANNs) can also explain human vision. MAPS converts attribution maps into explanation-masked images (EMIs) and compares image-by-image human accuracies on these minimal images with limited pixel budgets with accuracies on the full stimuli. MAPS provides a principled way to evaluate and choose among competing ANN interpretability methods. In silico, EMI-based behavioral similarity between models reliably recovers the ground-truth similarity computed from their attribution maps, establishing which explanation methods best capture the model's strategy. When applied to humans and macaques, MAPS identifies ANN-explanation combinations whose explanations align most closely with biological vision, achieving the behavioral validity of Bubble masks while requiring far fewer behavioral trials. Because it needs only access to model attributions and a modest set of behavioral data on the original images, MAPS avoids exhaustive psychophysics while offering a scalable tool for adjudicating explanations and linking human behavior, neural activity, and model decisions under a common standard.

<title>Tensor Completion via Monotone Inclusion: Generalized Low-Rank Priors Meet Deep Denoisers</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12425</link>

arXiv:2510.12425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Missing entries in multi dimensional data pose significant challenges for downstream analysis across diverse real world applications. These data are naturally modeled as tensors, and recent completion methods integrating global low rank priors with plug and play denoisers have demonstrated strong empirical performance. However, these approaches often rely on empirical convergence alone or unrealistic assumptions, such as deep denoisers acting as proximal operators of implicit regularizers, which generally does not hold. To address these limitations, we propose a novel tensor completion framework grounded in the monotone inclusion paradigm, which unifies generalized low rank priors with deep pseudo contractive denoisers and extends beyond traditional convex optimization. Building on the Davis Yin splitting scheme, we develop the GTCTV DPC algorithm and rigorously establish its global convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTCTV DPC consistently outperforms existing methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly at low sampling rates.

<title>A Function Centric Perspective On Flat and Sharp Minima</title>

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation), calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

Abstract: We present a fast and effective policy framework for robotic manipulation, named Energy Policy, designed for high-frequency robotic tasks and resource-constrained systems. Unlike existing robotic policies, Energy Policy natively predicts multimodal actions in a single forward pass, enabling high-precision manipulation at high speed. The framework is built upon two core components. First, we adopt the energy score as the learning objective to facilitate multimodal action modeling. Second, we introduce an energy MLP to implement the proposed objective while keeping the architecture simple and efficient. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both simulated environments and real-world robotic tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of Energy Policy. The results show that Energy Policy matches or surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art manipulation methods while significantly reducing computational overhead. Notably, on the MimicGen benchmark, Energy Policy achieves superior performance with at a faster inference compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) learn conceptual representations, in the form of generalized knowledge, during training, they are typically used to analyze individual instances. When evaluation instances are atypical, this paradigm results in tension between two priors in the model. The first is a pragmatic prior that the textual and visual input are both relevant, arising from VLM finetuning on congruent inputs; the second is a semantic prior that the conceptual representation is generally true for instances of the category. In order to understand how VLMs trade off these priors, we introduce a new evaluation dataset, VISaGE, consisting of both typical and exceptional images. In carefully balanced experiments, we show that conceptual understanding degrades when the assumption of congruency underlying the pragmatic prior is violated with incongruent images. This effect is stronger than the effect of the semantic prior when querying about individual instances.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM) from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models aim to yield informative unified representations that empower diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite promising developments in the evolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language models, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world applications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support, unstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we introduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that addresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural design. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme to boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning. Specifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the model's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched cross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement training further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios by distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while mining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic specialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training flexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding achieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval tasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated with our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a crucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model delivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.158% and the 14-day LT gain of +0.144% in the Douyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features produced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.08% AUC gain.

Abstract: Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective, we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable, efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such detailed captions.

Abstract: Incorporating heterogeneous representations from different architectures has facilitated various vision tasks, e.g., some hybrid networks combine transformers and convolutions. However, complementarity between such heterogeneous architectures has not been well exploited in self-supervised learning. Thus, we propose Heterogeneous Self-Supervised Learning (HSSL), which enforces a base model to learn from an auxiliary head whose architecture is heterogeneous from the base model. In this process, HSSL endows the base model with new characteristics in a representation learning way without structural changes. To comprehensively understand the HSSL, we conduct experiments on various heterogeneous pairs containing a base model and an auxiliary head. We discover that the representation quality of the base model moves up as their architecture discrepancy grows. This observation motivates us to propose a search strategy that quickly determines the most suitable auxiliary head for a specific base model to learn and several simple but effective methods to enlarge the model discrepancy. The HSSL is compatible with various self-supervised methods, achieving superior performances on various downstream tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection. The codes are available at https://github.com/NK-JittorCV/Self-Supervised/.

Abstract: Early wildfire detection (EWD) is of the utmost importance to enable rapid response efforts, and thus minimize the negative impacts of wildfire spreads.
  To this end, we present PYRONEAR-2025, a new dataset composed of both images and videos, allowing for the training and evaluation of smoke plume detection models, including sequential models. The data is sourced from: (i) web-scraped videos of wildfires from public networks of cameras for wildfire detection in-the-wild, (ii) videos from our in-house network of cameras, and (iii) a small portion of synthetic and real images.
  This dataset includes around 150,000 manual annotations on 50,000 images, covering 640 wildfires, PYRONEAR-2025 surpasses existing datasets in size and diversity. It includes data from France, Spain, Chile and the United States. Finally, it is composed of both images and videos, allowing for the training and evaluation of smoke plume detection models, including sequential models.
  We ran cross-dataset experiments using a lightweight state-of-the-art object detection model, as the ones used in-real-life, and found out the proposed dataset is particularly challenging, with F1 score of around 70\%, but more stable than existing datasets. Finally, its use in concordance with other public datasets helps to reach higher results overall.
  Last but not least, the video part of the dataset can be used to train a lightweight sequential model, improving global recall while maintaining precision for earlier detections.
  [We make both our code and data available online](https://github.com/joseg20/wildfires2025).

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly reshaped the trajectory of the AI revolution. Nevertheless, these LLMs exhibit a notable limitation, as they are primarily adept at processing textual information. To address this constraint, researchers have endeavored to integrate visual capabilities with LLMs, resulting in the emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). These advanced models are instrumental in tackling more intricate tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. In our comprehensive survey paper, we delve into the key advancements within the realm of VLMs. Our classification organizes VLMs into three distinct categories: models dedicated to vision-language understanding, models that process multimodal inputs to generate unimodal (textual) outputs and models that both accept and produce multimodal inputs and outputs.This classification is based on their respective capabilities and functionalities in processing and generating various modalities of data.We meticulously dissect each model, offering an extensive analysis of its foundational architecture, training data sources, as well as its strengths and limitations wherever possible, providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of its essential components. We also analyzed the performance of VLMs in various benchmark datasets. By doing so, we aim to offer a nuanced understanding of the diverse landscape of VLMs. Additionally, we underscore potential avenues for future research in this dynamic domain, anticipating further breakthroughs and advancements.

Abstract: Visual abstract reasoning is core to image processing. We present Valen, a unified probability-highlighting baseline that excels on both RPM (progression) and Bongard-Logo (clustering) tasks. Analysing its internals, we find solvers implicitly treat each task as a distribution where primary samples fit and auxiliaries do not; hence the learning target is jointly shaped by both sets, not by correct solutions alone. To close the gap we first introduce Tine, an adversarial adapter that nudges Valen toward correct-solution density, but adversarial training is unstable. We therefore replace it with Funny, a fast Gaussian-mixture model that directly estimates the correct-solution density without adversarial games, and extend the same paradigm to SBR for progressive-pattern planning. Extensive experiments show explicit distribution planning is the key to stronger, interpretable abstract reasoning.

Abstract: Poisoning attacks compromise the training phase of federated learning (FL) such that the learned global model misclassifies attacker-chosen inputs called target inputs. Existing defenses mainly focus on protecting the training phase of FL such that the learnt global model is poison free. However, these defenses often achieve limited effectiveness when the clients' local training data is highly non-iid or the number of malicious clients is large, as confirmed in our experiments. In this work, we propose FLForensics, the first poison-forensics method for FL. FLForensics complements existing training-phase defenses. In particular, when training-phase defenses fail and a poisoned global model is deployed, FLForensics aims to trace back the malicious clients that performed the poisoning attack after a misclassified target input is identified. We theoretically show that FLForensics can accurately distinguish between benign and malicious clients under a formal definition of poisoning attack. Moreover, we empirically show the effectiveness of FLForensics at tracing back both existing and adaptive poisoning attacks on five benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Depression is characterized by persistent sadness and loss of interest, significantly impairing daily functioning and now a widespread mental disorder. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on subjective assessments, necessitating objective approaches for accurate diagnosis. Our study investigates the use of facial action units (AUs) and emotions as biomarkers for depression. We analyzed facial expressions from video data of participants classified with or without depression. Our methodology involved detailed feature extraction, mean intensity comparisons of key AUs, and the application of time series classification models. Furthermore, we employed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and various clustering algorithms to explore the variability in emotional expression patterns. Results indicate significant differences in the intensities of AUs associated with sadness and happiness between the groups, highlighting the potential of facial analysis in depression assessment.

Abstract: Autonomous driving, particularly navigating complex and unanticipated scenarios, demands sophisticated reasoning and planning capabilities. While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer a promising avenue for this, their use has been largely confined to understanding complex environmental contexts or generating high-level driving commands, with few studies extending their application to end-to-end path planning. A major research bottleneck is the lack of large-scale annotated datasets encompassing vision, language, and action. To address this issue, we propose CoVLA (Comprehensive Vision-Language-Action) Dataset, an extensive dataset comprising real-world driving videos spanning more than 80 hours. This dataset leverages a novel, scalable approach based on automated data processing and a caption generation pipeline to generate accurate driving trajectories paired with detailed natural language descriptions of driving environments and maneuvers. This approach utilizes raw in-vehicle sensor data, allowing it to surpass existing datasets in scale and annotation richness. Using CoVLA, we investigate the driving capabilities of MLLMs that can handle vision, language, and action in a variety of driving scenarios. Our results illustrate the strong proficiency of our model in generating coherent language and action outputs, emphasizing the potential of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in the field of autonomous driving. This dataset establishes a framework for robust, interpretable, and data-driven autonomous driving systems by providing a comprehensive platform for training and evaluating VLA models, contributing to safer and more reliable self-driving vehicles. The dataset is released for academic purpose.

Abstract: Generative modeling and clustering are conventionally distinct tasks in machine learning. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been widely explored for their ability to integrate both, providing a framework for generative clustering. However, while VAEs can learn meaningful cluster representations in latent space, they often struggle to generate high-quality samples. This paper addresses this problem by introducing TreeDiffusion, a deep generative model that conditions diffusion models on learned latent hierarchical cluster representations from a VAE to obtain high-quality, cluster-specific generations. Our approach consists of two steps: first, a VAE-based clustering model learns a hierarchical latent representation of the data. Second, a cluster-aware diffusion model generates realistic images conditioned on the learned hierarchical structure. We systematically compare the generative capabilities of our approach with those of alternative conditioning strategies. Empirically, we demonstrate that conditioning diffusion models on hierarchical cluster representations improves the generative performance on real-world datasets compared to other approaches. Moreover, a key strength of our method lies in its ability to generate images that are both representative and specific to each cluster, enabling more detailed visualization of the learned latent structure. Our approach addresses the generative limitations of VAE-based clustering approaches by leveraging their learned structure, thereby advancing the field of generative clustering.

Abstract: Photography during night or in dark conditions typically suffers from noise, low light and blurring issues due to the dim environment and the common use of long exposure. Although Deblurring and Low-light Image Enhancement (LLIE) are related under these conditions, most approaches in image restoration solve these tasks separately. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust neural network for multi-task low-light image restoration. Instead of following the current tendency of Transformer-based models, we propose new attention mechanisms to enhance the receptive field of efficient CNNs. Our method reduces the computational costs in terms of parameters and MAC operations compared to previous methods. Our model, DarkIR, achieves new state-of-the-art results on the popular LOLBlur, LOLv2 and Real-LOLBlur datasets, being able to generalize on real-world night and dark images.

Abstract: The rise of the generative models quality during the past years enabled the generation of edited variations of images at an important scale. To counter the harmful effects of such technology, the Image Difference Captioning (IDC) task aims to describe the differences between two images. While this task is successfully handled for simple 3D rendered images, it struggles on real-world images. The reason is twofold: the training data-scarcity, and the difficulty to capture fine-grained differences between complex images. To address those issues, we propose in this paper a simple yet effective framework to both adapt existing image captioning models to the IDC task and augment IDC datasets. We introduce BLIP2IDC, an adaptation of BLIP2 to the IDC task at low computational cost, and show it outperforms two-streams approaches by a significant margin on real-world IDC datasets. We also propose to use synthetic augmentation to improve the performance of IDC models in an agnostic fashion. We show that our synthetic augmentation strategy provides high quality data, leading to a challenging new dataset well-suited for IDC named Syned1.

Abstract: Transductive zero-shot learning with vision-language models leverages image-image similarities within the dataset to achieve better classification accuracy compared to the inductive setting. However, there is little work that explores the structure of the language space in this context. We propose GTA-CLIP, a novel technique that incorporates supervision from language models for joint transduction in language and vision spaces. Our approach is iterative and consists of three steps: (i) incrementally exploring the attribute space by querying language models, (ii) an attribute-augmented transductive inference procedure, and (iii) fine-tuning the language and vision encoders based on inferred labels within the dataset. Through experiments with CLIP encoders, we demonstrate that GTA-CLIP, yields an average performance improvement of 8.6% and 3.7% across 12 datasets and 3 encoders, over CLIP and transductive CLIP respectively in the zero-shot setting. We also observe similar improvements in a few-shot setting. We present ablation studies that demonstrate the value of each step and visualize how the vision and language spaces evolve over iterations driven by the transductive learning. Code is released at https://github.com/cvl-umass/GTA-CLIP

Abstract: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), chemicals found in products like non-stick cookware, are unfortunately persistent environmental pollutants with severe health risks. Accurately mapping PFAS contamination is crucial for guiding targeted remediation efforts and protecting public and environmental health, yet detection across large regions remains challenging due to the cost of testing and the difficulty of simulating their spread. In this work, we introduce FOCUS, a geospatial deep learning framework with a label noise-aware loss function, to predict PFAS contamination in surface water over large regions. By integrating hydrological flow data, land cover information, and proximity to known PFAS sources, our approach leverages both spatial and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. We evaluate the performance of our approach through extensive ablation studies, robustness analysis, real-world validation, and comparative analyses against baselines like sparse segmentation, as well as existing scientific methods, including Kriging and pollutant transport simulations. Results and expert feedback highlight our framework's potential for scalable PFAS monitoring.

Abstract: It remains a significant challenge to compress images at extremely low bitrate while achieving both semantic consistency and high perceptual quality. Inspired by human progressive perception mechanism, we propose a Semantically Disentangled Image Compression framework (SEDIC) in this paper. Initially, an extremely compressed reference image is obtained through a learned image encoder. Then we leverage LMMs to extract essential semantic components, including overall descriptions, object detailed description, and semantic segmentation masks. We propose a training-free Object Restoration model with Attention Guidance (ORAG) built on pre-trained ControlNet to restore object details conditioned by object-level text descriptions and semantic masks. Based on the proposed ORAG, we design a multistage semantic image decoder to progressively restore the details object by object, starting from the extremely compressed reference image, ultimately generating high-quality and high-fidelity reconstructions. Experimental results demonstrate that SEDIC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior perceptual quality and semantic consistency at extremely low-bitrates ($\le$ 0.05 bpp).

Abstract: Erasing concepts from large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models has become increasingly crucial due to the growing concerns over copyright infringement, offensive content, and privacy violations. In scalable applications, fine-tuning-based methods are time-consuming to precisely erase multiple target concepts, while real-time editing-based methods often degrade the generation quality of non-target concepts due to conflicting optimization objectives. To address this dilemma, we introduce SPEED, an efficient concept erasure approach that directly edits model parameters. SPEED searches for a null space, a model editing space where parameter updates do not affect non-target concepts, to achieve scalable and precise erasure. To facilitate accurate null space optimization, we incorporate three complementary strategies: Influence-based Prior Filtering (IPF) to selectively retain the most affected non-target concepts, Directed Prior Augmentation (DPA) to enrich the filtered retain set with semantically consistent variations, and Invariant Equality Constraints (IEC) to preserve key invariants during the T2I generation process. Extensive evaluations across multiple concept erasure tasks demonstrate that SPEED consistently outperforms existing methods in non-target preservation while achieving efficient and high-fidelity concept erasure, successfully erasing 100 concepts within only 5 seconds. Our code and models are available at: https://github.com/Ouxiang-Li/SPEED.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video generative models (VGMs), it is essential to develop reliable and comprehensive automatic metrics for AI-generated videos (AIGVs). Existing methods either use off-the-shelf models optimized for other tasks or rely on human assessment data to train specialized evaluators. These approaches are constrained to specific evaluation aspects and are difficult to scale with the increasing demands for finer-grained and more comprehensive evaluations. To address this issue, this work investigates the feasibility of using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as a unified evaluator for AIGVs, leveraging their strong visual perception and language understanding capabilities. To evaluate the performance of automatic metrics in unified AIGV evaluation, we introduce a benchmark called UVE-Bench. UVE-Bench collects videos generated by state-of-the-art VGMs and provides pairwise human preference annotations across 15 evaluation aspects. Using UVE-Bench, we extensively evaluate 18 MLLMs. Our empirical results suggest that while advanced MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2VL-72B and InternVL2.5-78B) still lag behind human evaluators, they demonstrate promising ability in unified AIGV evaluation, significantly surpassing existing specialized evaluation methods. Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of key design choices that impact the performance of MLLM-driven evaluators, offering valuable insights for future research on AIGV evaluation.

Abstract: 3D scene understanding has been transformed by open-vocabulary language models that enable interaction via natural language. However, at present the evaluation of these representations is limited to datasets with closed-set semantics that do not capture the richness of language. This work presents OpenLex3D, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating 3D open-vocabulary scene representations. OpenLex3D provides entirely new label annotations for scenes from Replica, ScanNet++, and HM3D, which capture real-world linguistic variability by introducing synonymical object categories and additional nuanced descriptions. Our label sets provide 13 times more labels per scene than the original datasets. By introducing an open-set 3D semantic segmentation task and an object retrieval task, we evaluate various existing 3D open-vocabulary methods on OpenLex3D, showcasing failure cases, and avenues for improvement. Our experiments provide insights on feature precision, segmentation, and downstream capabilities. The benchmark is publicly available at: https://openlex3d.github.io/.

Abstract: The practical application of AI tools for specific computer vision tasks relies on the "small-data regime" of hundreds to thousands of labeled samples. This small-data regime is vital for applications requiring expensive expert annotations, such as ecological monitoring, medical diagnostics or industrial quality control. We find, however, that computer vision research has ignored the small data regime as evaluations increasingly focus on zero- and few-shot learning. We use the Natural World Tasks (NeWT) benchmark to compare multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and vision-only methods across varying training set sizes. MLLMs exhibit early performance plateaus, while vision-only methods improve throughout the small-data regime, with performance gaps widening beyond 10 training examples. We provide the first comprehensive comparison between these approaches in small-data contexts and advocate for explicit small-data evaluations in AI research to better bridge theoretical advances with practical deployments.

<title>DSM: Constructing a Diverse Semantic Map for 3D Visual Grounding</title>

Abstract: Effective scene representation is critical for the visual grounding ability of representations, yet existing methods for 3D Visual Grounding are often constrained. They either only focus on geometric and visual cues, or, like traditional 3D scene graphs, lack the multi-dimensional attributes needed for complex reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Diverse Semantic Map (DSM) framework, a novel scene representation framework that enriches robust geometric models with a spectrum of VLM-derived semantics, including appearance, physical properties, and affordances. The DSM is first constructed online by fusing multi-view observations within a temporal sliding window, creating a persistent and comprehensive world model. Building on this foundation, we propose DSM-Grounding, a new paradigm that shifts grounding from free-form VLM queries to a structured reasoning process over the semantic-rich map, markedly improving accuracy and interpretability. Extensive evaluations validate our approach's superiority. On the ScanRefer benchmark, DSM-Grounding achieves a state-of-the-art 59.06% overall accuracy of IoU@0.5, surpassing others by 10%. In semantic segmentation, our DSM attains a 67.93% F-mIoU, outperforming all baselines, including privileged ones. Furthermore, successful deployment on physical robots for complex navigation and grasping tasks confirms the framework's practical utility in real-world scenarios.

To address limitations arising from spatial domain feature fusion and insufficient receptive fields, this paper introduces SAIP-Net, a novel frequency-aware segmentation framework that leverages Spectral Adaptive Information Propagation. SAIP-Net employs adaptive frequency filtering and multi-scale receptive field enhancement to effectively suppress intra-class feature inconsistencies and sharpen boundary lines. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the effectiveness of spectral-adaptive strategies combined with expanded receptive fields for remote sensing image segmentation.

Abstract: Affordances are the potential actions an agent can perform on an object, as observed by a camera. Visual affordance prediction is formulated differently for tasks such as grasping detection, affordance classification, affordance segmentation, and hand pose estimation. This diversity in formulations leads to inconsistent definitions that prevent fair comparisons between methods. In this paper, we propose a unified formulation of visual affordance prediction by accounting for the complete information on the objects of interest and the interaction of the agent with the objects to accomplish a task. This unified formulation allows us to comprehensively and systematically review disparate visual affordance works, highlighting strengths and limitations of both methods and datasets. We also discuss reproducibility issues, such as the unavailability of methods implementation and experimental setups details, making benchmarks for visual affordance prediction unfair and unreliable. To favour transparency, we introduce the Affordance Sheet, a document that details the solution, datasets, and validation of a method, supporting future reproducibility and fairness in the community.

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has become the dominant approach for medical image segmentation, yet ensuring the reliability and clinical applicability of these models requires addressing key challenges such as annotation variability, calibration, and uncertainty estimation. This is why we created the Calibration and Uncertainty for multiRater Volume Assessment in multiorgan Segmentation (CURVAS), which highlights the critical role of multiple annotators in establishing a more comprehensive ground truth, emphasizing that segmentation is inherently subjective and that leveraging inter-annotator variability is essential for robust model evaluation. Seven teams participated in the challenge, submitting a variety of DL models evaluated using metrics such as Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Expected Calibration Error (ECE), and Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). By incorporating consensus and dissensus ground truth, we assess how DL models handle uncertainty and whether their confidence estimates align with true segmentation performance. Our findings reinforce the importance of well-calibrated models, as better calibration is strongly correlated with the quality of the results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that segmentation models trained on diverse datasets and enriched with pre-trained knowledge exhibit greater robustness, particularly in cases deviating from standard anatomical structures. Notably, the best-performing models achieved high DSC and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. This work underscores the need for multi-annotator ground truth, thorough calibration assessments, and uncertainty-aware evaluations to develop trustworthy and clinically reliable DL-based medical image segmentation models.

<title>VideoRFT: Incentivizing Video Reasoning Capability in MLLMs via Reinforced Fine-Tuning</title>

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) has shown great promise in achieving humanlevel reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), and has recently been extended to MLLMs. Nevertheless, reasoning about videos, which is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, remains a persistent challenge due to the complex logic, temporal and causal structures inherent in video data. To fill this gap, we propose VideoRFT, a novel approach that extends the RFT paradigm to cultivate human-like video reasoning capabilities in MLLMs. VideoRFT follows the standard two-stage scheme in RFT: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to improve generalization. A central challenge to achieve this in the video domain lies in the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality video CoT datasets. We address this by building a multi-expert-driven, cognition-inspired CoT curation pipeline. First, we devise a cognition-inspired prompting strategy to elicit a reasoning LLM to generate preliminary CoTs based solely on rich, structured, and literal representations of video content. Subsequently, these CoTs are revised by a MLLM conditioned on the actual video, ensuring visual consistency and reducing visual hallucinations. This pipeline results in two new datasets, i.e.VideoRFT-CoT-102K for SFT and VideoRFT-RL-310K for RL. To further strengthen the RL phase, we introduce a novel semantic-consistency reward that explicitly promotes the alignment between textual reasoning and visual evidence. This reward encourages the model to produce coherent, context-aware reasoning outputs grounded in visual input. Extensive experiments show that VideoRFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six video reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Worldwide image geolocalization-the task of predicting GPS coordinates from images taken anywhere on Earth-poses a fundamental challenge due to the vast diversity in visual content across regions. While recent approaches adopt a two-stage pipeline of retrieving candidates and selecting the best match, they typically rely on simplistic similarity heuristics and point-wise supervision, failing to model spatial relationships among candidates. In this paper, we propose GeoRanker, a distance-aware ranking framework that leverages large vision-language models to jointly encode query-candidate interactions and predict geographic proximity. In addition, we introduce a multi-order distance loss that ranks both absolute and relative distances, enabling the model to reason over structured spatial relationships. To support this, we curate GeoRanking, the first dataset explicitly designed for geographic ranking tasks with multimodal candidate information. GeoRanker achieves state-of-the-art results on two well-established benchmarks (IM2GPS3K and YFCC4K), significantly outperforming current best methods.

Abstract: While an image is worth more than a thousand words, only a few provide crucial information for a given task and thus should be focused on. In light of this, ideal text-to-image (T2I) retrievers should prioritize specific visual attributes relevant to queries. To evaluate current retrievers on handling attribute-focused queries, we build COCO-Facet, a COCO-based benchmark with 9,112 queries about diverse attributes of interest. We find that CLIP-like retrievers, which are widely adopted due to their efficiency and zero-shot ability, have poor and imbalanced performance, possibly because their image embeddings focus on global semantics and subjects while leaving out other details. Notably, we reveal that even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based, stronger retrievers with a larger output dimension struggle with this limitation. Hence, we hypothesize that retrieving with general image embeddings is suboptimal for performing such queries. As a solution, we propose to use promptable image embeddings enabled by these multimodal retrievers, which boost performance by highlighting required attributes. Our pipeline for deriving such embeddings generalizes across query types, image pools, and base retriever architectures. To enhance real-world applicability, we offer two acceleration strategies: Pre-processing promptable embeddings and using linear approximations. We show that the former yields a 15% improvement in Recall@5 when prompts are predefined, while the latter achieves an 8% improvement when prompts are only available during inference.

Abstract: Embodied AI has developed rapidly in recent years, but it is still mainly deployed in laboratories, with various distortions in the Real-world limiting its application. Traditionally, Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods are applied to predict human preferences for distorted images; however, there is no IQA method to assess the usability of an image in embodied tasks, namely, the perceptual quality for robots. To provide accurate and reliable quality indicators for future embodied scenarios, we first propose the topic: IQA for Embodied AI. Specifically, we (1) based on the Mertonian system and meta-cognitive theory, constructed a perception-cognition-decision-execution pipeline and defined a comprehensive subjective score collection process; (2) established the Embodied-IQA database, containing over 36k reference/distorted image pairs, with more than 5m fine-grained annotations provided by Vision Language Models/Vision Language Action-models/Real-world robots; (3) trained and validated the performance of mainstream IQA methods on Embodied-IQA, demonstrating the need to develop more accurate quality indicators for Embodied AI. We sincerely hope that through evaluation, we can promote the application of Embodied AI under complex distortions in the Real-world. Project page: https://github.com/lcysyzxdxc/EmbodiedIQA

Abstract: We propose AdapTok, an adaptive temporal causal video tokenizer that can flexibly allocate tokens for different frames based on video content. AdapTok is equipped with a block-wise masking strategy that randomly drops tail tokens of each block during training, and a block causal scorer to predict the reconstruction quality of video frames using different numbers of tokens. During inference, an adaptive token allocation strategy based on integer linear programming is further proposed to adjust token usage given predicted scores. Such design allows for sample-wise, content-aware, and temporally dynamic token allocation under a controllable overall budget. Extensive experiments for video reconstruction and generation on UCF-101 and Kinetics-600 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Without additional image data, AdapTok consistently improves reconstruction quality and generation performance under different token budgets, allowing for more scalable and token-efficient generative video modeling.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed the potential of training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning ability for enhancing vision-language navigation (VLN) performance, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches predominantly adopt straightforward input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose EvolveNav, a novel sElf-improving embodied reasoning paradigm that realizes adaptable and generalizable navigational reasoning for boosting LLM-based vision-language Navigation. Specifically, EvolveNav involves a two-stage training process: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model with curated formalized CoT labels to first activate the model's navigational reasoning capabilities, and simultaneously increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A self-reflective auxiliary task is also designed to encourage the model to learn correct reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results under both task-specific and cross-task training paradigms demonstrate the consistent superiority of EvolveNav over previous LLM-based VLN approaches on various popular benchmarks, including R2R, REVERIE, CVDN, and SOON. Code is available at https://github.com/expectorlin/EvolveNav.

Abstract: Classical image filters, such as those for averaging or differencing, are carefully normalized to ensure consistency, interpretability, and to avoid artifacts like intensity shifts, halos, or ringing. In contrast, convolutional filters learned end-to-end in deep networks lack such constraints. Although they may resemble wavelets and blob/edge detectors, they are not normalized in the same or any way. Consequently, when images undergo atmospheric transfer, their responses become distorted, leading to incorrect outcomes. We address this limitation by proposing filter normalization, followed by learnable scaling and shifting, akin to batch normalization. This simple yet effective modification ensures that the filters are atmosphere-equivariant, enabling co-domain symmetry. By integrating classical filtering principles into deep learning (applicable to both convolutional neural networks and convolution-dependent vision transformers), our method achieves significant improvements on artificial and natural intensity variation benchmarks. Our ResNet34 could even outperform CLIP by a large margin. Our analysis reveals that unnormalized filters degrade performance, whereas filter normalization regularizes learning, promotes diversity, and improves robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Pose estimation from unordered images is fundamental for 3D reconstruction, robotics, and scientific imaging. Recent geometric foundation models, such as DUSt3R, enable end-to-end dense 3D reconstruction but remain underexplored in scientific imaging fields like cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) for near-atomic protein reconstruction. In cryo-EM, pose estimation and 3D reconstruction from unordered particle images still depend on time-consuming iterative optimization, primarily due to challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and distortions from the contrast transfer function (CTF). We introduce CryoFastAR, the first geometric foundation model that can directly predict poses from Cryo-EM noisy images for Fast ab initio Reconstruction. By integrating multi-view features and training on large-scale simulated cryo-EM data with realistic noise and CTF modulations, CryoFastAR enhances pose estimation accuracy and generalization. To enhance training stability, we propose a progressive training strategy that first allows the model to extract essential features under simpler conditions before gradually increasing difficulty to improve robustness. Experiments show that CryoFastAR achieves comparable quality while significantly accelerating inference over traditional iterative approaches on both synthetic and real datasets.

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital pathology and advances in self-supervised deep learning have enabled the development of foundational models for various pathology tasks across diverse diseases. While multimodal approaches integrating diverse data sources have emerged, a critical gap remains in the comprehensive integration of whole-slide images (WSIs) with spatial transcriptomics (ST), which is crucial for capturing critical molecular heterogeneity beyond standard hematoxylin & eosin (H&amp;E) staining. We introduce SPADE, a foundation model that integrates histopathology with ST data to guide image representation learning within a unified framework, in effect creating an ST-informed latent space. SPADE leverages a mixture-of-data experts technique, where experts are created via two-stage imaging feature-space clustering using contrastive learning to learn representations of co-registered WSI patches and gene expression profiles. Pre-trained on the comprehensive HEST-1k dataset, SPADE is evaluated on 20 downstream tasks, demonstrating significantly superior few-shot performance compared to baseline models, highlighting the benefits of integrating morphological and molecular information into one latent space. Code and pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/uclabair/SPADE.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in integrating vision and language for complex reasoning. While most existing benchmarks evaluate models under offline settings with a fixed set of pre-recorded inputs, we introduce OST-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate Online Spatio-Temporal understanding from the perspective of an agent actively exploring a scene. The Online aspect emphasizes the need to process and reason over incrementally acquired observations, while the Spatio-Temporal component requires integrating current visual inputs with historical memory to support dynamic spatial reasoning. OST-Bench better reflects the challenges of real-world embodied perception. Built on an efficient data collection pipeline, OST-Bench consists of 1.4k scenes and 10k question-answer pairs collected from ScanNet, Matterport3D, and ARKitScenes. We evaluate several leading MLLMs on OST-Bench and observe that they fall short on tasks requiring complex spatio-temporal reasoning. Under the online setting, their accuracy declines as the exploration horizon extends and the memory grows. Through further experimental analysis, we identify common error patterns across models and find that both complex clue-based spatial reasoning demands and long-term memory retrieval requirements significantly drop model performance along two separate axes, highlighting the core challenges that must be addressed to improve online embodied reasoning. To foster further research and development in the field, our codes, dataset, and benchmark are available. Our project page is: https://rbler1234.github.io/OSTBench.github.io/

Abstract: Agricultural parcels serve as basic units for conducting agricultural practices and applications, which is vital for land ownership registration, food security assessment, soil erosion monitoring, etc. However, existing agriculture parcel extraction studies only focus on mid-resolution mapping or regular plain farmlands while lacking representation of complex terraced terrains due to the demands of precision agriculture.In this paper, we introduce a more fine-grained terraced parcel dataset named GTPBD (Global Terraced Parcel and Boundary Dataset), which is the first fine-grained dataset covering major worldwide terraced regions with more than 200,000 complex terraced parcels with manual annotation. GTPBD comprises 47,537 high-resolution images with three-level labels, including pixel-level boundary labels, mask labels, and parcel labels. It covers seven major geographic zones in China and transcontinental climatic regions around the world.Compared to the existing datasets, the GTPBD dataset brings considerable challenges due to the: (1) terrain diversity; (2) complex and irregular parcel objects; and (3) multiple domain styles. Our proposed GTPBD dataset is suitable for four different tasks, including semantic segmentation, edge detection, terraced parcel extraction, and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) tasks.Accordingly, we benchmark the GTPBD dataset on eight semantic segmentation methods, four edge extraction methods, three parcel extraction methods, and five UDA methods, along with a multi-dimensional evaluation framework integrating pixel-level and object-level metrics. GTPBD fills a critical gap in terraced remote sensing research, providing a basic infrastructure for fine-grained agricultural terrain analysis and cross-scenario knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in image generation. However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and pruning weights responsible for triggering verbatim training data replication, based on the assumption that memorization can be localized. We challenge this assumption and demonstrate that, even after such pruning, small perturbations to the text embeddings of previously mitigated prompts can re-trigger data replication, revealing the fragility of such defenses. Our further analysis then provides multiple indications that memorization is indeed not inherently local: (1) replication triggers for memorized images are distributed throughout text embedding space; (2) embeddings yielding the same replicated image produce divergent model activations; and (3) different pruning methods identify inconsistent sets of memorization-related weights for the same image. Finally, we show that bypassing the locality assumption enables more robust mitigation through adversarial fine-tuning. These findings provide new insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and inform the development of more reliable mitigations against DM memorization.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration. (3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/NiceRingNode/SPECTRUM.

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems. While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult. Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

Abstract: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL) for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning. Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments. Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated videos and comparison results are in our project page.

<title>Levarging Learning Bias for Noisy Anomaly Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fully unsupervised image anomaly detection (FUIAD), where training data may contain unlabeled anomalies. Conventional methods assume anomaly-free training data, but real-world contamination leads models to absorb anomalies as normal, degrading detection performance. To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that systematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias stems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to prioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2) feature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class consistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model responses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set into subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to filter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset. Experiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection and localization performance under different noise conditions. Ablation studies further validate the framework's contamination resilience, emphasizing the critical role of learning bias exploitation. The model-agnostic design ensures compatibility with diverse unsupervised backbones, offering a practical solution for real-world scenarios with imperfect training data. Code is available at https://github.com/hustzhangyuxin/LLBNAD.

<title>Boosting Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation via Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation</title>

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA). Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network (DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation. Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models, which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data, The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations, we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

Abstract: Understanding how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process low-level visual features is critical for evaluating their perceptual abilities and has not been systematically characterized. Inspired by human psychophysics, we introduce a behavioural method for estimating the Contrast Sensitivity Function (CSF) in MLLMs by treating them as end-to-end observers. Models are queried with structured prompts while viewing noise-based stimuli filtered at specific spatial frequencies. Psychometric functions are derived from the binary verbal responses, and contrast thresholds (and CSFs) are obtained without relying on internal activations or classifier-based proxies. Our results reveal that some models resemble human CSFs in shape or scale, but none capture both. We also find that CSF estimates are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, indicating limited linguistic robustness. Finally, we show that CSFs predict model performance under frequency-filtered and adversarial conditions. These findings highlight systematic differences in frequency tuning across MLLMs and establish CSF estimation as a scalable diagnostic tool for multimodal perception.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been applied to autonomous driving to support decision-making in complex real-world scenarios. However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive alternative to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without compromising performance.

Abstract: As a critical task in video sequence classification within computer vision, Online Action Detection (OAD) has garnered significant attention. The sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA) model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features. Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs), cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) relies on deep neural networks trained with large-scale labeled datasets. However, creating such datasets is expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability of perception systems. Sim2Real learning offers a scalable alternative, but its success depends on the simulation's fidelity to real-world environments, dynamics, and sensors. This tutorial introduces a reproducible workflow for building high-fidelity digital twins (HiFi DTs) to generate realistic synthetic datasets. We outline practical steps for modeling static geometry, road infrastructure, and dynamic traffic using open-source resources such as satellite imagery, OpenStreetMap, and sensor specifications. The resulting environments support scalable and cost-effective data generation for robust Sim2Real learning. Using this workflow, we have released three synthetic LiDAR datasets, namely UT-LUMPI, UT-V2X-Real, and UT-TUMTraf-I, which closely replicate real locations and outperform real-data-trained baselines in perception tasks. This guide enables broader adoption of HiFi DTs in ITS research and deployment.

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos. EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial, temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings. Project page: https://taiyi98.github.io/projects/EgoGazeVQA

Abstract: The advancement of Embodied AI heavily relies on large-scale, simulatable 3D scene datasets characterized by scene diversity and realistic layouts. However, existing datasets typically suffer from limitations in data scale or diversity, sanitized layouts lacking small items, and severe object collisions. To address these shortcomings, we introduce \textbf{InternScenes}, a novel large-scale simulatable indoor scene dataset comprising approximately 40,000 diverse scenes by integrating three disparate scene sources, real-world scans, procedurally generated scenes, and designer-created scenes, including 1.96M 3D objects and covering 15 common scene types and 288 object classes. We particularly preserve massive small items in the scenes, resulting in realistic and complex layouts with an average of 41.5 objects per region. Our comprehensive data processing pipeline ensures simulatability by creating real-to-sim replicas for real-world scans, enhances interactivity by incorporating interactive objects into these scenes, and resolves object collisions by physical simulations. We demonstrate the value of InternScenes with two benchmark applications: scene layout generation and point-goal navigation. Both show the new challenges posed by the complex and realistic layouts. More importantly, InternScenes paves the way for scaling up the model training for both tasks, making the generation and navigation in such complex scenes possible. We commit to open-sourcing the data, models, and benchmarks to benefit the whole community.

Abstract: Image hiding is often referred to as steganography, which aims to hide a secret image in a cover image of the same resolution. Many steganography models are based on genera-tive adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, most existing models suffer from mode collapse. Mode collapse will lead to an information imbalance between the cover and secret images in the stego image and further affect the subsequent extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes StegOT, an autoencoder-based steganography model incorporating optimal transport theory. We designed the multiple channel optimal transport (MCOT) module to transform the feature distribution, which exhibits multiple peaks, into a single peak to achieve the trade-off of information. Experiments demonstrate that we not only achieve a trade-off between the cover and secret images but also enhance the quality of both the stego and recovery images. The source code will be released on https://github.com/Rss1124/StegOT.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation has been widely studied in medical image segmentation as a tool to provide reliability, particularly in deep learning approaches. However, previous methods generally lack effective supervision in uncertainty estimation, leading to low interpretability and robustness of the predictions. In this work, we propose a self-supervised approach to guide the learning of uncertainty. Specifically, we introduce three principles about the relationships between the uncertainty and the image gradients around boundaries and noise. Based on these principles, two uncertainty supervision losses are designed. These losses enhance the alignment between model predictions and human interpretation. Accordingly, we introduce novel quantitative metrics for evaluating the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method can achieve competitive segmentation performance and superior results in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios while significantly improving the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity, especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long); and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation. With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains 20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal quality loss.

Abstract: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse modalities remains a central challenge in computer graphics, animation, and human-computer interaction. We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality, responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal human motion generation.

Abstract: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113 meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles, and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets (e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity (64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models' ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic, establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/L-O-I/IWR-Bench.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability. Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage. 2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945 real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image understanding. All data and code are available at https://github.com/Yuan-Hou/Human-MME.

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for 3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the 3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective, framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates, to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU memory to process thousands of images.

<title>Pathology-CoT: Learning Visual Chain-of-Thought Agent from Expert Whole Slide Image Diagnosis Behavior</title>

Abstract: Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process of changing magnification and moving between fields. Although recent pathology foundation models demonstrated superior performances, practical agentic systems that decide what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable diagnoses are still lacking. Such limitation is largely bottlenecked by data: scalable, clinically aligned supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not documented in textbooks or internet, and therefore absent from LLM training. Here we introduce a framework designed to address this challenge through three key breakthroughs. First, the AI Session Recorder seamlessly integrates with standard whole-slide image viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs into standardized behavioral commands and bounding boxes. Second, a lightweight human-in-the-loop review turns AI-drafted rationales for behavioral commands into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired "where to look" and "why it matters", enabling six-fold faster labeling compared to manual constructing such Chain-of-Thought dataset. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathology-o3, a two-stage agent that first proposes important ROIs and then performs behavior-guided reasoning. On the gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection task, our method achieved 100 recall on the internal validation from Stanford Medicine and 97.6 recall on an independent external validation from Sweden, exceeding the state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our knowledge, Pathology-CoT constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D scanning is essential for preserving cultural heritage artefacts, supporting documentation, analysis, and long-term conservation. However, conventional methods typically require specialized expertise and manual intervention to maintain optimal scanning conditions and coverage. We present an automated two-robot scanning system that eliminates the need for handheld or semi-automatic workflows by combining coordinated robotic manipulation with high-resolution 3D scanning. Our system parameterizes the scanning space into distinct regions, enabling coordinated motion planning between a scanner-equipped robot and a tray-handling robot. Optimized trajectory planning and waypoint distribution ensure comprehensive surface coverage, minimize occlusions, and balance reconstruction accuracy with system efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significantly lower Chamfer Distance and higher F-score compared to baseline methods, offering superior geometric accuracy, improved digitization efficiency, and reduced reliance on expert operators.

Abstract: Benthic habitat mapping is fundamental for understanding marine ecosystems, guiding conservation efforts, and supporting sustainable resource management. Yet, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets limits the development and benchmarking of machine learning models in this domain. This paper introduces a thorough multi-modal dataset, comprising about a million side-scan sonar (SSS) tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Approximately \num{36000} of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable supervised fine-tuning of classification models. All the raw sensor data, together with mosaics, are also released to support further exploration and algorithm development. To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles, facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance accessibility and encourage research. This resource aims to establish a standardized benchmark for underwater habitat mapping, promoting advancements in autonomous seafloor classification and multi-sensor integration.

Abstract: In Mathematical Morphology for grey-level functions, an image is analysed by another image named the structuring function. This structuring function is translated over the image domain and summed to the image. However, in an image presenting lighting variations, the amplitude of the structuring function should vary according to the image intensity. Such a property is not verified in Mathematical Morphology for grey level functions, when the structuring function is summed to the image with the usual additive law. In order to address this issue, a new framework is defined with an additive law for which the amplitude of the structuring function varies according to the image amplitude. This additive law is chosen within the Logarithmic Image Processing framework and models the lighting variations with a physical cause such as a change of light intensity. The new framework is named Logarithmic Mathematical Morphology (LMM) and allows the definition of operators which are robust to such lighting variations.

Abstract: The AI-based assisted diagnosis programs have been widely investigated on medical ultrasound images. Complex scenario of ultrasound image, in which the coupled interference of internal and external factors is severe, brings a unique challenge for localize the object region automatically and precisely in ultrasound images. In this study, we seek to propose a more general and robust Benchmark Attention Adaptive Framework (BAAF) to assist doctors segment or diagnose lesions and tissues in ultrasound images more quickly and accurately. Different from existing attention schemes, the BAAF consists of a parallel hybrid attention module (PHAM) and an adaptive calibration mechanism (ACM). Specifically, BAAF first coarsely calibrates the input features from the channel and spatial dimensions, and then adaptively selects more robust lesion or tissue characterizations from the coarse-calibrated feature maps. The design of BAAF further optimizes the "what" and "where" focus and selection problems in CNNs and seeks to improve the segmentation accuracy of lesions or tissues in medical ultrasound images. The method is evaluated on four medical ultrasound segmentation tasks, and the adequate experimental results demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the comparison with existing attention mechanisms also demonstrates the superiority of BAAF. This work provides the possibility for automated medical ultrasound assisted diagnosis and reduces reliance on human accuracy and precision.

<title>OmniLens: Towards Universal Lens Aberration Correction via LensLib-to-Specific Domain Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Emerging universal Computational Aberration Correction (CAC) paradigms provide an inspiring solution to light-weight and high-quality imaging with a universal model trained on a lens library (LensLib) to address arbitrary lens aberrations blindly. However, the limited coverage of existing LensLibs leads to poor generalization of the trained models to unseen lenses, whose fine-tuning pipeline is also confined to the lens-descriptions-known case. In this work, we introduce OmniLens, a flexible solution to universal CAC via (i) establishing a convincing LensLib with comprehensive coverage for pre-training a robust base model, and (ii) adapting the model to any specific lens designs with unknown lens descriptions via fast LensLib-to-specific domain adaptation. To achieve these, an Evolution-based Automatic Optical Design (EAOD) pipeline is proposed to generate a rich variety of lens samples with realistic aberration behaviors. Then, we design an unsupervised regularization term for efficient domain adaptation on a few easily accessible real-captured images based on the statistical observation of dark channel priors in degradation induced by lens aberrations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LensLib generated by EAOD effectively develops a universal CAC model with strong generalization capabilities, which can also improve the non-blind lens-specific methods by 0.35-1.81dB in PSNR. Additionally, the proposed domain adaptation method significantly improves the base model, especially in severe aberration cases (at most 2.59dB in PSNR). The code and data will be available at https://github.com/zju-jiangqi/OmniLens.

Abstract: The optimal bit-width for achieving the best trade-off between quantized model size and accuracy has been a subject of ongoing debate. While some advocate for 4-bit quantization, others propose that 1.58-bit offers superior results. However, the lack of a cohesive framework for different bits has left such conclusions relatively tenuous. We present ParetoQ, the first unified framework that facilitates rigorous comparisons across 1-bit, 1.58-bit, 2-bit, 3-bit, and 4-bit quantization settings. Our findings reveal a notable learning transition between 2 and 3 bits: For 3-bits and above, the fine-tuned models stay close to their original pre-trained distributions, whereas for learning 2-bit networks or below, the representations change drastically. By optimizing training schemes and refining quantization functions, ParetoQ surpasses all previous methods tailored to specific bit widths. Remarkably, our ParetoQ ternary 600M-parameter model even outperforms the previous SoTA ternary 3B-parameter model in accuracy, using only one-fifth of the parameters. Extensive experimentation shows that ternary, 2-bit, and 3-bit quantization maintains comparable performance in the size-accuracy trade-off and generally exceeds 4-bit and binary quantization. Considering hardware constraints, 2-bit quantization offers promising potential for memory reduction and speedup.

Abstract: Real-time acquisition of accurate scene depth is essential for automated robotic minimally invasive surgery. Stereo matching with binocular endoscopy can provide this depth information. However, existing stereo matching methods, designed primarily for natural images, often struggle with endoscopic images due to fuzzy tissue boundaries and typically fail to meet real-time requirements for high-resolution endoscopic image inputs. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{RRESM}, a real-time stereo matching method tailored for endoscopic images. Our approach integrates a 3D Mamba Coordinate Attention module that enhances cost aggregation through position-sensitive attention maps and long-range spatial dependency modeling via the Mamba block, generating a robust cost volume without substantial computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce a High-Frequency Disparity Optimization module that refines disparity predictions near tissue boundaries by amplifying high-frequency details in the wavelet domain. Evaluations on the SCARED and SERV-CT datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art matching accuracy with a real-time inference speed of 42 FPS. The code is available at https://github.com/Sonne-Ding/RRESM.

Abstract: Realistic digital garment modeling remains a labor-intensive task due to the intricate process of translating 2D sewing patterns into high-fidelity, simulation-ready 3D garments. We introduce GarmageNet, a unified generative framework that automates the creation of 2D sewing patterns, the construction of sewing relationships, and the synthesis of 3D garment initializations compatible with physics-based simulation. Central to our approach is Garmage, a novel garment representation that encodes each panel as a structured geometry image, effectively bridging the semantic and geometric gap between 2D structural patterns and 3D garment geometries. Followed by GarmageNet, a latent diffusion transformer to synthesize panel-wise geometry images and GarmageJigsaw, a neural module for predicting point-to-point sewing connections along panel contours. To support training and evaluation, we build GarmageSet, a large-scale dataset comprising 14,801 professionally designed garments with detailed structural and style annotations. Our method demonstrates versatility and efficacy across multiple application scenarios, including scalable garment generation from multi-modal design concepts (text prompts, sketches, photographs), automatic modeling from raw flat sewing patterns, pattern recovery from unstructured point clouds, and progressive garment editing using conventional instructions, laying the foundation for fully automated, production-ready pipelines in digital fashion.

Abstract: Neural Metamorphosis (NeuMeta) is a recent paradigm for generating neural networks of varying width and depth. Based on Implicit Neural Representation (INR), NeuMeta learns a continuous weight manifold, enabling the direct generation of compressed models, including those with configurations not seen during training. While promising, the original formulation of NeuMeta proves effective only for the final layers of the undelying model, limiting its broader applicability. In this work, we propose a training algorithm that extends the capabilities of NeuMeta to enable full-network metamorphosis with minimal accuracy degradation. Our approach follows a structured recipe comprising block-wise incremental training, INR initialization, and strategies for replacing batch normalization. The resulting metamorphic networks maintain competitive accuracy across a wide range of compression ratios, offering a scalable solution for adaptable and efficient deployment of deep models. The code is available at: https://github.com/TSommariva/HTTY_NeuMeta.

Abstract: Reconstruction and joint embedding have emerged as two leading paradigms in Self Supervised Learning (SSL). Reconstruction methods focus on recovering the original sample from a different view in input space. On the other hand, joint embedding methods align the representations of different views in latent space. Both approaches offer compelling advantages, yet practitioners lack clear guidelines for choosing between them. In this work, we unveil the core mechanisms that distinguish each paradigm. By leveraging closed form solutions for both approaches, we precisely characterize how the view generation process, e.g. data augmentation, impacts the learned representations. We then demonstrate that, unlike supervised learning, both SSL paradigms require a minimal alignment between augmentations and irrelevant features to achieve asymptotic optimality with increasing sample size. Our findings indicate that in scenarios where these irrelevant features have a large magnitude, joint embedding methods are preferable because they impose a strictly weaker alignment condition compared to reconstruction based methods. These results not only clarify the trade offs between the two paradigms but also substantiate the empirical success of joint embedding approaches on real world challenging datasets.

Abstract: Whole-body audio-driven avatar pose and expression generation is a critical task for creating lifelike digital humans and enhancing the capabilities of interactive virtual agents, with wide-ranging applications in virtual reality, digital entertainment, and remote communication. Existing approaches often generate audio-driven facial expressions and gestures independently, which introduces a significant limitation: the lack of seamless coordination between facial and gestural elements, resulting in less natural and cohesive animations. To address this limitation, we propose AsynFusion, a novel framework that leverages diffusion transformers to achieve harmonious expression and gesture synthesis. The proposed method is built upon a dual-branch DiT architecture, which enables the parallel generation of facial expressions and gestures. Within the model, we introduce a Cooperative Synchronization Module to facilitate bidirectional feature interaction between the two modalities, and an Asynchronous LCM Sampling strategy to reduce computational overhead while maintaining high-quality outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsynFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating real-time, synchronized whole-body animations, consistently outperforming existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: The integration of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), in particular electroencephalography (EEG), with artificial intelligence (AI) has shown tremendous promise in decoding human cognition and behavior from neural signals. In particular, the rise of multimodal AI models have brought new possibilities that have never been imagined before. Here, we present EgoBrain --the world's first large-scale, temporally aligned multimodal dataset that synchronizes egocentric vision and EEG of human brain over extended periods of time, establishing a new paradigm for human-centered behavior analysis. This dataset comprises 61 hours of synchronized 32-channel EEG recordings and first-person video from 40 participants engaged in 29 categories of daily activities. We then developed a muiltimodal learning framework to fuse EEG and vision for action understanding, validated across both cross-subject and cross-environment challenges, achieving an action recognition accuracy of 66.70%. EgoBrain paves the way for a unified framework for brain-computer interface with multiple modalities. All data, tools, and acquisition protocols are openly shared to foster open science in cognitive computing.

Abstract: Brightfield microscopy of unstained live cells is challenging due to low contrast, dynamic morphology, uneven illumination, and lack of labels. Deep learning achieved SOTA performance on stained, high-contrast images but needs large labeled datasets, expensive hardware, and fails under uneven illumination. This study presents a low-cost, lightweight, annotation-free segmentation method by introducing one-time calibration-assisted unsupervised framework adaptable across imaging modalities and image type. The framework determines background via spatial standard deviation from the local mean. Uncertain pixels are resolved using fuzzy logic, cumulative squared shift of nodal intensity, statistical features, followed by post-segmentation denoising calibration which is saved as a profile for reuse until noise pattern or object type substantially change. The program runs as a script or graphical interface for non-programmers. The method was rigorously evaluated using \textit{IoU}, \textit{F1-score}, and other metrics, with statistical significance confirmed via Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. On unstained brightfield myoblast (C2C12) images, it outperformed \textit{Cellpose 3.0} and \textit{StarDist}, improving IoU by up to 48\% (average IoU = 0.43, F1 = 0.60). In phase-contrast microscopy, it achieved a mean IoU of 0.69 and an F1-score of 0.81 on the \textit{LIVECell} dataset ($n = 3178$), with substantial expert agreement ($\kappa > 0.75$) confirming cross-modality robustness. Successful segmentation of laser-affected polymer surfaces further confirmed cross-domain robustness. By introducing the \textit{Homogeneous Image Plane} concept, this work provides a new theoretical foundation for training-free, annotation-free segmentation. The framework operates efficiently on CPU, avoids cell staining, and is practical for live-cell imaging and biomedical applications.

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at https://github.com/aimagelab/mammoth.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) represent abnormal cell division associated with poor prognosis. Yet their detection remains difficult due to low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG 2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple domains. In this work, we fine-tuned the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision transformer, pretrained on natural images, using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), training only ~1.3M parameters in combination with extensive augmentation and a domain-weighted Focal Loss to handle domain heterogeneity. Despite the domain gap, our fine-tuned DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology, reaching first place on the final test set. These results highlight the advantages of DINOv3 pretraining and underline the efficiency and robustness of our fine-tuning strategy, yielding state-of-the-art results for the atypical mitosis classification challenge in MIDOG 2025.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.11354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis framework designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical application-particularly in cell transplantation for personalised medicine and muscle regeneration therapies. The access to the application is available for reproducibility.

Summary:
In this paper, the authors address the challenges in evaluating deformable image registration (DIR) methods by proposing a novel evaluation scheme. They introduce Alignment Regularity Characteristic (ARC) curves, which provide a spectrum of performance under various levels of regularity. By using representative deep learning DIR methods with different network architectures and transformation models, they highlight the unique insights that ARC curves offer compared to traditional evaluation practices.

Abstract: Evaluating deformable image registration (DIR) is challenging due to the inherent trade-off between achieving high alignment accuracy and maintaining deformation regularity. However, most existing DIR works either address this trade-off inadequately or overlook it altogether. In this paper, we highlight the issues with existing practices and propose an evaluation scheme that captures the trade-off continuously to holistically evaluate DIR methods. We first introduce the alignment regularity characteristic (ARC) curves, which describe the performance of a given registration method as a spectrum under various degrees of regularity. We demonstrate that the ARC curves reveal unique insights that are not evident from existing evaluation practices, using experiments on representative deep learning DIR methods with various network architectures and transformation models. We further adopt a HyperNetwork based approach that learns to continuously interpolate across the full regularization range, accelerating the construction and improving the sample density of ARC curves. Finally, we provide general guidelines for a nuanced model evaluation and selection using our evaluation scheme for both practitioners and registration researchers.

<div> Keywords: long-tailed semi-supervised learning, Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG), dynamic filtering mechanism, Bayes-optimal classifier, class-aware adaptive augmentation

Summary:
The paper introduces a Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework for long-tailed semi-supervised learning. Unlike existing methods, CPG does not assume a predefined distribution for unlabeled data, making it more robust and effective. The framework operates through a dynamic filtering mechanism that incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into the labeled dataset. This ensures that the updated labeled dataset follows a known distribution, leading to improved model training. CPG also utilizes a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit adjustment and introduces a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to enhance minority class representation. By leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples, CPG achieves significant improvements in accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 15.97%. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that the optimization cycle in CPG can reduce generalization error under certain conditions. The code for CPG is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03993v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current long-tailed semi-supervised learning methods assume that labeled data exhibit a long-tailed distribution, and unlabeled data adhere to a typical predefined distribution (i.e., long-tailed, uniform, or inverse long-tailed). However, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may follow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution. Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions. Additionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further improve the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to maximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples. Comprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that CPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to $\textbf{15.97%}$ in accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved significant progress in multimodal understanding tasks, demonstrating strong capabilities particularly in general tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. However, when dealing with specialized cultural heritage domains like 3D vase artifacts, existing models face severe data scarcity issues and insufficient domain knowledge limitations.

Summary: Video understanding is a complex field in computer vision that requires models to reason about intricate relationships and multimodal evidence. Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs) have shown impressive capabilities in this area, but the post-training phase is crucial for transforming them into sophisticated reasoning engines. This survey examines post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and test-time scaling (TTS). The survey provides a structured taxonomy to clarify the roles and adaptations of these techniques, addressing challenges like temporal localization and multimodal evidence integration. Key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols are synthesized, along with identification of open challenges in reward design and scalability. Essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics are curated to aid in rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness.

Abstract: Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer vision, requiring models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships, long-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence. The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

Summary: 
The article introduces Contrastive Noise Optimization to address the limited diversity issue in Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models. Existing methods optimizing intermediate latents or text conditions during inference often result in outputs collapsing into similar modes under strong text guidance. In contrast, the proposed approach shapes the initial noise latents to promote diverse outputs. By defining a contrastive loss in Tweedie data space and optimizing a batch of noise latents, diverse outputs are maximized while maintaining fidelity to a reference sample. The method is shown to achieve a superior quality-diversity Pareto frontier across various T2I backbones and remains robust to hyperparameter choices. The theoretical insights provided into the mechanism of this preprocessing further support its effectiveness. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating high-fidelity images, largely enabled by text-guided inference. However, this advantage often comes with a critical drawback: limited diversity, as outputs tend to collapse into similar modes under strong text guidance. Existing approaches typically optimize intermediate latents or text conditions during inference, but these methods deliver only modest gains or remain sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Noise Optimization, a simple yet effective method that addresses the diversity issue from a distinct perspective. Unlike prior techniques that adapt intermediate latents, our approach shapes the initial noise to promote diverse outputs. Specifically, we develop a contrastive loss defined in the Tweedie data space and optimize a batch of noise latents. Our contrastive optimization repels instances within the batch to maximize diversity while keeping them anchored to a reference sample to preserve fidelity. We further provide theoretical insights into the mechanism of this preprocessing to substantiate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior quality-diversity Pareto frontier while remaining robust to hyperparameter choices.

The article introduces a novel multimodal fusion strategy called Multi-expert Modality-incomplete Learning Network (MMLNet) to address the challenge of detecting fake news in scenarios where modalities are incomplete. MMLNet leverages Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning to compensate for missing modalities, Incomplete Modality Adapters to utilize new feature distributions, and Modality Missing Learning with label-aware adaptive weighting for robust representation learning. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world benchmarks across multiple languages, demonstrating superior performance and simplicity. By improving fake news detection accuracy in incomplete modality scenarios caused by information dissemination, MMLNet effectively mitigates the spread of misinformation.

Abstract: Multimodal fake news detection (MFND) has become an urgent task with the emergence of huge multimodal fake content on social media platforms. Previous studies mainly focus on complex feature extraction and fusion to learn discriminative information from multimodal content. However, in real-world applications, multimedia news may naturally lose some information during dissemination, resulting in modality incompleteness, which is detrimental to the generalization and robustness of existing models. To this end, we propose a novel generic and robust multimodal fusion strategy, termed Multi-expert Modality-incomplete Learning Network (MMLNet), which is simple yet effective. It consists of three key steps: (1) Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning to compensate for missing modalities by dynamically leveraging complementary information through multiple experts. (2) Incomplete Modality Adapters compensates for the missing information by leveraging the new feature distribution. (3) Modality Missing Learning leveraging an label-aware adaptive weighting strategy to learn a robust representation with contrastive learning. We evaluate MMLNet on three real-world benchmarks across two languages, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relative simplicity. By ensuring the accuracy of fake news detection in incomplete modality scenarios caused by information propagation, MMLNet effectively curbs the spread of malicious misinformation. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhyhome/MMLNet.

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed. We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with 5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2 from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90 age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%, specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early Batten disease detection.

Summary:
Omni Swift Action Tokenizer is introduced to improve the efficiency of Auto-regressive (AR) models in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) tasks. It utilizes B-Spline encoding and multi-stage residual quantization to compress action representations, shortening training sequences and reducing target entropy. The tokenization process results in faster AR training convergence and improved model performance. A cross-embodiment learning strategy is developed to leverage robot and human demonstrations for scalable auxiliary supervision. OmniSAT demonstrates higher compression rates while maintaining reconstruction quality in diverse real-robot and simulation experiments. Overall, OmniSAT offers a compact and transferable action representation, leading to more efficient AR training and improved VLA model performance. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining. To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer, which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training convergence and model performance.

<div> Keywords: MODIS, change detection, knowledge-driven, multi-task learning, spatial-spectral-temporal

Summary:
The paper introduces KAMamba, a novel approach for MODIS change detection. It addresses challenges such as mixed pixels and background class heterogeneity by leveraging knowledge of class transitions through a knowledge-driven approach. The method includes a knowledge-aware transition loss to enhance detection accuracies. A multi-task learning approach is used to improve model constraints with three different losses. Novel spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba modules are designed to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series. The method also utilizes a sparse and deformable Mamba backbone to improve efficiency and reduce computational costs. Evaluation on a MODIS time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada shows significant gains in F1 for change detection and improvements in overall accuracy, average accuracy, and Kappa for land-use/land-cover classification. <div>

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss), and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning. Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6% gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2% improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net, existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

Summary: 
Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle facial changes that reveal genuine emotions, valuable in lie detection and psychological assessment. A novel MER method is proposed with two key contributions. First, two complementary representations - Temporal-ranked dynamic image and Motion-intensity dynamic image - enhance discriminative ME features. Second, an Adaptive fusion network automatically integrates these representations, improving performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, MMEW) show the method's superiority. It achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new benchmark, 82.47 Accuracy and 0.665 UF1 on SAMM with balanced recognition, and 76.00 Accuracy on MMEW, demonstrating generalization ability. Results emphasize the importance of input and architecture in MER performance, laying a foundation for affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis, and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations - Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and 0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability. The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer interaction.

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications, including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However, deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups, overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets, methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex, real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and adaptive CVS.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal large language models, AttWarp, perceptual grounding, spatial relations, cross-modal attention

Summary:
AttWarp is a new method introduced to enhance the performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by reallocating spatial resolution in cluttered scenes. By using cross-modal attention, AttWarp performs rectilinear warping of input images to prioritize query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas. This method preserves global context while making small details and spatial relations more easily discernible. Across various benchmarks and MLLMs, AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens compositional reasoning, and reduces errors. The approach outperforms competitive baselines by focusing on relevant information while maintaining overall image structure. These results indicate that attention-guided warping is effective in enhancing the capabilities of MLLMs by optimizing the distribution of image information based on query relevance. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas, all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image, reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important, without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA, DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when given such warped inputs.

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

Summary:
This study addresses the issue of fixed resolution assumptions in visual large language models (VLLMs) for vision-language applications. The researchers investigate the resolution preferences of various vision-language tasks and find a correlation between resolution preferences, image complexity, and uncertainty variance of VLLMs at different image input resolutions. They propose an empirical formula to determine the optimal resolution for a given task based on these factors. Additionally, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique is introduced to extend the visual input resolution of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Rigorous experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method across a range of vision-language tasks. This research provides valuable insights for improving the performance of VLLMs in real-world applications by adapting the resolution based on task requirements.

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our method.

Summary:
This paper explores the use of synthetic face data to improve Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD) performance, addressing the challenges of limited access to large-scale bona fide image datasets due to privacy concerns. The study employs various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation methods and implements an incremental testing protocol to assess generalization capabilities with the addition of synthetic images. Results indicate that incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images can enhance generalization, but indiscriminate use may lead to sub-optimal performance. Interestingly, utilizing only synthetic data, including morphed and non-morphed images, produces the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), suggesting that relying solely on synthetic data may not be the most effective strategy in operational scenarios. This study sheds light on the benefits and limitations of integrating synthetic face data into S-MAD systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training. However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

- Ceb extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries using a revised Watershed algorithm and constructs boundary signatures for boundary candidates by sampling pixels from the boundaries.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity, which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge, we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries), to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance segmentation methods.

Summary:
Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning (CAPEL) addresses the limitations of conventional prompt ensembling in vision-language models. By preserving the cluster nature of context prompts, CAPEL improves classification by representing class clusters with distinct prompts. Ensembling in the classification logits space aligns better with the visual feature distribution, enhancing model performance. A cluster-preserving regularization term ensures prompt distinctiveness and prevents collapse into a uniform direction. The integration of adaptive prompt weighting dynamically adjusts attention weights for prompts, leading to robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks. Overall, CAPEL enhances the effectiveness of vision-language models by optimizing prompt ensembling and maintaining cluster-specific discriminative power. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning (CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction. Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts, ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

Summary: 
Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for association, but it can be unreliable with similar or occluded objects and is computationally expensive for segmentation masks. In this work, depth and mask features are fused and passed through a self-supervised encoder to produce stable object representations for matching. Using depth maps and object masks for fine-grained spatial cues, the MOT method refines segmentation masks without computing masks IoU. The tracking-by-detection (TBD) model, which is more computationally efficient, outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging benchmarks with non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and DanceTrack. Competitive performance is achieved on simpler benchmarks with linear motion, such as MOT17.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with linear motion, such as MOT17.

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content (UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG: Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos, transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse, and real-world UGC dataset. The dataset is publicly available at: https://shreshthsaini.github.io/CHUG/.

Summary:<br /><br /> 
The article proposes scene-adaptive strategies for efficiently allocating representation capacity in generating immersive indoor environment experiences from incomplete observations. It utilizes geometric priors to guide optimal base placement, improving upon uniform arrangements used in scalable Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) representations. Additionally, scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints are suggested to compensate for geometric deficiencies in input trajectory configurations and provide necessary regularization. By recording observation statistics on estimated geometric scaffolds, the approach enhances rendering quality and reduces memory requirements in large-scale indoor scenes.

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

<div> Gaussian, scene representation, novel-view synthesis, long-term chronology, 3D environments
Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach called LTGS for efficient scene representation and visualization from sparse-view updates in casual captures. It addresses challenges in capturing everyday environments with frequent changes by modeling long-term scene chronology through Gaussian splatting. Object templates as template Gaussians are used to create structural priors for shared object tracks, which are refined to adapt to temporal variations. The framework is designed to be generalizable across multiple time steps and is evaluated using real-world datasets. Results show that LTGS outperforms other baselines in reconstruction quality and provides fast and lightweight updates. The proposed method demonstrates the ability to handle abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations, making it a promising solution for capturing real-world environments effectively. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures. However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations, significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

Summary:
The research introduces a comprehensive framework for multi-view pose estimation in animal behavior studies. The framework combines novel training methods, post-processing techniques, and model distillation to enhance accuracy and efficiency. The multi-view transformer (MVT) incorporates pretrained backbones and cross-view correspondences without camera calibration, with added geometric consistency for calibrated setups. An Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor is enhanced for better uncertainty quantification. A distillation procedure leverages improved EKS predictions to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, reducing manual labeling dependence. The framework outperforms existing methods across various animal species, providing a practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation in real-world data scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees), with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation, surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking. The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features, enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition, and environmental monitoring tasks.

Summary:<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.09924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration, reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both general image and aligned face datasets.

Summary:
- Underwater images are essential for ocean research but often have poor quality due to environmental factors.
- Current image enhancement methods have limitations in generalization and dataset quality.
- Lack of diversity and low-quality images in datasets hinders progress.
- Proposed solution includes expanding datasets with various image types using a denoising diffusion model.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets, and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

<div> Implicit Neural Representations, longitudinal MRI data, brain aging trajectories, deep learning, dementia-like subjects <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a novel method for representing aging trajectories in the human brain using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) to model subject-specific longitudinal MRI data. Traditional deep learning methods struggle with discrete neuroimaging data due to different spatial and temporal sampling patterns, which the INR-based approach overcomes by representing the data as continuous functions. The study develops a biologically grounded trajectory simulation to generate MRI data for healthy and dementia-like subjects at regular and irregular timepoints. In the experiment with irregular sampling, the INR-based method outperforms a standard deep learning model, achieving an accuracy of 81.3% in classifying brain aging trajectories. This research contributes to a better understanding of the structural changes in the aging brain and provides a more effective tool for analyzing longitudinal neuroimaging data. <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.09936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves 81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task, outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

<div> Keywords: Segmentation models, human-in-the-loop, interventional learning, dataset biases, data-efficient

Summary:
This article introduces a human-in-the-loop interactive framework for improving segmentation models by incorporating human corrections to address spurious correlations and enhance real-world performance. The system leverages human interventions to guide the model towards more robust, semantically meaningful features and away from dataset-specific artifacts. Through iterative feedback, the framework effectively enhances segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points on challenging cubemap data, reduces annotation effort by 3-4 times compared to standard retraining, and maintains competitive performance on benchmark datasets. The approach systematically identifies and corrects model failure modes to improve generalization in diverse domains like urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving. Overall, this framework offers practical guidance for building accurate, robust, data-efficient segmentation systems adaptable to real-world applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate, robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

Summary: <br />
Challenges affecting accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection include diverse imaging devices, inconsistent lighting conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To address these challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this study. The framework includes the use of a multi-scenario dataset, STP-AgriData, to tackle tone variation. Data augmentations for lighting conditions, and a novel REAS-Det network for object scale variation and occlusion. The proposed network achieved high precision (87.6%), recall (74.9%), mAP@.50 (82.8%), and mAP@.50:.95 (53.3%) metrics, outperforming existing detection methods. The network incorporates RFAConv and C3RFEM modules for scale variation, MultiSEAM and soft-NMS for occlusion, demonstrating superior performance. The study paves the way for accurate quantity detection of Shatian pomelo in agricultural settings to meet commercial demands for lean production. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.09948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset, STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art detection methods.

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions, is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model. Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&amp;Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of 1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across architectures and datasets.

Summary: This study introduces an AI-based framework that utilizes existing traffic camera infrastructure for accurate and scalable traffic monitoring. By fine-tuning a YOLOv11 model on localized urban scenes, the framework extracts multimodal traffic density and classification metrics in real time. A novel graph-based viewpoint normalization method addresses inconsistencies from non-stationary cameras. Additionally, a large language model processes massive data to generate automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns. Validated using over 9 million images from NYC traffic cameras during congestion pricing rollout, results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger vehicle density in the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume reductions, and increased pedestrian and cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Example-based prompts improve the numerical accuracy of the large language model and reduce hallucinations. This framework has the potential to be a practical solution for large-scale, policy-relevant traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.<br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

<br />
Summary: 
The study focuses on addressing the challenge of lens flare in images by proposing a physics-informed method for flare data generation. This method involves creating parameterized templates, applying the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and utilizing a physical engine for 3D rendering. The resulting dataset, FlareX, combines both 2D and 3D perspectives, offering 9,500 2D templates and 3,000 flare image pairs. Additionally, a masking approach is designed to extract real-world flare-free images from corrupted ones, enabling the evaluation of model performance on real-world images. Through extensive experiments, the effectiveness of the method and dataset in improving model generalization to real-world scenarios is demonstrated. <div>

Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation, the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both 2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and dataset.

<div> Dataset, Flicker artifacts, Rolling shutter cameras, Retinex-based synthesis, Flicker removal 

Summary:
The article addresses flicker artifacts in short-exposure images caused by rolling shutter cameras and AC-powered lighting variations. These artifacts manifest as uneven brightness distribution and affect tasks like object detection. The lack of a large-scale dataset hinders flicker removal research progress. To fill this gap, BurstDeflicker dataset is introduced through three data acquisition methods. A Retinex-based synthesis pipeline allows manipulation of flicker attributes for diverse patterns. Real-world images capture spatial and temporal flicker characteristics, enhancing model generalization. A green-screen method introduces motion in image pairs for dynamic scenes. Experimental results showcase the dataset's effectiveness in advancing flicker removal research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting. These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity, area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker removal.

Unified medical vision language model MIMO is introduced, incorporating visual referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. A comprehensive multimodal dataset, MIMOSeg, is developed with 895K samples. MIMO combines visual clues and text instructions, and grounds medical terminologies in the image output. Experiment results demonstrate MIMO's effectiveness in various medical multimodal tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.10011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

Summary:
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter) is introduced as a lightweight visual adapter module for enhancing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in video captioning tasks. By incorporating learnable query tokens and a gating layer into the Vision Encoder, Q-Adapter efficiently extracts sparse, caption-relevant features without the need for external textual supervision. The method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MSR-VTT and MSVD video captioning datasets, surpassing traditional fine-tuning approaches while using only 1.4% of the parameters. Additionally, the study provides insights into key hyperparameters and design choices that impact fine-tuning effectiveness, offering optimization strategies for adapter-based learning. These results demonstrate the potential of Q-Adapter in achieving a balance between caption quality and parameter efficiency, showcasing its scalability in video-language modeling.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning" paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task. Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness, providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning. These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for video-language modeling.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance, especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this, we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to \textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and real-world scenes, respectively.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames. Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

Summary:
ViTAR is a new framework for medical vision-language models that mimics the iterative reasoning process of human experts, enabling multi-step visual reasoning. By treating medical images as interactive objects and incorporating expert-like diagnostic behaviors in the training data, ViTAR outperforms existing models. The two-stage training strategy includes supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to optimize decision-making. Visual attention analysis shows that ViTAR increasingly focuses on clinically critical regions during the reasoning process, leading to improved performance. This approach enhances both the accuracy and reliability of medical AI systems. <div>

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues. In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising 1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the "think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of medical AI.

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly proposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included in this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and other related areas.

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically, we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

Summary:
Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked Autoencoders (PHG-MAE) is a novel approach that combines neural graphs with masked autoencoders for self-supervised pre-training in computer vision tasks. By randomly masking entire modalities, the model samples from the distribution of hyper-edges, improving performance and consistency. The model integrates pre-training and fine-tuning in a single loop and enables inference-time ensembles for enhanced prediction. Knowledge distillation can be applied to ensembles with minimal loss in performance, even with small models. The approach is demonstrated in outdoor UAV scenes but can be adapted to other domains like autonomous driving. A data-pipeline software streamlines the integration of pre-trained models for multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL), with an automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset provided. Technical details, code, and reproduction steps are publicly available.
<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL) scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset. All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.

Summary: 
This study introduces a novel framework for tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a vision foundation model. By converting discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video sequence, the framework leverages a vision model developed for video segmentation to track landslide scar evolution. The framework incorporates knowledge-guided, auto-propagation, and interactive refinement techniques to ensure accurate identification of landslide scars. Through validation on the Baige and Sela landslides, the framework successfully tracks the evolution of landslide scars, enabling the identification of failure precursors for early warning and post-failure evolution assessment. This approach proves valuable for understanding mechanisms and precursors of landslides and assessing long-term stability and secondary hazards.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors, enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification. Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided, auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars, capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

Summary:
Gesplat introduces a novel framework for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis that overcomes the limitations of existing methods like Neural Radiance Fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting. By leveraging the VGGT foundation model for initial poses and point clouds, Gesplat enables robust reconstruction from sparse, unposed images. Key innovations include a hybrid Gaussian representation, graph-guided attribute refinement, and flow-based depth regularization for improved depth estimation accuracy. The approach demonstrates superior performance on various datasets, outperforming pose-dependent methods. Gesplat's ability to generate geometrically consistent reconstructions and high-quality novel views without the need for accurate camera poses makes it a promising solution for applications in sparse-view settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

A partial prompt aggregation protocol is implemented for effective collaboration and personalization, with visual prompts aggregated centrally and text prompts kept locally.

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP) have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative \underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}). Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to baseline methods.

<br />
Summary: 
Recent research has shown that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards can improve reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs) for complex tasks like video and image understanding. However, existing methods may lead to inconsistencies between the reasoning process and final answers. To address this issue, Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning (ACRE) modifies the standard GRPO algorithm by introducing an auxiliary consistency check. ACRE prompts the model to predict a second answer after generating a chain of thought and initial answer for a question, with shuffled answer options. By designing a consistency-verification reward that rewards agreement between original and post-shuffle answers, ACRE mitigates reasoning-answer misalignment and biases. Experiments on challenging Video Reasoning and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks show that ACRE outperforms the GRPO baseline, achieving significant improvements in answer consistency and correctness. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning (ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check. After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\% and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the GRPO baseline.

<div> detection, YOLOv5n, YOLOv8n, uncertainty, post-detection <br />
Summary: <br />
Accurate fire and smoke detection are crucial for safety and disaster response. Vision-based methods like YOLOv5n and YOLOv8n are popular but may result in false positives and missed detections due to reduced capacity. Conventional post-detection techniques like Non-Maximum Suppression sometimes fail in cluttered fire scenes. To address these issues, a new uncertainty-aware post-detection framework is proposed. This framework incorporates statistical uncertainty and domain-specific visual cues to rescale detection confidences using a Confidence Refinement Network. Experiments on the D-Fire dataset show enhanced precision, recall, and mean average precision compared to existing methods, with minimal computational overhead. Post-detection rescoring proves to be effective in improving the robustness of compact deep learning models for fire and smoke detection. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke detection.

<br />
The article introduces the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a training-free framework that utilizes multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for image manipulation localization (IML) tasks. ICFC combines objectified rule construction and adaptive filtering to create a robust knowledge base and a progressive reasoning pipeline. This framework mimics expert forensic workflows, allowing for image-level classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability. ICFC outperforms existing training-free methods and competes with both weakly and fully supervised approaches on various benchmarks. The integration of MLLM reasoning within ICFC results in improved performance and interpretability in IML tasks, providing a valuable tool for addressing the ongoing challenges posed by advances in image tampering.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations. Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability. Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

<div> immersive iris recognition, egocentric applications, off-axis acquisition, ImmerIris dataset, normalization-free paradigm 
Summary: 
Immersive iris recognition in egocentric applications is becoming popular, but traditional systems designed for on-axis iris imagery face challenges in off-axis acquisition. The ImmerIris dataset, containing over 499,000 ocular images from 564 subjects, addresses this gap as one of the largest public datasets for off-axis acquisition. Evaluation protocols based on ImmerIris highlight the shortcomings of current recognition methods, primarily due to normalization techniques. A normalization-free paradigm proposed in this paper shows superior performance by directly learning from ocular images with minimal adjustment. This approach offers a promising direction for robust recognition in immersive settings, indicating the importance of adapting techniques for off-axis iris acquisition in applications such as augmented and virtual reality.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.10113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion, intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture. Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets, containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment. Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust immersive recognition.

Summary: 
This study proposes a novel multi-class Parkinson's disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced CNN BiLSTM model. The researchers collected finger tapping videos and extracted temporal, frequency, and amplitude features from wrist and hand movements. The hybrid deep learning framework, integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention mechanisms, demonstrated promising results in classifying PD severity levels. The model reshapes input sequences, captures spatial dependencies through a Conv1D MaxPooling block, and models temporal dynamics using BiLSTM layers. An attention mechanism highlights informative temporal features, improving the model's performance in distinguishing between severity classes. The integration of spatial-temporal representations with attention mechanisms shows potential for non-invasive PD severity detection, offering a valuable tool for clinicians in monitoring and tracking disease progression. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency, and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently, low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed. According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7 percent according to the validation set.

Abstract: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues, three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference. Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline - while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%. Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time detection requirements. These findings demonstrate the suitability of YOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments, showcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture.

<div> Keywords: Color3D, 3D colorization, dynamic scenes, personalized colorizer, Lab color space<br />
Summary: <br />
Color3D is a new framework for colorizing both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs. It preserves color diversity and controllability, while ensuring consistency across views and time steps. By colorizing a single key view and fine-tuning a personalized colorizer, the method can propagate colors to novel views and frames. This personalized colorizer learns a scene-specific color mapping, enabling consistent projection of colors. The framework simplifies 3D colorization by treating it as a single image problem, allowing integration of different colorization models. Extensive experiments show that Color3D produces more consistent and chromatically rich 3D renderings with precise user control. The framework uses Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation for direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes. Overall, Color3D provides a flexible and versatile solution for realistic and visually appealing 3D colorization. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.10152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view, enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich renderings with precise user control.

<title>ReMix: Towards a Unified View of Consistent Character Generation and Editing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1) have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts, pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models. The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool, integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality segmentation masks to process their data.

Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual concepts. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/CristianoPatricio/viconex-med.

<title>HccePose(BF): Predicting Front \&amp; Back Surfaces to Construct Ultra-Dense 2D-3D Correspondences for Pose Estimation</title>

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However, current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm. Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time, high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos. Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320 fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings, environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation, and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8% R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset and method. The code and dataset will be released.

<title>Fairness Without Labels: Pseudo-Balancing for Bias Mitigation in Face Gender Classification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10191</link>

Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2) stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81% overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary relational perception in 3D localization.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system, developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5 million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare cancer classification and multimodal Q&amp;A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

<title>A Style-Based Metric for Quantifying the Synthetic-to-Real Gap in Autonomous Driving Image Datasets</title>

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of data-driven autonomous driving systems.

<title>Semantic Visual Anomaly Detection and Reasoning in AI-Generated Images</title>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies}, including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}. Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric (\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary, AnomReason and AnomAgent
  serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and interpretable AIGC forensics.

<title>Are Video Models Emerging as Zero-Shot Learners and Reasoners in Medical Imaging?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10254</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation, denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan, producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on 4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation models built on video models.

<title>Opacity-Gradient Driven Density Control for Compact and Efficient Few-Shot 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10257</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view synthesis.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

<title>Bridging Perspectives: Foundation Model Guided BEV Maps for 3D Object Detection and Tracking</title>

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2 features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .

arXiv:2510.10288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however, fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets, SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation, respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet scenes.

Abstract: Accurate traffic congestion classification is essential for intelligent transportation systems and real-time urban traffic management. This paper presents a multimodal framework combining open-vocabulary visual-language reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an ordinal scale from 1 (free flow) to 5 (severe congestion), enabling semantically aligned and temporally consistent classification. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate motion-based confidence weighting and generate annotated visual outputs. Experimental results show the model achieves 76.7 percent accuracy, an F1 score of 0.752, and a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) of 0.684, significantly outperforming unimodal baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in preserving ordinal structure and leveraging visual-language and motion modalities. Future enhancements include incorporating vehicle sizing and refined density metrics.

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\% inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\% reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of AI-driven monitoring systems.

arXiv:2510.10365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However, existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud completion.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion. Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact, surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks, notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations, such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other 2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets, Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior, enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised learning and motivates pavement cracks detection research.

<title>Identifying bias in CNN image classification using image scrambling and transforms</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10383</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box", where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning, not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller, non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly, making classification more challenging. The second method involves the application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms, and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without the need to use background information.

Abstract: Audiovisual video captioning aims to generate semantically rich descriptions with temporal alignment between visual and auditory events, thereby benefiting both video understanding and generation. In this paper, we present AVoCaDO, a powerful audiovisual video captioner driven by the temporal orchestration between audio and visual modalities. We propose a two-stage post-training pipeline: (1) AVoCaDO SFT, which fine-tunes the model on a newly curated dataset of 107K high-quality, temporally-aligned audiovisual captions; and (2) AVoCaDO GRPO, which leverages tailored reward functions to further enhance temporal coherence and dialogue accuracy while regularizing caption length and reducing collapse. Experimental results demonstrate that AVoCaDO significantly outperforms existing open-source models across four audiovisual video captioning benchmarks, and also achieves competitive performance on the VDC and DREAM-1K benchmark under visual-only settings.

<title>Mesh-Gait: A Unified Framework for Gait Recognition Through Multi-Modal Representation Learning from 2D Silhouettes</title>

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers, and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

<title>Guided Image Feature Matching using Feature Spatial Order</title>

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks. Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper, we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset, self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate feature matching than the traditional method.

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments. Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances (up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding in real-world scenarios.

<title>Towards Cybersickness Severity Classification from VR Gameplay Videos Using Transfer Learning and Temporal Modeling</title>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, its adoption across domains such as healthcare, education, and entertainment has grown significantly. However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by symptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance of VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches leveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there remains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for predicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing transfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos using the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features are then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the temporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over time. Our approach effectively leverages the time-series nature of video data, achieving a 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. This surpasses the performance of existing models trained solely on video data, providing a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate cybersickness in virtual environments. Furthermore, this work lays the foundation for future research on video-based temporal modeling for enhancing user comfort in VR applications.

<title>Taming a Retrieval Framework to Read Images in Humanlike Manner for Augmenting Generation of MLLMs</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10426</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities, positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors, but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment (reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward trustworthy reasoning.

<title>MonoSE(3)-Diffusion: A Monocular SE(3) Diffusion Framework for Robust Camera-to-Robot Pose Estimation</title>

arXiv:2510.10434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses, thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks (DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

<title>On the Problem of Consistent Anomalies in Zero-Shot Industrial Anomaly Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data. Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies -- similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.'' CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation, yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across architectures.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability (IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11% and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules: (1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA), progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient (PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The dataset and code are available.

<title>When Images Speak Louder: Mitigating Language Bias-induced Hallucinations in VLMs through Cross-Modal Guidance</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features. Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion. Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

<title>MSF-Mamba: Motion-aware State Fusion Mamba for Efficient Micro-Gesture Recognition</title>

arXiv:2510.10478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently, Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models (SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition, previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba (MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely, MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-, Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle, any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/dengyl20/SRF-LLaVA-1.5.

Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data. While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation, axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property. Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image generative models.

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention, producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh. The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures. Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene styling, and tileable texture generation.

<title>VR-Thinker: Boosting Video Reward Models through Thinking-with-Image Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning; and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6% on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

<title>Receptive Field Expanded Look-Up Tables for Vision Inference: Advancing from Low-level to High-level Tasks</title>

Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal, various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

Abstract: In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies, divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved generalization over single-modality approaches.

<title>Layout-Independent License Plate Recognition via Integrated Vision and Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10533</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a pattern-aware framework for automatic license plate recognition (ALPR), designed to operate reliably across diverse plate layouts and challenging real-world conditions. The proposed system consists of a modern, high-precision detection network followed by a recognition stage that integrates a transformer-based vision model with an iterative language modelling mechanism. This unified recognition stage performs character identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification. Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues, enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion, and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis within the recognition stage bridges computer vision and language modelling for enhanced adaptability in intelligent transportation and surveillance applications.

<title>MCE: Towards a General Framework for Handling Missing Modalities under Imbalanced Missing Rates</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10534</link>

arXiv:2510.10534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The journal preprint version is now available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2025.112591. Our code is available at https://github.com/byzhaoAI/MCE.

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution, GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of missed detection, false detection and low detection efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway environment, we proposed an improved algorithm MRS-YOLO based on YOLO11. Firstly, a multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module is proposed and fused with the C3k2 module to form C3k2_MAKDF, which enhances the model's feature extraction capability for foreign objects of different sizes and shapes. Secondly, a novel Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network (RCFPN) is designed as a neck structure to enhance the model's ability to integrate and utilize multi-level features effectively. Then, Spatial and Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect) based on spatial and channel preprocessing is designed to enhance the model's overall detection performance. Finally, the channel pruning technique is used to reduce the redundancy of the improved model, drastically reduce Parameters and Giga Floating Point Operations Per Second (GFLOPs), and improve the detection efficiency. The experimental results show that the mAP50 and mAP50:95 of the MRS-YOLO algorithm proposed in this paper are improved to 94.8% and 86.4%, respectively, which are 0.7 and 2.3 percentage points higher compared to the baseline, while Parameters and GFLOPs are reduced by 44.2% and 17.5%, respectively. It is demonstrated that the improved algorithm can be better applied to the task of foreign object detection in railroad transmission lines.

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep auto-encoder architecture, experiments realized on the DeepWeeds dataset and inference in noisy conditions demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of our method in comparison to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning models. Furthermore, we carried out ablation studies for an extended analysis of our proposed joint learning strategy.

<title>UniFlow: A Unified Pixel Flow Tokenizer for Visual Understanding and Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7 widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks, but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without guidance), respectively.

<title>Injecting Frame-Event Complementary Fusion into Diffusion for Optical Flow in Challenging Scenes</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10577</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

<title>Equipping Vision Foundation Model with Mixture of Experts for Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this, we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution. This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories, improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

<title>A Simple and Better Baseline for Visual Grounding</title>

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities, there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration, linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding, called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets comprehensively substantiate that the proposed FSVG achieves a better balance between accuracy and efficiency beyond the current state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at https://github.com/jcwang0602/FSVG.

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs) include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge, whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT, RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.

arXiv:2510.10609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training, using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and text-image alignment.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However, existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map. Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually. However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach (i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition, underlining our manual specification-free definition.

arXiv:2510.10660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy, while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at https://stablehdmap.github.io/.

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable facial representations to boost generalization across various face security tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically, we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training, vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on https://fsfm-3c.github.io/fsvfm.html.

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First, we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks. The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data and computational requirements associated with training video-language foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications. Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g., spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM, and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

<title>MSM-Seg: A Modality-and-Slice Memory Framework with Category-Agnostic Prompting for Multi-Modal Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions. While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/MSM-Seg.

<title>Action-Dynamics Modeling and Cross-Temporal Interaction for Online Action Understanding</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10682</link>

Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover, in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14, TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset -- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation for future action understanding research.

<title>Dynamic Gaussian Splatting from Defocused and Motion-blurred Monocular Videos</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10691</link>

arXiv:2510.10691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction. In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

Abstract: We present WorldMirror, an all-in-one, feed-forward model for versatile 3D geometric prediction tasks. Unlike existing methods constrained to image-only inputs or customized for a specific task, our framework flexibly integrates diverse geometric priors, including camera poses, intrinsics, and depth maps, while simultaneously generating multiple 3D representations: dense point clouds, multi-view depth maps, camera parameters, surface normals, and 3D Gaussians. This elegant and unified architecture leverages available prior information to resolve structural ambiguities and delivers geometrically consistent 3D outputs in a single forward pass. WorldMirror achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse benchmarks from camera, point map, depth, and surface normal estimation to novel view synthesis, while maintaining the efficiency of feed-forward inference. Code and models will be publicly available soon.

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors and adapt virtual environments accordingly.

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

Abstract: Identifying drones and birds correctly is essential for keeping the skies safe and improving security systems. Using the VIP CUP 2025 dataset, which provides both RGB and infrared (IR) images, this study presents EGD-YOLOv8n, a new lightweight yet powerful model for object detection. The model improves how image features are captured and understood, making detection more accurate and efficient. It uses smart design changes and attention layers to focus on important details while reducing the amount of computation needed. A special detection head helps the model adapt to objects of different shapes and sizes. We trained three versions: one using RGB images, one using IR images, and one combining both. The combined model achieved the best accuracy and reliability while running fast enough for real-time use on common GPUs.

<title>Structured Spectral Graph Learning for Multi-label Abnormality Classification in 3D Chest CT Scans</title>

arXiv:2510.10779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload. Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work, we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

<title>DISC-GAN: Disentangling Style and Content for Cluster-Specific Synthetic Underwater Image Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN (DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains. We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 13.3728.

<title>ImHead: A Large-scale Implicit Morphable Model for Localized Head Modeling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars. However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead, we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation, allowing the user to make localized edits.

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells (Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of highly dynamic objects.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2 (CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories: clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations. Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs. These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world applications.

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques, including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

arXiv:2510.10868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while slightly improving performance over the baseline.

Abstract: Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over real-world data.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches 34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases, achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&amp;CO. Beyond VLMs, the proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological alignment into representation learning.

<title>SceneTextStylizer: A Training-Free Scene Text Style Transfer Framework with Diffusion Model</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual fidelity and text preservation.

Abstract: The exponential growth of the global makeup market has paralleled advancements in virtual makeup simulation technology. Despite the progress led by GANs, their application still encounters significant challenges, including training instability and limited customization capabilities. Addressing these challenges, we introduce DreamMakup - a novel training-free Diffusion model based Makeup Customization method, leveraging the inherent advantages of diffusion models for superior controllability and precise real-image editing. DreamMakeup employs early-stopped DDIM inversion to preserve the facial structure and identity while enabling extensive customization through various conditioning inputs such as reference images, specific RGB colors, and textual descriptions. Our model demonstrates notable improvements over existing GAN-based and recent diffusion-based frameworks - improved customization, color-matching capabilities, identity preservation and compatibility with textual descriptions or LLMs with affordable computational costs.

<title>FG-CLIP 2: A Bilingual Fine-grained Vision-Language Alignment Model</title>

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions, with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges, we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

<title>DKPMV: Dense Keypoints Fusion from Multi-View RGB Frames for 6D Pose Estimation of Textureless Objects</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10933</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: 6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance. In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level fusion using only multi-view RGB images as input. We design a three-stage progressive pose optimization strategy that leverages dense multi-view keypoint geometry information. To enable effective dense keypoint fusion, we enhance the keypoint network with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training, improving prediction accuracy and resolving ambiguities on symmetric objects. Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that DKPMV outperforms state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and even surpasses the RGB-D methods in the majority of cases. The code will be available soon.

<title>Towards Distribution-Shift Uncertainty Estimation for Inverse Problems with Generative Priors</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10947</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or (iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out of distribution.

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning, thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on 3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models, introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question answering (QA) scenarios.

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.10986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM), which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal robustness.

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems, research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static, passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation, whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii) Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also actively update a public repository at https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian inpainting, a critical technique for numerous applications in virtual reality and multimedia, has made significant progress with pretrained diffusion models. However, ensuring multi-view consistency, an essential requirement for high-quality inpainting, remains a key challenge. In this work, we present PAInpainter, a novel approach designed to advance 3D Gaussian inpainting by leveraging perspective-aware content propagation and consistency verification across multi-view inpainted images. Our method iteratively refines inpainting and optimizes the 3D Gaussian representation with multiple views adaptively sampled from a perspective graph. By propagating inpainted images as prior information and verifying consistency across neighboring views, PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting quality, with PSNR scores of 26.03 dB and 29.51 dB on the SPIn-NeRF and NeRFiller datasets, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization capability.

arXiv:2510.11000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects. To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA), an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and overall visual quality.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas. Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform, extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

<title>COCO-Tree: Compositional Hierarchical Concept Trees for Enhanced Reasoning in Vision Language Models</title>

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image. Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground, EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

<title>High-Resolution Spatiotemporal Modeling with Global-Local State Space Models for Video-Based Human Pose Estimation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11017</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity; however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE. Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better computational trade-offs.

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of 3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency (GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset, we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at \href{https://hkust-longgroup.github.io/GIR-Bench}{https://hkust-longgroup.github.io/GIR-Bench}.

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning, embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data. Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks. However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP metrics, respectively.

Abstract: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardised datasets to enable reproducible deep learning (DL) model development. We present LaryngealCT, a curated benchmark of 1,029 computed tomography (CT) scans aggregated from six collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Uniform 1 mm isotropic volumes of interest encompassing the larynx were extracted using a weakly supervised parameter search framework validated by clinical experts. 3D DL architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) were benchmarked on (i) early (Tis,T1,T2) vs. advanced (T3,T4) and (ii) T4 vs. non-T4 classification tasks. 3D CNN (AUC-0.881, F1-macro-0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC-0.892, F1-macro-0.646) respectively outperformed the other models in the two tasks. Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations in T4 predictions. Through open-source data, pretrained models, and integrated explainability tools, LaryngealCT offers a reproducible foundation for AI-driven research to support clinical decisions in laryngeal oncology.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting, etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&amp;F}$ metrics for VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient, language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

Abstract: Patient face images provide a convenient mean for evaluating eye diseases, while also raising privacy concerns. Here, we introduce ROFI, a deep learning-based privacy protection framework for ophthalmology. Using weakly supervised learning and neural identity translation, ROFI anonymizes facial features while retaining disease features (over 98\% accuracy, $\kappa > 0.90$). It achieves 100\% diagnostic sensitivity and high agreement ($\kappa > 0.90$) across eleven eye diseases in three cohorts, anonymizing over 95\% of images. ROFI works with AI systems, maintaining original diagnoses ($\kappa > 0.80$), and supports secure image reversal (over 98\% similarity), enabling audits and long-term care. These results show ROFI's effectiveness of protecting patient privacy in the digital medicine era.

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting (OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks, enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion; and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

<title>Text-Enhanced Panoptic Symbol Spotting in CAD Drawings</title>

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex CAD drawings.

<title>Future-Aware End-to-End Driving: Bidirectional Modeling of Trajectory Planning and Scene Evolution</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds. Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene, then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories. Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of MLLMs in real world applications.

<title>Compositional Zero-Shot Learning: A Survey</title>

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example, ``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion, which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically consistent 3D scene motion.

Abstract: Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression, yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse, irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static (anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs, prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification and general ICU prediction tasks.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces, transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6 featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization across settings.

<title>video-SALMONN S: Streaming Audio-Visual LLMs Beyond Length Limits via Memory</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces (i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging, and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro), video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with 10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and 67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming baselines.

Abstract: Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images, using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in reproductive medicine by enabling real-time sperm selection based on DNA integrity for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

<title>Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion for PolSAR Image Classification</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them. However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture. Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text, which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation. Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation. Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information. However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 5.2\%-14.1\%.

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models, which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer (e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale) across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding. We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset, BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16 regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant (Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000 multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation. BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge; models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of T5 models for Saudi Sign Language (SSL) translation using a novel dataset. The SSL dataset includes three challenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across different scenarios. Additionally, it captures unique SSL characteristics, such as face coverings, which pose challenges for sign recognition and translation. In our experiments, we investigate the impact of pre-training on American Sign Language (ASL) data by comparing T5 models pre-trained on the YouTubeASL dataset with models trained directly on the SSL dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improves models' performance (roughly $3\times$ in BLEU-4), indicating cross-linguistic transferability in sign language models. Our findings highlight the benefits of leveraging large-scale ASL data to improve SSL translation and provide insights into the development of more effective sign language translation systems. Our code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation. Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC), a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors, whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks. Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/ylhz/FlexAC.

<title>Class Prototypes based Contrastive Learning for Classifying Multi-Label and Fine-Grained Educational Videos</title>

Abstract: The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names' vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation, we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at https://github.com/rohit-gupta/MMContrast/tree/main/APPROVE

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics, extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications for social perception and clinical assessment.

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient, lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images. Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942, precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives. Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Sign languages serve as essential communication systems for individuals with hearing and speech impairments. However, digital linguistic dataset resources for underrepresented sign languages, such as Nepali Sign Language (NSL), remain scarce. This study introduces the first benchmark dataset for NSL, consisting of 36 gesture classes with 1,500 samples per class, designed to capture the structural and visual features of the language. To evaluate recognition performance, we fine-tuned MobileNetV2 and ResNet50 architectures on the dataset, achieving classification accuracies of 90.45% and 88.78%, respectively. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in sign recognition tasks, particularly within low-resource settings. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic effort to construct a benchmark dataset and assess deep learning approaches for NSL recognition, highlighting the potential of transfer learning and fine-tuning for advancing research in underexplored sign languages.

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG) modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show our framework achieves superior segmentation accuracy and better generalization across various clinical settings. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/LWX-Research/DTEA}{https://github.com/LWX-Research/DTEA}.

<title>A Large-Language-Model Assisted Automated Scale Bar Detection and Extraction Framework for Scanning Electron Microscopic Images</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG) model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii) information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

<title>Exploring and Leveraging Class Vectors for Classifier Editing</title>

arXiv:2510.11268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and adversarial trigger optimization.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring but is challenged by complex factors like ambiguous edges and background noise. We introduce EEMS, a new model for segmentation, combining an Edge-Aware Enhancement Unit (EAEU) and a Multi-scale Prompt Generation Unit (MSPGU). EAEU enhances edge perception via multi-frequency feature extraction, accurately defining boundaries. MSPGU integrates high-level semantic and low-level spatial features using a prompt-guided approach, ensuring precise target localization. The Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion Unit (DAGFU) merges edge features from EAEU with semantic features from MSPGU, enhancing segmentation accuracy and robustness. Tests on datasets like ISIC2018 confirm EEMS's superior performance and reliability as a clinical tool.

<title>Human Uncertainty-Aware Data Selection and Automatic Labeling in Visual Question Answering</title>

arXiv:2510.11295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially, real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

<title>$\Delta \mathrm{Energy}$: Optimizing Energy Change During Vision-Language Alignment Improves both OOD Detection and OOD Generalization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11296</link>

arXiv:2510.11296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian, which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by 10% to 25% in AUROC.

<title>When Does Supervised Training Pay Off? The Hidden Economics of Object Detection in the Era of Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on 1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2% accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for 100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond 55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year. Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories (ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance metrics.

Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic bridging and symmetry-aware design.

Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River (France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers. Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step and the hyperparameters of the methods.

Abstract: Interactive 3D scenes are increasingly vital for embodied intelligence, yet existing datasets remain limited due to the labor-intensive process of annotating part segmentation, kinematic types, and motion trajectories. We present REACT3D, a scalable zero-shot framework that converts static 3D scenes into simulation-ready interactive replicas with consistent geometry, enabling direct use in diverse downstream tasks. Our contributions include: (i) openable-object detection and segmentation to extract candidate movable parts from static scenes, (ii) articulation estimation that infers joint types and motion parameters, (iii) hidden-geometry completion followed by interactive object assembly, and (iv) interactive scene integration in widely supported formats to ensure compatibility with standard simulation platforms. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on detection/segmentation and articulation metrics across diverse indoor scenes, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework and providing a practical foundation for scalable interactive scene generation, thereby lowering the barrier to large-scale research on articulated scene understanding.

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance. Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary counterparts.

<title>MMAP: A Multi-Magnification and Prototype-Aware Architecture for Predicting Spatial Gene Expression</title>

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use of hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals. Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and (2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC).

<title>Uncertainty-Aware ControlNet: Bridging Domain Gaps with Synthetic Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene experiment.

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters and inference time.

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering (PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling, resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end, we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with 2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in novel views synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high- and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively, and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6 and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7% win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward producing human-preferred documents.

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects. Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features (i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/juneyeeHu/LM-EEC.

<title>Enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness on Inland Waterways: A YOLO-Based Fusion of Satellite and AIS for Vessel Characterization</title>

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550 instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification (tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1 score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1 score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded 93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets, incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further enhance operational scalability.

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques. This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression. Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor (SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment. In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Abstract: In recent years, while cloud-based MLLMs such as QwenVL, InternVL, GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude Sonnet have demonstrated outstanding performance with enormous model sizes reaching hundreds of billions of parameters, they significantly surpass the limitations in memory, power consumption, and computing capacity of edge devices such as mobile phones. This paper introduces AndesVL, a suite of mobile-side MLLMs with 0.6B to 4B parameters based on Qwen3's LLM and various visual encoders. We comprehensively outline the model architectures, training pipeline, and training data of AndesVL, which achieves first-tier performance across a wide range of open-source benchmarks, including fields such as text-rich image understanding, reasoning and math, multi-image comprehension, general VQA, hallucination mitigation, multilingual understanding, and GUI-related tasks when compared with state-of-the-art models of a similar scale.

<title>Towards Fast and Scalable Normal Integration using Continuous Components</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision, dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

arXiv:2510.11509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages 11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled, scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities. Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users. Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing multi-modal walking assistance.

<title>Massive Activations are the Key to Local Detail Synthesis in Diffusion Transformers</title>

arXiv:2510.11538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations} (MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail \textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10 fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20 representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

Abstract: Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50 baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential samples for targeted performance.

arXiv:2510.11565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts). Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer, resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in \textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries, enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5 text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for scalable 3D annotation.

<title>A Framework for Low-Effort Training Data Generation for Urban Semantic Segmentation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.11567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation, object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance. Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for urban scene understanding.

Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth observation, but their potential for hyperspectral crop mapping remains underexplored. This study benchmarks three foundation models for cereal crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery: HyperSigma, DOFA, and Vision Transformers pre-trained on the SpectralEarth dataset (a large multitemporal hyperspectral archive). Models were fine-tuned on manually labeled data from a training region and evaluated on an independent test region. Performance was measured with overall accuracy (OA), average accuracy (AA), and F1-score. HyperSigma achieved an OA of 34.5% (+/- 1.8%), DOFA reached 62.6% (+/- 3.5%), and the SpectralEarth model achieved an OA of 93.5% (+/- 0.8%). A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch achieved 91%, highlighting the importance of model architecture for strong generalization across geographic regions and sensor platforms. These results provide a systematic evaluation of foundation models for operational hyperspectral crop mapping and outline directions for future model development.

<title>MS-Mix: Unveiling the Power of Mixup for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</title>

arXiv:2510.11579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS) strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment augmentation.

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However, their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work, especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process: (1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19 leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes. Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

<title>High-resolution Photo Enhancement in Real-time: A Laplacian Pyramid Network</title>

Abstract: Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

<title>NV3D: Leveraging Spatial Shape Through Normal Vector-based 3D Object Detection</title>

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18% mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61% and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of voxels being filtered out.

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity, narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity, integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

Abstract: Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a single image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D scene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity, occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges, we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting, fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only 9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end. It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm, and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding. Our implementation is publicly available at https://yuxuan-xue.com/physic.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is a long-standing challenge, particularly when covering broad attribute ranges such as ethnicity, age, clothing styles, and detailed body shapes. Capturing and annotating large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a practical and affordable solution. We will publicly release the automatic data generation pipeline, the comprehensive InfiniHumanData dataset, and the InfiniHumanGen models at https://yuxuan-xue.com/infini-human.

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process, thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE (Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning, enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet, COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

<title>Beyond 'Templates': Category-Agnostic Object Pose, Size, and Shape Estimation from a Single View</title>

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL, spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D understanding in robotics and embodied AI.

<title>Diffusion Transformers with Representation Autoencoders</title>

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders (e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty, propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer training.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically, it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs, Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for more efficient and robust image classification.

Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality, real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is available at https://github.com/Insta360-Research-Team/DiT360.

Abstract: Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only. This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS, i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images) from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage: https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/Ev4DGS/.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance, such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems. Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples. Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at https://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent. Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and few-shot fine-tuning.

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work, we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings, allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor inductive bias in DPMs.

However, they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing, dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt, depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer vision, scientific computing, and dynamical systems, significantly advancing these disciplines. However, neural Networks persistently face challenges related to theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization. To address these issues, researchers are increasingly adopting a differential equations perspective to propose a unified theoretical framework and systematic design methodologies for neural networks. In this paper, we provide an extensive review of deep neural network architectures and dynamic modeling methods inspired by differential equations. We specifically examine deep neural network models and deterministic dynamical network constructs based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), as well as regularization techniques and stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We present numerical comparisons of these models to illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Automated resume information extraction is critical for scaling talent acquisition, yet its real-world deployment faces three major challenges: the extreme heterogeneity of resume layouts and content, the high cost and latency of large language models (LLMs), and the lack of standardized datasets and evaluation tools. In this work, we present a layout-aware and efficiency-optimized framework for automated extraction and evaluation that addresses all three challenges. Our system combines a fine-tuned layout parser to normalize diverse document formats, an inference-efficient LLM extractor based on parallel prompting and instruction tuning, and a robust two-stage automated evaluation framework supported by new benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate that a fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves top-tier accuracy while significantly reducing inference latency and computational cost. The system is fully deployed in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across its business units.

Abstract: Visual retrieval-augmented generation (VRAG) augments vision-language models (VLMs) with external visual knowledge to ground reasoning and reduce hallucinations. Yet current VRAG systems often fail to reliably perceive and integrate evidence across multiple images, leading to weak grounding and erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we propose EVisRAG, an end-to-end framework that learns to reason with evidence-guided multi-image to address this issue. The model first observes retrieved images and records per-image evidence, then derives the final answer from the aggregated evidence. To train EVisRAG effectively, we introduce Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy Optimization (RS-GRPO), which binds fine-grained rewards to scope-specific tokens to jointly optimize visual perception and reasoning abilities of VLMs. Experimental results on multiple visual question answering benchmarks demonstrate that EVisRAG delivers substantial end-to-end gains over backbone VLM with 27\% improvements on average. Further analysis shows that, powered by RS-GRPO, EVisRAG improves answer accuracy by precisely perceiving and localizing question-relevant evidence across multiple images and deriving the final answer from that evidence, much like a real detective.

<title>Reliable Active Learning from Unreliable Labels via Neural Collapse Geometry</title>

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty, diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts, a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines. Our code is available at https://github.com/Vision-IIITD/NCAL.

<title>Causality $\neq$ Decodability, and Vice Versa: Lessons from Interpreting Counting ViTs</title>

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational circuits.

Abstract: Today's visuo-tactile sensors come in many shapes and sizes, making it challenging to develop general-purpose tactile representations. This is because most models are tied to a specific sensor design. To address this challenge, we propose two approaches to cross-sensor image generation. The first is an end-to-end method that leverages paired data (Touch2Touch). The second method builds an intermediate depth representation and does not require paired data (T2D2: Touch-to-Depth-to-Touch). Both methods enable the use of sensor-specific models across multiple sensors via the cross-sensor touch generation process. Together, these models offer flexible solutions for sensor translation, depending on data availability and application needs. We demonstrate their effectiveness on downstream tasks such as in-hand pose estimation and behavior cloning, successfully transferring models trained on one sensor to another.

arXiv:2510.09825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

<title>MTMD: A Multi-Task Multi-Domain Framework for Unified Ad Lightweight Ranking at Pinterest</title>

Abstract: The lightweight ad ranking layer, living after the retrieval stage and before the fine ranker, plays a critical role in the success of a cascaded ad recommendation system. Due to the fact that there are multiple optimization tasks depending on the ad domain, e.g., Click Through Rate (CTR) for click ads and Conversion Rate (CVR) for conversion ads, as well as multiple surfaces where an ad is served (home feed, search, or related item recommendation) with diverse ad products (shopping or standard ad); it is an essentially challenging problem in industry on how to do joint holistic optimization in the lightweight ranker, such that the overall platform's value, advertiser's value, and user's value are maximized.
  Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based multitask learning (MTL) can handle multiple goals naturally, with each prediction head mapping to a particular optimization goal. However, in practice, it is unclear how to unify data from different surfaces and ad products into a single model. It is critical to learn domain-specialized knowledge and explicitly transfer knowledge between domains to make MTL effective. We present a Multi-Task Multi-Domain (MTMD) architecture under the classic Two-Tower paradigm, with the following key contributions: 1) handle different prediction tasks, ad products, and ad serving surfaces in a unified framework; 2) propose a novel mixture-of-expert architecture to learn both specialized knowledge each domain and common knowledge shared between domains; 3) propose a domain adaption module to encourage knowledge transfer between experts; 4) constrain the modeling of different prediction tasks. MTMD improves the offline loss value by 12% to 36%, mapping to 2% online reduction in cost per click. We have deployed this single MTMD framework into production for Pinterest ad recommendation replacing 9 production models.

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is widely recognized as essential for neural compression, yet balancing the rate-distortion-perception tradeoff remains challenging. This difficulty is especially pronounced in video compression, where frame-wise quality fluctuations often cause perceptually optimized neural video codecs to suffer from flickering artifacts. In this paper, inspired by the success of latent generative models, we present Generative Latent Video Compression (GLVC), an effective framework for perceptual video compression. GLVC employs a pretrained continuous tokenizer to project video frames into a perceptually aligned latent space, thereby offloading perceptual constraints from the rate-distortion optimization. We redesign the codec architecture explicitly for the latent domain, drawing on extensive insights from prior neural video codecs, and further equip it with innovations such as unified intra/inter coding and a recurrent memory mechanism. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks show that GLVC achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of DISTS and LPIPS metrics. Notably, our user study confirms GLVC rivals the latest neural video codecs at nearly half their rate while maintaining stable temporal coherence, marking a step toward practical perceptual video compression.

<title>CLoD-GS: Continuous Level-of-Detail via 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: Level of Detail (LoD) is a fundamental technique in real-time computer graphics for managing the rendering costs of complex scenes while preserving visual fidelity. Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels (DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at different distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two major drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and causes jarring visual ``popping" artifacts during transitions, degrading the user experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm: Continuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality scaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems of DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a continuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method introduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian primitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity. This allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant primitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one model. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a virtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy with rendered point count regularization. Our approach not only eliminates the storage overhead and visual artifacts of discrete methods but also reduces the primitive count and memory footprint of the final model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLoD-GS achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from a single model, delivering high-fidelity results across a wide range of performance targets.

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words) to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively. Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast, convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper, we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named {\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution) achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at https://github.com/hehefan/Translution.

Abstract: Large vision-language model (LVLM)-based web agents are emerging as powerful tools for automating complex online tasks. However, when deployed in real-world environments, they face serious security risks, motivating the design of security evaluation benchmarks. Existing benchmarks provide only partial coverage, typically restricted to narrow scenarios such as user-level prompt manipulation, and thus fail to capture the broad range of agent vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we present \tool{}, the first holistic benchmark for evaluating the security of LVLM-based web agents. \tool{} first introduces a unified evaluation suite comprising six simulated but realistic web environments (\eg, e-commerce platforms, community forums) and includes 2,970 high-quality trajectories spanning diverse tasks and attack settings. The suite defines a structured taxonomy of six attack vectors spanning both user-level and environment-level manipulations. In addition, we introduce a multi-layered evaluation protocol that analyzes agent failures across three critical dimensions: internal reasoning, behavioral trajectory, and task outcome, facilitating a fine-grained risk analysis that goes far beyond simple success metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct large-scale experiments on 9 representative LVLMs, which fall into three categories: general-purpose, agent-specialized, and GUI-grounded. Our results show that all tested agents are consistently vulnerable to subtle adversarial manipulations and reveal critical trade-offs between model specialization and security. By providing (1) a comprehensive benchmark suite with diverse environments and a multi-layered evaluation pipeline, and (2) empirical insights into the security challenges of modern LVLM-based web agents, \tool{} establishes a foundation for advancing trustworthy web agent deployment.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of robust, in-the-wild imaging using ultra-thin nanophotonic metalens cameras. Meta-lenses, composed of planar arrays of nanoscale scatterers, promise dramatic reductions in size and weight compared to conventional refractive optics. However, severe chromatic aberration, pronounced light scattering, narrow spectral bandwidth, and low light efficiency continue to limit their practical adoption. In this work, we present an end-to-end solution for in-the-wild imaging that pairs a metalens several times thinner than conventional optics with a bespoke multi-image restoration framework optimized for practical metalens cameras. Our method centers on a lightweight convolutional network paired with a memory-efficient burst fusion algorithm that adaptively corrects noise, saturation clipping, and lens-induced distortions across rapid sequences of extremely degraded metalens captures. Extensive experiments on diverse, real-world handheld captures demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing burst-mode and single-image restoration techniques.These results point toward a practical route for deploying metalens-based cameras in everyday imaging applications.

Abstract: Embodied agents face a fundamental limitation: once deployed in real-world environments to perform specific tasks, they are unable to acquire new useful knowledge to enhance task performance. In this paper, we propose a general post-deployment learning framework called Dejavu, which employs an Experience Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN automatically identifies contextually successful prior action experiences and conditions action prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with semantic similarity rewards on EFN to ensure that the predicted actions align with past successful behaviors under current observations. During deployment, EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent to exhibit "learning from experience" despite fixed weights. Experiments across diverse embodied tasks show that EFN significantly improves adaptability, robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. These results highlight a promising path toward embodied agents that continually refine their behavior after deployment.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have gained success in various signal processing tasks due to their advantages of continuity and infinite resolution. However, the factors influencing their effectiveness and limitations remain underexplored. To better understand these factors, we leverage insights from Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to analyze how model architectures (classic MLP and emerging KAN), positional encoding, and nonlinear primitives affect the response to signals of varying frequencies. Building on this analysis, we introduce INR-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for multimodal INR tasks. It includes 56 variants of Coordinate-MLP models (featuring 4 types of positional encoding and 14 activation functions) and 22 Coordinate-KAN models with distinct basis functions, evaluated across 9 implicit multimodal tasks. These tasks cover both forward and inverse problems, offering a robust platform to highlight the strengths and limitations of different neural models, thereby establishing a solid foundation for future research. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/lif314/INR-Bench.

Abstract: Successful generalist Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on effective training across diverse robotic platforms with large-scale, cross-embodiment, heterogeneous datasets. To facilitate and leverage the heterogeneity in rich, diverse robotic data sources, we propose a novel Soft Prompt approach with minimally added parameters, by infusing prompt learning concepts into cross-embodiment robot learning and introducing separate sets of learnable embeddings for each distinct data source. These embeddings serve as embodiment-specific prompts, which in unity empower VLA models with effective exploitation of varying cross-embodiment features. Our new X-VLA, a neat flow-matching-based VLA architecture, relies exclusively on soft-prompted standard Transformer encoders, enjoying both scalability and simplicity. Evaluated across 6 simulations as well as 3 real-world robots, our 0.9B instantiation-X-VLA-0.9B simultaneously achieves SOTA performance over a sweep of benchmarks, demonstrating superior results on a wide axes of capabilities, from flexible dexterity to quick adaptation across embodiments, environments, and tasks.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into computer applications has introduced transformative capabilities but also significant security challenges. Existing safety alignments, which primarily focus on semantic interpretation, leave LLMs vulnerable to attacks that use non-standard data representations. This paper introduces ArtPerception, a novel black-box jailbreak framework that strategically leverages ASCII art to bypass the security measures of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. Unlike prior methods that rely on iterative, brute-force attacks, ArtPerception introduces a systematic, two-phase methodology. Phase 1 conducts a one-time, model-specific pre-test to empirically determine the optimal parameters for ASCII art recognition. Phase 2 leverages these insights to launch a highly efficient, one-shot malicious jailbreak attack. We propose a Modified Levenshtein Distance (MLD) metric for a more nuanced evaluation of an LLM's recognition capability. Through comprehensive experiments on four SOTA open-source LLMs, we demonstrate superior jailbreak performance. We further validate our framework's real-world relevance by showing its successful transferability to leading commercial models, including GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and DeepSeek-V3, and by conducting a rigorous effectiveness analysis against potential defenses such as LLaMA Guard and Azure's content filters. Our findings underscore that true LLM security requires defending against a multi-modal space of interpretations, even within text-only inputs, and highlight the effectiveness of strategic, reconnaissance-based attacks. Content Warning: This paper includes potentially harmful and offensive model outputs.

Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient 3D avatar coding framework that leverages compact human priors and canonical-to-target transformation to enable high-quality 3D human avatar video compression at ultra-low bit rates. The framework begins by training a canonical Gaussian avatar using articulated splatting in a network-free manner, which serves as the foundation for avatar appearance modeling. Simultaneously, a human-prior template is employed to capture temporal body movements through compact parametric representations. This decomposition of appearance and temporal evolution minimizes redundancy, enabling efficient compression: the canonical avatar is shared across the sequence, requiring compression only once, while the temporal parameters, consisting of just 94 parameters per frame, are transmitted with minimal bit-rate. For each frame, the target human avatar is generated by deforming canonical avatar via Linear Blend Skinning transformation, facilitating temporal coherent video reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms conventional 2D/3D codecs and existing learnable dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting compression method in terms of rate-distortion performance on mainstream multi-view human video datasets, paving the way for seamless immersive multimedia experiences in meta-verse applications.

Abstract: Efficient exploration and mapping in unknown indoor environments is a fundamental challenge, with high stakes in time-critical settings. In current systems, robot perception remains confined to line-of-sight; occluded regions remain unknown until physically traversed, leading to inefficient exploration when layouts deviate from prior assumptions. In this work, we bring non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing to robotic exploration. We leverage single-photon LiDARs, which capture time-of-flight histograms that encode the presence of hidden objects - allowing robots to look around blind corners. Recent single-photon LiDARs have become practical and portable, enabling deployment beyond controlled lab settings. Prior NLOS works target 3D reconstruction in static, lab-based scenarios, and initial efforts toward NLOS-aided navigation consider simplified geometries. We introduce SuperEx, a framework that integrates NLOS sensing directly into the mapping-exploration loop. SuperEx augments global map prediction with beyond-line-of-sight cues by (i) carving empty NLOS regions from timing histograms and (ii) reconstructing occupied structure via a two-step physics-based and data-driven approach that leverages structural regularities. Evaluations on complex simulated maps and the real-world KTH Floorplan dataset show a 12% gain in mapping accuracy under < 30% coverage and improved exploration efficiency compared to line-of-sight baselines, opening a path to reliable mapping beyond direct visibility.

Abstract: Cross-attention transformers and other multimodal vision-language models excel at grounding and generation; however, their extensive, full-precision backbones make it challenging to deploy them on edge devices. Memory-augmented architectures enhance the utilization of past context; however, most works rarely pair them with aggressive edge-oriented quantization. We introduce BitMar, a quantized multimodal transformer that proposes an external human-like episodic memory for effective image-text generation on hardware with limited resources. BitMar utilizes 1.58-bit encoders, one for text (BitNet-style) and one for vision (DiNOv2-based), to create compact embeddings that are combined and used to query a fixed-size key-value episodic memory. During vector retrieval, the BitNet decoder applies per-layer conditioning, which increases the contextual relevance of generated content. The decoder also employs attention sinks with a sliding-window mechanism to process long or streaming inputs under tight memory budgets. The combination of per-layer conditioning and sliding-window attention achieves a strong quality-speed trade-off, delivering competitive captioning and multimodal understanding at low latency with a small model footprint. These characteristics make BitMar well-suited for edge deployment.

Abstract: Most robotic grasping systems rely on converting sensor data into explicit 3D point clouds, which is a computational step not found in biological intelligence. This paper explores a fundamentally different, neuro-inspired paradigm for 6-DoF grasp detection. We introduce SpikeGrasp, a framework that mimics the biological visuomotor pathway, processing raw, asynchronous events from stereo spike cameras, similarly to retinas, to directly infer grasp poses. Our model fuses these stereo spike streams and uses a recurrent spiking neural network, analogous to high-level visual processing, to iteratively refine grasp hypotheses without ever reconstructing a point cloud. To validate this approach, we built a large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset. Experiments show that SpikeGrasp surpasses traditional point-cloud-based baselines, especially in cluttered and textureless scenes, and demonstrates remarkable data efficiency. By establishing the viability of this end-to-end, neuro-inspired approach, SpikeGrasp paves the way for future systems capable of the fluid and efficient manipulation seen in nature, particularly for dynamic objects.

Abstract: Traditional ultrasound simulation methods solve wave equations numerically, achieving high accuracy but at substantial computational cost. Faster alternatives based on convolution with precomputed impulse responses remain relatively slow, often requiring several minutes to generate a full B-mode image. We introduce UltraScatter, a probabilistic ray tracing framework that models ultrasound scattering efficiently and realistically. Tissue is represented as a volumetric field of scattering probability and scattering amplitude, and ray interactions are simulated via free-flight delta tracking. Scattered rays are traced to the transducer, with phase information incorporated through a linear time-of-flight model. Integrated with plane-wave imaging and beamforming, our parallelized ray tracing architecture produces B-mode images within seconds. Validation with phantom data shows realistic speckle and inclusion patterns, positioning UltraScatter as a scalable alternative to wave-based methods.

<title>ImpMIA: Leveraging Implicit Bias for Membership Inference Attack under Realistic Scenarios</title>

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples. This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

Abstract: Just Noticeable Distortion (JND)-guided pre-filter is a promising technique for improving the perceptual compression efficiency of image coding. However, existing methods are often computationally expensive, and the field lacks standardized benchmarks for fair comparison. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a twofold contribution. First, we develop and open-source FJNDF-Pytorch, a unified benchmark for frequency-domain JND-Guided pre-filters. Second, leveraging this platform, we propose a complete learning framework for a novel, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art compression efficiency, consistently outperforming competitors across multiple datasets and encoders. In terms of computational cost, our model is exceptionally lightweight, requiring only 7.15 GFLOPs to process a 1080p image, which is merely 14.1% of the cost of recent lightweight network. Our work presents a robust, state-of-the-art solution that excels in both performance and efficiency, supported by a reproducible research platform. The open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/viplab-fudan/FJNDF-Pytorch.

Abstract: Creative generation is the synthesis of new, surprising, and valuable samples that reflect user intent yet cannot be envisioned in advance. This task aims to extend human imagination, enabling the discovery of visual concepts that exist in the unexplored spaces between familiar domains. While text-to-image diffusion models excel at rendering photorealistic scenes that faithfully match user prompts, they still struggle to generate genuinely novel content. Existing approaches to enhance generative creativity either rely on interpolation of image features, which restricts exploration to predefined categories, or require time-intensive procedures such as embedding optimization or model fine-tuning. We propose VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative-Prompting, a training-free, inference-time method that promotes creative image generation while preserving the validity of the generated object. Our approach utilizes a vision-language model (VLM) that analyzes intermediate outputs of the generation process and adaptively steers it away from conventional visual concepts, encouraging the emergence of novel and surprising outputs. We evaluate creativity through both novelty and validity, using statistical metrics in the CLIP embedding space. Through extensive experiments, we show consistent gains in creative novelty with negligible computational overhead. Moreover, unlike existing methods that primarily generate single objects, our approach extends to complex scenarios, such as generating coherent sets of creative objects and preserving creativity within elaborate compositional prompts. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion pipelines, offering a practical route to producing creative outputs that venture beyond the constraints of textual descriptions.

<title>Optimally Deep Networks -- Adapting Model Depth to Datasets for Superior Efficiency</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical. To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

Abstract: The capacity to predict human spatial preferences within built environments is instrumental for developing Cyber-Physical-Social Infrastructure Systems (CPSIS). A significant challenge in this domain is the generalizability of preference models, particularly their efficacy in predicting preferences within environmental configurations not encountered during training. While deep learning models have shown promise in learning complex spatial and contextual dependencies, it remains unclear which neural network architectures are most effective at generalizing to unseen layouts. To address this, we conduct a comparative study of Graph Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and standard feedforward Neural Networks using synthetic data generated from a simplified and synthetic pocket park environment. Beginning with this illustrative case study, allows for controlled analysis of each model's ability to transfer learned preference patterns to unseen spatial scenarios. The models are evaluated based on their capacity to predict preferences influenced by heterogeneous physical, environmental, and social features. Generalizability score is calculated using the area under the precision-recall curve for the seen and unseen layouts. This generalizability score is appropriate for imbalanced data, providing insights into the suitability of each neural network architecture for preference-aware human behavior modeling in unseen built environments.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$) by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

Abstract: Priors are vital for planning under partial observability, yet difficult to obtain in practice. We present a sampling-based pipeline that leverages large-scale pretrained generative models to produce probabilistic priors capturing environmental uncertainty and spatio-semantic relationships in a zero-shot manner. Conditioned on partial observations, the pipeline recovers complete RGB-D point cloud samples with occupancy and target semantics, formulated to be directly useful in configuration-space planning. We establish a Matterport3D benchmark of rooms partially visible through doorways, where a robot must navigate to an unobserved target object. Effective priors for this setting must represent both occupancy and target-location uncertainty in unobserved regions. Experiments show that our approach recovers commonsense spatial semantics consistent with ground truth, yielding diverse, clean 3D point clouds usable in motion planning, highlight the promise of generative models as a rich source of priors for robotic planning.

Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its \textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm (AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN) are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary. Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\% and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

<title>Lightweight Facial Landmark Detection in Thermal Images via Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Transfer</title>

Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while drastically reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Deep learning is expected to aid pathologists by automating tasks such as tumour segmentation. We aimed to develop one universal tumour segmentation model for histopathological images and examine its performance in different cancer types. The model was developed using over 20 000 whole-slide images from over 4 000 patients with colorectal, endometrial, lung, or prostate carcinoma. Performance was validated in pre-planned analyses on external cohorts with over 3 000 patients across six cancer types. Exploratory analyses included over 1 500 additional patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Average Dice coefficient was over 80% in all validation cohorts with en bloc resection specimens and in The Cancer Genome Atlas cohorts. No loss of performance was observed when comparing the universal model with models specialised on single cancer types. In conclusion, extensive and rigorous evaluations demonstrate that generic tumour segmentation by a single model is possible across cancer types, patient populations, sample preparations, and slide scanners.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution, and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes, with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone ($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows that answer accuracy and explanation quality are decoupled, acknowledging injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy, proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to evaluate beyond final answer accuracy.

Abstract: Scooping items with tools such as spoons and ladles is common in daily life, ranging from assistive feeding to retrieving items from environmental disaster sites. However, developing a general and autonomous robotic scooping policy is challenging since it requires reasoning about complex tool-object interactions. Furthermore, scooping often involves manipulating deformable objects, such as granular media or liquids, which is challenging due to their infinite-dimensional configuration spaces and complex dynamics. We propose a method, SCOOP'D, which uses simulation from OmniGibson (built on NVIDIA Omniverse) to collect scooping demonstrations using algorithmic procedures that rely on privileged state information. Then, we use generative policies via diffusion to imitate demonstrations from observational input. We directly apply the learned policy in diverse real-world scenarios, testing its performance on various item quantities, item characteristics, and container types. In zero-shot deployment, our method demonstrates promising results across 465 trials in diverse scenarios, including objects of different difficulty levels that we categorize as "Level 1" and "Level 2." SCOOP'D outperforms all baselines and ablations, suggesting that this is a promising approach to acquiring robotic scooping skills. Project page is at https://scoopdiff.github.io/.

Abstract: Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities. Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL), showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at https://github.com/LCO-Embedding/LCO-Embedding.

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4 quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism, which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training in LLMs.

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks. Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning process or non-robust inputs.

<title>Invariant Feature Learning for Generalized Long-Tailed Classification</title>

Abstract: Existing long-tailed classification (LT) methods only focus on tackling the class-wise imbalance that head classes have more samples than tail classes, but overlook the attribute-wise imbalance. In fact, even if the class is balanced, samples within each class may still be long-tailed due to the varying attributes. Note that the latter is fundamentally more ubiquitous and challenging than the former because attributes are not just implicit for most datasets, but also combinatorially complex, thus prohibitively expensive to be balanced. Therefore, we introduce a novel research problem: Generalized Long-Tailed classification (GLT), to jointly consider both kinds of imbalances. By "generalized", we mean that a GLT method should naturally solve the traditional LT, but not vice versa. Not surprisingly, we find that most class-wise LT methods degenerate in our proposed two benchmarks: ImageNet-GLT and MSCOCO-GLT. We argue that it is because they over-emphasize the adjustment of class distribution while neglecting to learn attribute-invariant features. To this end, we propose an Invariant Feature Learning (IFL) method as the first strong baseline for GLT. IFL first discovers environments with divergent intra-class distributions from the imperfect predictions and then learns invariant features across them. Promisingly, as an improved feature backbone, IFL boosts all the LT line-up: one/two-stage re-balance, augmentation, and ensemble. Codes and benchmarks are available on Github: https://github.com/KaihuaTang/Generalized-Long-Tailed-Benchmarks.pytorch

<title>Class Is Invariant to Context and Vice Versa: On Learning Invariance for Out-Of-Distribution Generalization</title>

Abstract: Out-Of-Distribution generalization (OOD) is all about learning invariance against environmental changes. If the context in every class is evenly distributed, OOD would be trivial because the context can be easily removed due to an underlying principle: class is invariant to context. However, collecting such a balanced dataset is impractical. Learning on imbalanced data makes the model bias to context and thus hurts OOD. Therefore, the key to OOD is context balance. We argue that the widely adopted assumption in prior work, the context bias can be directly annotated or estimated from biased class prediction, renders the context incomplete or even incorrect. In contrast, we point out the everoverlooked other side of the above principle: context is also invariant to class, which motivates us to consider the classes (which are already labeled) as the varying environments to resolve context bias (without context labels). We implement this idea by minimizing the contrastive loss of intra-class sample similarity while assuring this similarity to be invariant across all classes. On benchmarks with various context biases and domain gaps, we show that a simple re-weighting based classifier equipped with our context estimation achieves state-of-the-art performance. We provide the theoretical justifications in Appendix and codes on https://github.com/simpleshinobu/IRMCon.

Abstract: We introduce \emph{Information Topology}: a framework that unifies information theory and algebraic topology by treating \emph{cycle closure} as the primitive operation of inference. The starting point is the \emph{dot-cycle dichotomy}, which separates pointwise, order-sensitive fluctuations (dots) from order-invariant, predictive structure (cycles). Algebraically, closure is the cancellation of boundaries ($\partial^2=0$), which converts transient histories into stable invariants. Building on this, we derive the \emph{Structure-Before-Specificity} (SbS) principle: stable information resides in nontrivial homology classes that persist under perturbations, while high-entropy contextual details act as scaffolds. The \emph{Context-Content Uncertainty Principle} (CCUP) quantifies this balance by decomposing uncertainty into contextual spread and content precision, showing why prediction requires invariance for generalization. Measure concentration onto residual invariant manifolds explains \emph{order invariance}: when mass collapses to a narrow tube around a closed cycle, reparameterizations of micro-steps leave predictive functionals unchanged. We then define \emph{homological capacity}, the topological dual of Shannon capacity, as the sustainable number of independent informational cycles supported by a system. This capacity links dynamical (KS) entropy to structural (homological) capacity and refines Euler characteristics from a ``net'' summary to a ``gross'' count of persistent invariants. Finally, we illustrate the theory across three domains where \emph{more is different}: \textbf{visual binding}, \textbf{working memory}, and \textbf{access consciousness}. Together, these results recast inference, learning, and communication as \emph{topological stabilization}: the formation, closure, and persistence of informational cycles that make prediction robust and scalable.

Abstract: Camouflaged objects that blend into natural scenes pose significant challenges for deep-learning models to detect and synthesize. While camouflaged object detection is a crucial task in computer vision with diverse real-world applications, this research topic has been constrained by limited data availability. We propose a framework for synthesizing camouflage data to enhance the detection of camouflaged objects in natural scenes. Our approach employs a generative model to produce realistic camouflage images, which can be used to train existing object detection models. Specifically, we use a camouflage environment generator supervised by a camouflage distribution classifier to synthesize the camouflage images, which are then fed into our generator to expand the dataset. Our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art method on three datasets (COD10k, CAMO, and CHAMELEON), demonstrating its effectiveness in improving camouflaged object detection. This approach can serve as a plug-and-play data generation and augmentation module for existing camouflaged object detection tasks and provides a novel way to introduce more diversity and distributions into current camouflage datasets.

Abstract: Predicting crowd intentions and trajectories is critical for a range of real-world applications, involving social robotics and autonomous driving. Accurately modeling such behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of pairwise spatial-temporal interactions and the heterogeneous influence of groupwise dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. Hyper-STTN constructs multiscale hypergraphs of varying group sizes to model groupwise correlations, captured through spectral hypergraph convolution based on random-walk probabilities. In parallel, a spatial-temporal transformer is employed to learn pedestrians' pairwise latent interactions across spatial and temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous groupwise and pairwise features are subsequently fused and aligned via a multimodal transformer. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian motion datasets demonstrate that Hyper-STTN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models.

<title>MarkPlugger: Generalizable Watermark Framework for Latent Diffusion Models without Retraining</title>

Abstract: Today, the family of latent diffusion models (LDMs) has gained prominence for its high quality outputs and scalability. This has also raised security concerns on social media, as malicious users can create and disseminate harmful content. Existing approaches typically involve training specific components or entire generative models to embed a watermark in generated images for traceability and responsibility. However, in the fast-evolving era of AI-generated content (AIGC), the rapid iteration and modification of LDMs makes retraining with watermark models costly. To address the problem, we propose MarkPlugger, a generalizable plug-and-play watermark framework without LDM retraining. In particular, to reduce the disturbance of the watermark on the semantics of the generated image, we try to identify a watermark representation that is approaching orthogonal to the semantic in latent space, and apply an additive fusion strategy for the watermark and the semantic. Without modifying any components of the LDMs, we embed diverse watermarks in latent space, adapting to the denoising process. Our experimental findings reveal that our method effectively harmonizes image quality and watermark recovery rate. We also have validated that our method is generalized to multiple official versions and modified variants of LDMs, even without retraining the watermark model. Furthermore, it performs robustly under various attacks of different intensities.

Abstract: The construction of vectorized High-Definition (HD) maps from onboard surround-view cameras has become a significant focus in autonomous driving. However, current map vector estimation pipelines face two key limitations: input-agnostic queries struggle to capture complex map structures, and the view transformation leads to information loss. These issues often result in inaccurate shape restoration or missing instances in map predictions. To address this concern, we propose a novel approach, namely \textbf{PerCMap}, which explicitly exploits clues from perspective-view features at both instance and point level. Specifically, at instance level, we propose Cross-view Instance Activation (CIA) to activate instance queries across surround-view images, thereby helping the model recover the instance attributes of map vectors. At point level, we design Dual-view Point Embedding (DPE), which fuses features from both views to generate input-aware positional embeddings and improve the accuracy of point coordinate estimation. Extensive experiments on \textit{nuScenes} and \textit{Argoverse 2} demonstrate that PerCMap achieves strong and consistent performance across benchmarks, reaching 67.1 and 70.5 mAP, respectively.

Abstract: Semantic analysis on visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) images has gained significant attention due to their enhanced accuracy and robustness under challenging conditions including low-illumination and adverse weather. However, due to the lack of pre-trained foundation models on the large-scale infrared image datasets, existing methods prefer to design task-specific frameworks and directly fine-tune them with pre-trained foundation models on their RGB-IR semantic relevance datasets, which results in poor scalability and limited generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UniRGB-IR, a scalable and efficient framework for RGB-IR semantic tasks that introduces a novel adapter mechanism to effectively incorporate rich multi-modal features into pre-trained RGB-based foundation models. Our framework comprises three key components: a vision transformer (ViT) foundation model, a Multi-modal Feature Pool (MFP) module, and a Supplementary Feature Injector (SFI) module. The MFP and SFI modules cooperate with each other as an adpater to effectively complement the ViT features with the contextual multi-scale features. During training process, we freeze the entire foundation model to inherit prior knowledge and only optimize the MFP and SFI modules. Furthermore, to verify the effectiveness of our framework, we utilize the ViT-Base as the pre-trained foundation model to perform extensive experiments. Experimental results on various RGB-IR semantic tasks demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Denoising diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for image manipulation, yet interactive, localized editing workflows remain underdeveloped. We introduce Layered Diffusion Brushes (LDB), a novel training-free framework that enables interactive, layer-based editing using standard diffusion models. LDB defines each "layer" as a self-contained set of parameters guiding the generative process, enabling independent, non-destructive, and fine-grained prompt-guided edits, even in overlapping regions. LDB leverages a unique intermediate latent caching approach to reduce each edit to only a few denoising steps, achieving 140~ms per edit on consumer GPUs. An editor implementing LDB, incorporating familiar layer concepts, was evaluated via user study and quantitative metrics. Results demonstrate LDB's superior speed alongside comparable or improved image quality, background preservation, and edit fidelity relative to state-of-the-art methods across various sequential image manipulation tasks. The findings highlight LDB's ability to significantly enhance creative workflows by providing an intuitive and efficient approach to diffusion-based image editing and its potential for expansion into related subdomains, such as video editing.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality photorealistic images with textual descriptions as a condition is very challenging. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the classical model for this task, frequently suffer from low consistency between image and text descriptions and insufficient richness in synthesized images. Recently, conditional affine transformations (CAT), such as conditional batch normalization and instance normalization, have been applied to different layers of GAN to control content synthesis in images. CAT is a multi-layer perceptron that independently predicts data based on batch statistics between neighboring layers, with global textual information unavailable to other layers. To address this issue, we first model CAT and a recurrent neural network (RAT) to ensure that different layers can access global information. We then introduce shuffle attention between RAT to mitigate the characteristic of information forgetting in recurrent neural networks. Moreover, both our generator and discriminator utilize the powerful pre-trained model, Clip, which has been extensively employed for establishing associations between text and images through the learning of multimodal representations in latent space. The discriminator utilizes CLIP's ability to comprehend complex scenes to accurately assess the quality of the generated images. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the CUB, Oxford, and CelebA-tiny datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over current state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: When applying deep learning models in open-world scenarios, active learning (AL) strategies are crucial for identifying label candidates from a nearly infinite amount of unlabeled data. In this context, robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection mechanisms are essential for handling data outside the target distribution of the application. However, current works investigate both problems separately. In this work, we introduce SISOM as the first unified solution for both AL and OOD detection. By leveraging feature space distance metrics SISOM combines the strengths of the currently independent tasks to solve both effectively. We conduct extensive experiments showing the problems arising when migrating between both tasks. In these evaluations SISOM underlined its effectiveness by achieving first place in two of the widely used OpenOOD benchmarks and second place in the remaining one. In AL, SISOM outperforms others and delivers top-1 performance in three benchmarks

Abstract: Most video compression methods focus on human visual perception, neglecting semantic preservation. This leads to severe semantic loss during the compression, hampering downstream video analysis tasks. In this paper, we propose a Masked Video Modeling (MVM)-powered compression framework that particularly preserves video semantics, by jointly mining and compressing the semantics in a self-supervised manner. While MVM is proficient at learning generalizable semantics through the masked patch prediction task, it may also encode non-semantic information like trivial textural details, wasting bitcost and bringing semantic noises. To suppress this, we explicitly regularize the non-semantic entropy of the compressed video in the MVM token space. The proposed framework is instantiated as a simple Semantic-Mining-then-Compression (SMC) model. Furthermore, we extend SMC as an advanced SMC++ model from several aspects. First, we equip it with a masked motion prediction objective, leading to better temporal semantic learning ability. Second, we introduce a Transformer-based compression module, to improve the semantic compression efficacy. Considering that directly mining the complex redundancy among heterogeneous features in different coding stages is non-trivial, we introduce a compact blueprint semantic representation to align these features into a similar form, fully unleashing the power of the Transformer-based compression module. Extensive results demonstrate the proposed SMC and SMC++ models show remarkable superiority over previous traditional, learnable, and perceptual quality-oriented video codecs, on three video analysis tasks and seven datasets. \textit{Codes and model are available at: https://github.com/tianyuan168326/VideoSemanticCompression-Pytorch.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods typically overlook local manifold structures, leading to compromised discriminative capabilities in perceptual quality evaluation. To address this limitation, we present LML-IQA, an innovative no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) approach that leverages a combination of local manifold learning and contrastive learning. Our approach first extracts multiple patches from each image and identifies the most visually salient region. This salient patch serves as a positive sample for contrastive learning, while other patches from the same image are treated as intra-class negatives to preserve local distinctiveness. Patches from different images also act as inter-class negatives to enhance feature separation. Additionally, we introduce a mutual learning strategy to improve the model's ability to recognize and prioritize visually important regions. Comprehensive experiments across eight benchmark datasets demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, achieving a PLCC of 0.942 on TID2013 (compared to 0.908) and 0.977 on CSIQ (compared to 0.965).

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled significant progress in open vocabulary computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection and image segmentation. Some recent works have focused on extending VLMs to open vocabulary single label action classification in videos. However, previous methods fall short in holistic video understanding which requires the ability to simultaneously recognize multiple actions and entities e.g., objects in the video in an open vocabulary setting. We formulate this problem as open vocabulary multilabel video classification and propose a method to adapt a pre-trained VLM such as CLIP to solve this task. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide semantic guidance to the VLM about class labels to improve its open vocabulary performance with two key contributions. First, we propose an end-to-end trainable architecture that learns to prompt an LLM to generate soft attributes for the CLIP text-encoder to enable it to recognize novel classes. Second, we integrate a temporal modeling module into CLIP's vision encoder to effectively model the spatio-temporal dynamics of video concepts as well as propose a novel regularized finetuning technique to ensure strong open vocabulary classification performance in the video domain. Our extensive experimentation showcases the efficacy of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans are frequently performed in clinical settings. Opportunistic CT involves repurposing routine CT images to extract diagnostic information and is an emerging tool for detecting underdiagnosed conditions such as sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites. This study utilizes deep learning methods to promote accurate diagnosis and clinical documentation. We analyze 2,674 inpatient CT scans to identify discrepancies between imaging phenotypes (characteristics derived from opportunistic CT scans) and their corresponding documentation in radiology reports and ICD coding. Through our analysis, we find that only 0.5%, 3.2%, and 30.7% of scans diagnosed with sarcopenia, hepatic steatosis, and ascites (respectively) through either opportunistic imaging or radiology reports were ICD-coded. Our findings demonstrate opportunistic CT's potential to enhance diagnostic precision and accuracy of risk adjustment models, offering advancements in precision medicine.

Abstract: We present LiDAR-GS, a Gaussian Splatting (GS) method for real-time, high-fidelity re-simulation of LiDAR scans in public urban road scenes. Recent GS methods proposed for cameras have achieved significant advancements in real-time rendering beyond Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). However, applying GS representation to LiDAR, an active 3D sensor type, poses several challenges that must be addressed to preserve high accuracy and unique characteristics. Specifically, LiDAR-GS designs a differentiable laser beam splatting, using range-view representation for precise surface splatting by projecting lasers onto micro cross-sections, effectively eliminating artifacts associated with local affine approximations. Furthermore, LiDAR-GS leverages Neural Gaussian Representation, which further integrate view-dependent clues, to represent key LiDAR properties that are influenced by the incident direction and external factors. Combining these practices with some essential adaptations, e.g., dynamic instances decomposition, LiDAR-GS succeeds in simultaneously re-simulating depth, intensity, and ray-drop channels, achieving state-of-the-art results in both rendering frame rate and quality on publically available large scene datasets when compared with the methods using explicit mesh or implicit NeRF. Our source code is publicly available at https://www.github.com/cqf7419/LiDAR-GS.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel generative video compression framework that leverages motion pattern priors, derived from subtle dynamics in common scenes (e.g., swaying flowers or a boat drifting on water), rather than relying on video content priors (e.g., talking faces or human bodies). These compact motion priors enable a new approach to ultra-low bitrate communication while achieving high-quality reconstruction across diverse scene contents. At the encoder side, motion priors can be streamlined into compact representations via a dense-to-sparse transformation. At the decoder side, these priors facilitate the reconstruction of scene dynamics using an advanced flow-driven diffusion model. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can achieve superior rate-distortion-performance and outperform the state-of-the-art conventional-video codec Enhanced Compression Model (ECM) on-scene dynamics sequences.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) aims to segment classes that are not present in the training dataset. However, most existing studies assume that the training data is fixed in advance, overlooking more practical scenarios where new datasets are continuously collected over time. To address this, we first analyze how existing OVS models perform under such conditions. In this context, we explore several approaches such as retraining, fine-tuning, and continual learning but find that each of them has clear limitations. To address these issues, we propose ConOVS, a novel continual learning method based on a Mixture-of-Experts framework. ConOVS dynamically combines expert decoders based on the probability that an input sample belongs to the distribution of each incremental dataset. Through extensive experiments, we show that ConOVS consistently outperforms existing methods across pre-training, incremental, and zero-shot test datasets, effectively expanding the recognition capabilities of OVS models when data is collected sequentially.

Abstract: Existing feedforward image-to-3D methods mainly rely on 2D multi-view diffusion models that cannot guarantee 3D consistency. These methods easily collapse when changing the prompt view direction and mainly handle object-centric cases. In this paper, we propose a novel single-stage 3D diffusion model, DiffusionGS, for object generation and scene reconstruction from a single view. DiffusionGS directly outputs 3D Gaussian point clouds at each timestep to enforce view consistency and allow the model to generate robustly given prompt views of any directions, beyond object-centric inputs. Plus, to improve the capability and generality of DiffusionGS, we scale up 3D training data by developing a scene-object mixed training strategy. Experiments show that DiffusionGS yields improvements of 2.20 dB/23.25 and 1.34 dB/19.16 in PSNR/FID for objects and scenes than the state-of-the-art methods, without depth estimator.

Abstract: This survey provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in multimodal alignment and fusion within the field of machine learning, driven by the increasing availability and diversity of data modalities such as text, images, audio, and video. Unlike previous surveys that often focus on specific modalities or limited fusion strategies, our work presents a structure-centric and method-driven framework that emphasizes generalizable techniques. We systematically categorize and analyze key approaches to alignment and fusion through both structural perspectives -- data-level, feature-level, and output-level fusion -- and methodological paradigms -- including statistical, kernel-based, graphical, generative, contrastive, attention-based, and large language model (LLM)-based methods, drawing insights from an extensive review of over 260 relevant studies. Furthermore, this survey highlights critical challenges such as cross-modal misalignment, computational bottlenecks, data quality issues, and the modality gap, along with recent efforts to address them. Applications ranging from social media analysis and medical imaging to emotion recognition and embodied AI are explored to illustrate the real-world impact of robust multimodal systems. The insights provided aim to guide future research toward optimizing multimodal learning systems for improved scalability, robustness, and generalizability across diverse domains.

Abstract: Structuring latent representations in a hierarchical manner enables models to learn patterns at multiple levels of abstraction. However, most prevalent image understanding models focus on visual similarity, and learning visual hierarchies is relatively unexplored. In this work, for the first time, we introduce a learning paradigm that can encode user-defined multi-level complex visual hierarchies in hyperbolic space without requiring explicit hierarchical labels. As a concrete example, first, we define a part-based image hierarchy using object-level annotations within and across images. Then, we introduce an approach to enforce the hierarchy using contrastive loss with pairwise entailment metrics. Finally, we discuss new evaluation metrics to effectively measure hierarchical image retrieval. Encoding these complex relationships ensures that the learned representations capture semantic and structural information that transcends mere visual similarity. Experiments in part-based image retrieval show significant improvements in hierarchical retrieval tasks, demonstrating the capability of our model in capturing visual hierarchies.

Abstract: Condensing large datasets into smaller synthetic counterparts has demonstrated its promise for image classification. However, previous research has overlooked a crucial concern in image recognition: ensuring that models trained on condensed datasets are unbiased towards protected attributes (PA), such as gender and race. Our investigation reveals that dataset distillation fails to alleviate the unfairness towards minority groups within original datasets. Moreover, this bias typically worsens in the condensed datasets due to their smaller size. To bridge the research gap, we propose a novel fair dataset distillation (FDD) framework, namely FairDD, which can be seamlessly applied to diverse matching-based DD approaches (DDs), requiring no modifications to their original architectures. The key innovation of FairDD lies in synchronously matching synthetic datasets to PA-wise groups of original datasets, rather than indiscriminate alignment to the whole distributions in vanilla DDs, dominated by majority groups. This synchronized matching allows synthetic datasets to avoid collapsing into majority groups and bootstrap their balanced generation to all PA groups. Consequently, FairDD could effectively regularize vanilla DDs to favor biased generation toward minority groups while maintaining the accuracy of target attributes. Theoretical analyses and extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that FairDD significantly improves fairness compared to vanilla DDs, with a promising trade-off between fairness and accuracy. Its consistent superiority across diverse DDs, spanning Distribution and Gradient Matching, establishes it as a versatile FDD approach. Code is available at https://github.com/zqhang/FairDD.

Abstract: Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has emerged as a promising approach for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) of visual representations. However, the out-of-the-box performance of MIMs is typically inferior to competing approaches. Most users cannot afford fine-tuning due to the need for large amounts of data, high GPU consumption, and specialized user knowledge. Therefore, the practical use of MIM representations is limited. In this paper we ask what is the reason for the poor out-of-the-box performance of MIMs. Is it due to weaker features produced by MIM models, or is it due to suboptimal usage? Through detailed analysis, we show that attention in MIMs is spread almost uniformly over many patches, leading to ineffective aggregation by the [cls] token. Based on this insight, we propose Selective Aggregation to better capture the rich semantic information retained in patch tokens, which significantly improves the out-of-the-box performance of MIM.

Abstract: Recent advancements in view synthesis have significantly enhanced immersive experiences across various computer graphics and multimedia applications, including telepresence and entertainment. By enabling the generation of new perspectives from a single input view, view synthesis allows users to better perceive and interact with their environment. However, many state-of-the-art methods, while achieving high visual quality, face limitations in real-time performance, which makes them less suitable for live applications where low latency is critical. In this paper, we present a lightweight, position-aware network designed for real-time view synthesis from a single input image and a target camera pose. The proposed framework consists of a Position Aware Embedding, which efficiently maps positional information from the target pose to generate high dimensional feature maps. These feature maps, along with the input image, are fed into a Rendering Network that merges features from dual encoder branches to resolve both high and low level details, producing a realistic new view of the scene. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior efficiency and visual quality compared to existing approaches, particularly in handling complex translational movements without explicit geometric operations like warping. This work marks a step toward enabling real-time live and interactive telepresence applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the mainstream approach for visual generation. However, these models typically suffer from sample inefficiency and high training costs. Consequently, methods for efficient finetuning, inference and personalization were quickly adopted by the community. However, training these models in the first place remains very costly. While several recent approaches - including masking, distillation, and architectural modifications - have been proposed to improve training efficiency, each of these methods comes with a tradeoff: they achieve enhanced performance at the expense of increased computational cost or vice versa. In contrast, this work aims to improve training efficiency as well as generative performance at the same time through routes that act as a transport mechanism for randomly selected tokens from early layers to deeper layers of the model. Our method is not limited to the common transformer-based model - it can also be applied to state-space models and achieves this without architectural modifications or additional parameters. Finally, we show that TREAD reduces computational cost and simultaneously boosts model performance on the standard ImageNet-256 benchmark in class-conditional synthesis. Both of these benefits multiply to a convergence speedup of 14x at 400K training iterations compared to DiT and 37x compared to the best benchmark performance of DiT at 7M training iterations. Furthermore, we achieve a competitive FID of 2.09 in a guided and 3.93 in an unguided setting, which improves upon the DiT, without architectural changes.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models face limitations in building extra-large scale outdoor scenes, primarily due to the lack of sufficiently large-scale and detailed datasets. In this paper, we present a extra-large fine-grained dataset with 10 billion points composed of 41,006 drone-captured high-resolution aerial images, covering 20 diverse and culturally significant scenes from worldwide locations such as Cambridge Uni main buildings, the Pyramids, and the Forbidden City Palace. Compared to existing datasets, ours offers significantly larger scale and higher detail, uniquely suited for fine-grained 3D applications. Each scene contains an accurate spatial layout and comprehensive structural information, supporting detailed 3D reconstruction tasks. By reconstructing environments using these detailed images, our dataset supports multiple applications, including outputs in the widely adopted COLMAP format, establishing a novel benchmark for evaluating state-of-the-art large-scale Gaussian Splatting methods.The dataset's flexibility encourages innovations and supports model plug-ins, paving the way for future 3D breakthroughs. All datasets and code will be open-sourced for community use.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in text-to-image generative models, they are prone to adversarial attacks and inadvertently generate unsafe, unethical content. Existing approaches often rely on fine-tuning models to remove specific concepts, which is computationally expensive, lacks scalability, and/or compromises generation quality. In this work, we propose a novel framework leveraging k-sparse autoencoders (k-SAEs) to enable efficient and interpretable concept manipulation in diffusion models. Specifically, we first identify interpretable monosemantic concepts in the latent space of text embeddings and leverage them to precisely steer the generation away or towards a given concept (e.g., nudity) or to introduce a new concept (e.g., photographic style) -- all during test time. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach is very simple, requires no retraining of the base model nor LoRA adapters, does not compromise the generation quality, and is robust to adversarial prompt manipulations. Our method yields an improvement of $\mathbf{20.01\%}$ in unsafe concept removal, is effective in style manipulation, and is $\mathbf{\sim5}$x faster than the current state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Customization of text-to-image models enables users to insert new concepts or objects and generate them in unseen settings. Existing methods either rely on comparatively expensive test-time optimization or train encoders on single-image datasets without multi-image supervision, which can limit image quality. We propose a simple approach to address these challenges. We first leverage existing text-to-image models and 3D datasets to create a high-quality Synthetic Customization Dataset (SynCD) consisting of multiple images of the same object in different lighting, backgrounds, and poses. Using this dataset, we train an encoder-based model that incorporates fine-grained visual details from reference images via a shared attention mechanism. Finally, we propose an inference technique that normalizes text and image guidance vectors to mitigate overexposure issues in sampled images. Through extensive experiments, we show that our encoder-based model, trained on SynCD, and with the proposed inference algorithm, improves upon existing encoder-based methods on standard customization benchmarks.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation enhances the performance of compact student networks by transferring knowledge from more powerful teacher networks without introducing additional parameters. In the feature space, local regions within an individual global feature encode distinct yet interdependent semantic information. Previous feature-based distillation methods mainly emphasize global feature alignment while neglecting the decoupling of local regions within an individual global feature, which often results in semantic confusion and suboptimal performance. Moreover, conventional contrastive representation distillation suffers from low efficiency due to its reliance on a large memory buffer to store feature samples. To address these limitations, this work proposes MSDCRD, a model-agnostic distillation framework that systematically decouples global features into multi-scale local features and leverages the resulting semantically rich feature samples with tailored sample-wise and feature-wise contrastive losses. This design enables efficient distillation using only a single batch, eliminating the dependence on external memory. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MSDCRD achieves superior performance not only in homogeneous teacher-student settings but also in heterogeneous architectures where feature discrepancies are more pronounced, highlighting its strong generalization capability.

Abstract: Compressed video super-resolution (SR) aims to generate high-resolution (HR) videos from the corresponding low-resolution (LR) compressed videos. Recently, some compressed video SR methods attempt to exploit the spatio-temporal information in the frequency domain, showing great promise in super-resolution performance. However, these methods do not differentiate various frequency subbands spatially or capture the temporal frequency dynamics, potentially leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we propose a deep frequency-based compressed video SR model (FCVSR) consisting of a motion-guided adaptive alignment (MGAA) network and a multi-frequency feature refinement (MFFR) module. Additionally, a frequency-aware contrastive loss is proposed for training FCVSR, in order to reconstruct finer spatial details. The proposed model has been evaluated on three public compressed video super-resolution datasets, with results demonstrating its effectiveness when compared to existing works in terms of super-resolution performance (up to a 0.14dB gain in PSNR over the second-best model) and complexity.

Abstract: Whole slide pathology image classification presents challenges due to gigapixel image sizes and limited annotation labels, hindering model generalization. This paper introduces a prompt learning method to adapt large vision-language models for few-shot pathology classification. We first extend the Prov-GigaPath vision foundation model, pre-trained on 1.3 billion pathology image tiles, into a vision-language model by adding adaptors and aligning it with medical text encoders via contrastive learning on 923K image-text pairs. The model is then used to extract visual features and text embeddings from few-shot annotations and fine-tunes with learnable prompt embeddings. Unlike prior methods that combine prompts with frozen features using prefix embeddings or self-attention, we propose multi-granular attention that compares interactions between learnable prompts with individual image patches and groups of them. This approach improves the model's ability to capture both fine-grained details and broader context, enhancing its recognition of complex patterns across sub-regions. To further improve accuracy, we leverage (unbalanced) optimal transport-based visual-text distance to secure model robustness by mitigating perturbations that might occur during the data augmentation process. Empirical experiments on lung, kidney, and breast pathology modalities validate the effectiveness of our approach; thereby, we surpass several of the latest competitors and consistently improve performance across diverse architectures, including CLIP, PLIP, and Prov-GigaPath integrated PLIP.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has emerged as a strong base model in various pinhole imaging segmentation tasks. However, when applying it to $360^\circ$ domain, the significant field-of-view (FoV) gap between pinhole ($70^\circ \times 70^\circ$) and panoramic images ($180^\circ \times 360^\circ$) poses unique challenges. Two major concerns for this application includes 1) inevitable distortion and object deformation brought by the large FoV disparity between domains; 2) the lack of pixel-level semantic understanding that the original SAM2 cannot provide. To address these issues, we propose a novel OmniSAM framework, which makes the first attempt to apply SAM2 for panoramic semantic segmentation. Specifically, to bridge the first gap, OmniSAM first divides the panorama into sequences of patches. These patches are then treated as image sequences in similar manners as in video segmentation tasks. We then leverage the SAM2's memory mechanism to extract cross-patch correspondences that embeds the cross-FoV dependencies, improving feature continuity and the prediction consistency along mask boundaries. For the second gap, OmniSAM fine-tunes the pretrained image encoder and reutilize the mask decoder for semantic prediction. An FoV-based prototypical adaptation module with dynamic pseudo label update mechanism is also introduced to facilitate the alignment of memory and backbone features, thereby improving model generalization ability across different sizes of source models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OmniSAM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by large margins, e.g., 79.06% (+10.22%) on SPin8-to-SPan8, 62.46% (+6.58%) on CS13-to-DP13.

Abstract: Blind video super-resolution (BVSR) is a low-level vision task which aims to generate high-resolution videos from low-resolution counterparts in unknown degradation scenarios. Existing approaches typically predict blur kernels that are spatially invariant in each video frame or even the entire video. These methods do not consider potential spatio-temporal varying degradations in videos, resulting in suboptimal BVSR performance. In this context, we propose a novel BVSR model based on Implicit Kernels, BVSR-IK, which constructs a multi-scale kernel dictionary parameterized by implicit neural representations. It also employs a newly designed recurrent Transformer to predict the coefficient weights for accurate filtering in both frame correction and feature alignment. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed BVSR-IK, when compared with four state-of-the-art BVSR models on three commonly used datasets, with BVSR-IK outperforming the second best approach, FMA-Net, by up to 0.59 dB in PSNR.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in standard RGB image processing tasks. However, applying ViTs to multi-channel imaging (MCI) data, e.g., for medical and remote sensing applications, remains a challenge. In particular, MCI data often consist of layers acquired from different modalities. Directly training ViTs on such data can obscure complementary information and impair the performance. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective pretraining framework for large-scale MCI datasets. Our method, named Isolated Channel ViT (IC-ViT), patchifies image channels individually and thereby enables pretraining for multimodal multi-channel tasks. We show that this channel-wise patchifying is a key technique for MCI processing. More importantly, one can pretrain the IC-ViT on single channels and finetune it on downstream multi-channel datasets. This pretraining framework captures dependencies between patches as well as channels and produces robust feature representation. Experiments on various tasks and benchmarks, including JUMP-CP and CHAMMI for cell microscopy imaging, and So2Sat-LCZ42 for satellite imaging, show that the proposed IC-ViT delivers 4-14 percentage points of performance improvement over existing channel-adaptive approaches. Further, its efficient training makes it a suitable candidate for large-scale pretraining of foundation models on heterogeneous data. Our code is available at https://github.com/shermanlian/IC-ViT.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved notable performance in the fields of computer vision and natural language processing with various applications in both academia and industry. However, with recent advancements in DNNs and transformer models with a tremendous number of parameters, deploying these large models on edge devices causes serious issues such as high runtime and memory consumption. This is especially concerning with the recent large-scale foundation models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and Large Language Models (LLMs). Knowledge Distillation (KD) is one of the prominent techniques proposed to address the aforementioned problems using a teacher-student architecture. More specifically, a lightweight student model is trained using additional knowledge from a cumbersome teacher model. In this work, a comprehensive survey of knowledge distillation methods is proposed. This includes reviewing KD from different aspects: distillation sources, distillation schemes, distillation algorithms, distillation by modalities, applications of distillation, and comparison among existing methods. In contrast to most existing surveys, which are either outdated or simply update former surveys, this work proposes a comprehensive survey with a new point of view and representation structure that categorizes and investigates the most recent methods in knowledge distillation. This survey considers various critically important subcategories, including KD for diffusion models, 3D inputs, foundational models, transformers, and LLMs. Furthermore, existing challenges in KD and possible future research directions are discussed.

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have transformed image generation, enabling significant progress in stylized generation using only a few style reference images. However, current diffusion-based methods struggle with fine-grained style customization due to challenges in controlling multiple style attributes, such as color and texture. This paper introduces the first tuning-free approach to achieve free-lunch color-texture disentanglement in stylized T2I generation, addressing the need for independently controlled style elements for the Disentangled Stylized Image Generation (DisIG) problem. Our approach leverages the Image-Prompt Additivity property in the CLIP image embedding space to develop techniques for separating and extracting Color-Texture Embeddings (CTE) from individual color and texture reference images. To ensure that the color palette of the generated image aligns closely with the color reference, we apply a whitening and coloring transformation to enhance color consistency. Additionally, to prevent texture loss due to the signal-leak bias inherent in diffusion training, we introduce a noise term that preserves textural fidelity during the Regularized Whitening and Coloring Transformation (RegWCT). Through these methods, our Style Attributes Disentanglement approach (SADis) delivers a more precise and customizable solution for stylized image generation. Experiments on images from the WikiArt and StyleDrop datasets demonstrate that, both qualitatively and quantitatively, SADis surpasses state-of-the-art stylization methods in the DisIG task.Code is released at https://deepffff.github.io/sadis.github.io/.

Abstract: Many 3D tasks such as pose alignment, animation, motion transfer, and 3D reconstruction rely on establishing correspondences between 3D shapes. This challenge has recently been approached by pairwise matching of semantic features from pre-trained vision models. However, despite their power, these features struggle to differentiate instances of the same semantic class such as ``left hand'' versus ``right hand'' which leads to substantial mapping errors. To solve this, we learn a surface-aware embedding space that is robust to these ambiguities while facilitating shared mapping for an entire family of 3D shapes. Importantly, our approach is self-supervised and requires only a small number of unpaired training meshes to infer features for new possibly imperfect 3D shapes at test time. We achieve this by introducing a contrastive loss that preserves the semantic content of the features distilled from foundational models while disambiguating features located far apart on the shape's surface. We observe superior performance in correspondence matching benchmarks and enable downstream applications including 2D-to-3D and 3D-to-3D texture transfer, in-part segmentation, pose alignment, and motion transfer in low-data regimes. Unlike previous pairwise approaches, our solution constructs a joint embedding space, where both seen and unseen 3D shapes are implicitly aligned without further optimization.

This gap arises from an overemphasis on instruction-following abilities, while neglecting the proactive understanding of visual information. Inspired by this, L2T adopts a simple yet effective approach by incorporating the loss function into both the instruction and response sequences. It seamlessly expands the training data, and regularizes the MLLMs from overly relying on language priors. Based on this merit, L2T achieves a significant relative improvement of up to 9% on comprehensive multimodal benchmarks, requiring no additional training data and incurring negligible computational overhead. Surprisingly, L2T attains exceptional fundamental visual capabilities, yielding up to an 18% improvement in captioning performance, while simultaneously alleviating hallucination in MLLMs. Github code: https://github.com/Feng-Hong/L2T.

Abstract: Low signal-to-noise ratio videos -- such as those from underwater sonar, ultrasound, and microscopy -- pose significant challenges for computer vision models, particularly when paired clean imagery is unavailable. We present Spatiotemporal Augmentations and denoising in Video for Downstream Tasks (SAVeD), a novel self-supervised method that denoises low-SNR sensor videos using only raw noisy data. By leveraging distinctions between foreground and background motion and exaggerating objects with stronger motion signal, SAVeD enhances foreground object visibility and reduces background and camera noise without requiring clean video. SAVeD has a set of architectural optimizations that lead to faster throughput, training, and inference than existing deep learning methods. We also introduce a new denoising metric, FBD, which indicates foreground-background divergence for detection datasets without requiring clean imagery. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for classification, detection, tracking, and counting tasks, and it does so with fewer training resource requirements than existing deep-learning-based denoising methods.

Abstract: Advertisement videos serve as a rich and valuable source of purpose-driven information, encompassing high-quality visual, textual, and contextual cues designed to engage viewers. They are often more complex than general videos of similar duration due to their structured narratives and rapid scene transitions, posing significant challenges to multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). In this work, we introduce VideoAds, the first dataset tailored for benchmarking the performance of MLLMs on advertisement videos. VideoAds comprises well-curated advertisement videos with complex temporal structures, accompanied by \textbf{manually} annotated diverse questions across three core tasks: visual finding, video summary, and visual reasoning. We propose a quantitative measure to compare VideoAds against existing benchmarks in terms of video complexity. Through extensive experiments, we find that Qwen2.5-VL-72B, an opensource MLLM, achieves 73.35\% accuracy on VideoAds, outperforming GPT-4o (66.82\%) and Gemini-1.5 Pro (69.66\%); the two proprietary models especially fall behind the opensource model in video summarization and reasoning, but perform the best in visual finding. Notably, human experts easily achieve a remarkable accuracy of 94.27\%. These results underscore the necessity of advancing MLLMs' temporal modeling capabilities and highlight VideoAds as a potentially pivotal benchmark for future research in understanding video that requires high FPS sampling. The dataset and evaluation code will be publicly available at https://videoadsbenchmark.netlify.app.

Abstract: Human infants rapidly develop visual reasoning skills from minimal input, suggesting that developmentally inspired pretraining could significantly enhance the efficiency of vision-language models (VLMs). Although recent efforts have leveraged infant-inspired datasets like SAYCam, existing evaluation benchmarks remain misaligned--they are either too simplistic, narrowly scoped, or tailored for large-scale pretrained models. Additionally, training exclusively on infant data overlooks the broader, diverse input from which infants naturally learn. To address these limitations, we propose BabyVLM, a novel framework comprising comprehensive in-domain evaluation benchmarks and a synthetic training dataset created via child-directed transformations of existing datasets. We demonstrate that VLMs trained with our synthetic dataset achieve superior performance on BabyVLM tasks compared to models trained solely on SAYCam or general-purpose data of the SAYCam size. BabyVLM thus provides a robust, developmentally aligned evaluation tool and illustrates how compact models trained on carefully curated data can generalize effectively, opening pathways toward data-efficient vision-language learning paradigms.

Abstract: Conventional infrared and visible image fusion(IVIF) methods often assume high-quality inputs, neglecting real-world degradations such as low-light and noise, which limits their practical applicability. To address this, we propose a Degradation-Decoupled Fusion(DDFusion) framework, which achieves degradation decoupling and jointly models degradation suppression and image fusion in a unified manner. Specifically, the Degradation-Decoupled Optimization Network(DDON) performs degradation-specific decomposition to decouple inter-degradation and degradation-information components, followed by component-specific extraction paths for effective suppression of degradation and enhancement of informative features. The Interactive Local-Global Fusion Network (ILGFN) aggregates complementary features across multi-scale pathways and alleviates performance degradation caused by the decoupling between degradation optimization and image fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDFusion achieves superior fusion performance under both clean and degraded conditions. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lmmh058/DDFusion.

Abstract: Fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for infrared small target detection poses significant challenges due to severe domain shifts. Existing adaptation methods often incorporate handcrafted priors to bridge this gap, yet such designs limit generalization and scalability. We identify a fundamental texture bias in foundation models, which overly depend on local texture cues for target localization. To address this, we propose Ladder Shape-Biased Side-Tuning (LSP-ST), a novel approach that introduces a shape-aware inductive bias to facilitate effective adaptation beyond texture cues. In contrast to prior work that injects explicit edge or contour features, LSP-ST models shape as a global structural prior, integrating both boundaries and internal layouts. We design a Shape-Enhanced Large-Kernel Attention Module to hierarchically and implicitly capture structural information in a fully differentiable manner, without task-specific handcrafted guidance. A theoretical analysis grounded in matched filtering and backpropagation reveals the mechanism by which the proposed attention improves structure-aware learning. With only 4.72M learnable parameters, LSP-ST achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple infrared small target detection benchmarks. Furthermore, its strong generalization is validated across tasks such as mirror detection, shadow detection, and camouflaged object detection, while maintaining stable performance on texture-driven tasks like salient object detection, demonstrating that the introduced shape bias complements rather than competes with texture-based reasoning.

<title>Motion-Enhanced Nonlocal Similarity Implicit Neural Representation for Infrared Dim and Small Target Detection</title>

Abstract: Infrared dim and small target detection presents a significant challenge due to dynamic multi-frame scenarios and weak target signatures in the infrared modality. Traditional low-rank plus sparse models often fail to capture dynamic backgrounds and global spatial-temporal correlations, which results in background leakage or target loss. In this paper, we propose a novel motion-enhanced nonlocal similarity implicit neural representation (INR) framework to address these challenges. We first integrate motion estimation via optical flow to capture subtle target movements, and propose multi-frame fusion to enhance motion saliency. Second, we leverage nonlocal similarity to construct patch tensors with strong low-rank properties, and propose an innovative tensor decomposition-based INR model to represent the nonlocal patch tensor, effectively encoding both the nonlocal low-rankness and spatial-temporal correlations of background through continuous neural representations. An alternating direction method of multipliers is developed for the nonlocal INR model, which enjoys theoretical fixed-point convergence. Experimental results show that our approach robustly separates dim targets from complex infrared backgrounds, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: We present ViDRiP-LLaVA, the first large multimodal model (LMM) in computational pathology that integrates three distinct image scenarios, including single patch images, automatically segmented pathology video clips, and manually segmented pathology videos. This integration closely mirrors the natural diagnostic process of pathologists. By generating detailed histological descriptions and culminating in a definitive sign-out diagnosis, ViDRiP-LLaVA bridges visual narratives with diagnostic reasoning. Central to our approach is the ViDRiP-Instruct dataset, comprising 4278 video and diagnosis-specific chain-of-thought instructional pairs sourced from educational histopathology videos on YouTube. Although high-quality data is critical for enhancing diagnostic reasoning, its creation is time-intensive and limited in volume. To overcome this challenge, we transfer knowledge from existing single-image instruction datasets to train on weakly annotated, keyframe-extracted clips, followed by fine-tuning on manually segmented videos. ViDRiP-LLaVA establishes a new benchmark in pathology video analysis and offers a promising foundation for future AI systems that support clinical decision-making through integrated visual and diagnostic reasoning. Our code, data, and model are publicly available at: https://github.com/QuIIL/ViDRiP-LLaVA.

Abstract: Recognising expressive behaviours in face videos is a long-standing challenge in Affective Computing. Despite significant advancements in recent years, it still remains a challenge to build a robust and reliable system for naturalistic and in-the-wild facial expressive behaviour analysis in real time. This paper addresses two key challenges in building such a system: (1). The paucity of large-scale labelled facial affect video datasets with extensive coverage of the 2D emotion space, and (2). The difficulty of extracting facial video features that are discriminative, interpretable, robust, and computationally efficient. Toward addressing these challenges, this work introduces xTrace, a robust tool for facial expressive behaviour analysis and predicting continuous values of dimensional emotions, namely valence and arousal, from in-the-wild face videos. To address challenge (1), the proposed affect recognition model is trained on the largest facial affect video data set, containing $\sim$450k videos that cover most emotion zones in the dimensional emotion space, making xTrace highly versatile in analysing a wide spectrum of naturalistic expressive behaviours. To address challenge (2), xTrace uses facial affect descriptors that are not only explainable, but can also achieve a high degree of accuracy and robustness with low computational complexity. The key components of xTrace are benchmarked against three existing tools: MediaPipe, OpenFace, and Augsburg Affect Toolbox. On an in-the-wild benchmarking set composed of $\sim$50k videos, xTrace achieves 0.86 mean Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and on the SEWA test set it achieves 0.75 mean CCC, outperforming existing SOTA by $\sim$7.1\%.

<title>CURE: Concept Unlearning via Orthogonal Representation Editing in Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: As Text-to-Image models continue to evolve, so does the risk of generating unsafe, copyrighted, or privacy-violating content. Existing safety interventions - ranging from training data curation and model fine-tuning to inference-time filtering and guidance - often suffer from incomplete concept removal, susceptibility to jail-breaking, computational inefficiency, or collateral damage to unrelated capabilities. In this paper, we introduce CURE, a training-free concept unlearning framework that operates directly in the weight space of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling fast, interpretable, and highly specific suppression of undesired concepts. At the core of our method is the Spectral Eraser, a closed-form, orthogonal projection module that identifies discriminative subspaces using Singular Value Decomposition over token embeddings associated with the concepts to forget and retain. Intuitively, the Spectral Eraser identifies and isolates features unique to the undesired concept while preserving safe attributes. This operator is then applied in a single step update to yield an edited model in which the target concept is effectively unlearned - without retraining, supervision, or iterative optimization. To balance the trade-off between filtering toxicity and preserving unrelated concepts, we further introduce an Expansion Mechanism for spectral regularization which selectively modulates singular vectors based on their relative significance to control the strength of forgetting. All the processes above are in closed-form, guaranteeing extremely efficient erasure in only $2$ seconds. Benchmarking against prior approaches, CURE achieves a more efficient and thorough removal for targeted artistic styles, objects, identities, or explicit content, with minor damage to original generation ability and demonstrates enhanced robustness against red-teaming.

Abstract: Language-Guided object recognition in remote sensing imagery is crucial for large-scale mapping and automated data annotation. However, existing open-vocabulary and visual grounding methods rely on explicit category cues, limiting their ability to handle complex or implicit queries that require advanced reasoning. To address this issue, we introduce a new suite of tasks, including Instruction-Oriented Object Counting, Detection, and Segmentation (InstructCDS), covering open-vocabulary, open-ended, and open-subclass scenarios. We further present EarthInstruct, the first InstructCDS benchmark for earth observation. It is constructed from two diverse remote sensing datasets with varying spatial resolutions and annotation rules across 20 categories, necessitating models to interpret dataset-specific instructions. Given the scarcity of semantically rich labeled data in remote sensing, we propose InstructSAM, a training-free framework for instruction-driven object recognition. InstructSAM leverages large vision-language models to interpret user instructions and estimate object counts, employs SAM2 for mask proposal, and formulates mask-label assignment as a binary integer programming problem. By integrating semantic similarity with counting constraints, InstructSAM efficiently assigns categories to predicted masks without relying on confidence thresholds. Experiments demonstrate that InstructSAM matches or surpasses specialized baselines across multiple tasks while maintaining near-constant inference time regardless of object count, reducing output tokens by 89% and overall runtime by over 32% compared to direct generation approaches. We believe the contributions of the proposed tasks, benchmark, and effective approach will advance future research in developing versatile object recognition systems.

Abstract: While recent text-to-image (T2I) models show impressive capabilities in synthesizing images from brief descriptions, their performance significantly degrades when confronted with long, detail-intensive prompts required in professional applications. We present DetailMaster, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate T2I models' systematic abilities to handle extended textual inputs that contain complex compositional requirements. Our benchmark introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: Character Attributes, Structured Character Locations, Multi-Dimensional Scene Attributes, and Spatial/Interactive Relationships. The benchmark comprises long and detail-rich prompts averaging 284.89 tokens, with high quality validated by expert annotators. Evaluation on 7 general-purpose and 5 long-prompt-optimized T2I models reveals critical performance limitations: state-of-the-art models achieve merely $\sim$50\% accuracy in key dimensions like attribute binding and spatial reasoning, while all models showing progressive performance degradation as prompt length increases. Our analysis reveals fundamental limitations in compositional reasoning, demonstrating that current encoders flatten complex grammatical structures and that diffusion models suffer from attribute leakage under detail-intensive conditions. We open-source our dataset, data curation code, and evaluation tools to advance detail-rich T2I generation and enable applications previously hindered by the lack of a dedicated benchmark.

Abstract: Video diffusion transformers have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality video generation, but remain computationally expensive due to the quadratic complexity of attention over high-dimensional video sequences. Recent acceleration methods enhance the efficiency by exploiting the local sparsity of attention scores; yet they often struggle with accelerating the long-range computation. To address this problem, we propose VORTA, an acceleration framework with two novel components: 1) a sparse attention mechanism that efficiently captures long-range dependencies, and 2) a routing strategy that adaptively replaces full 3D attention with specialized sparse attention variants. VORTA achieves an end-to-end speedup $1.76\times$ without loss of quality on VBench. Furthermore, it can seamlessly integrate with various other acceleration methods, such as model caching and step distillation, reaching up to speedup $14.41\times$ with negligible performance degradation. VORTA demonstrates its efficiency and enhances the practicality of video diffusion transformers in real-world settings. Codes and weights are available at https://github.com/wenhao728/VORTA.

Abstract: Conventional frame-based cameras often struggle with stereo depth estimation in rapidly changing scenes. In contrast, bio-inspired spike cameras emit asynchronous events at microsecond-level resolution, providing an alternative sensing modality. However, existing methods lack specialized stereo algorithms and benchmarks tailored to the spike data. To address this gap, we propose SpikeStereoNet, a brain-inspired framework and the first to estimate stereo depth directly from raw spike streams. The model fuses raw spike streams from two viewpoints and iteratively refines depth estimation through a recurrent spiking neural network (RSNN) update module. To benchmark our approach, we introduce a large-scale synthetic spike stream dataset and a real-world stereo spike dataset with dense depth annotations. SpikeStereoNet outperforms existing methods on both datasets by leveraging spike streams' ability to capture subtle edges and intensity shifts in challenging regions such as textureless surfaces and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore, our framework exhibits strong data efficiency, maintaining high accuracy even with substantially reduced training data. The source code and datasets will be publicly available.

Abstract: Learning shared representations is a primary area of multimodal representation learning. The current approaches to achieve a shared embedding space rely heavily on paired samples from each modality, which are significantly harder to obtain than unpaired ones. In this work, we demonstrate that shared representations can be learned almost exclusively from unpaired data. Our arguments are grounded in the spectral embeddings of the random walk matrices constructed independently from each unimodal representation. Empirical results in computer vision and natural language processing domains support its potential, revealing the effectiveness of unpaired data in capturing meaningful cross-modal relations, demonstrating high capabilities in retrieval tasks, generation, arithmetics, zero-shot, and cross-domain classification. This work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to demonstrate these capabilities almost exclusively from unpaired samples, giving rise to a cross-modal embedding that could be viewed as universal, i.e., independent of the specific modalities of the data.

Abstract: The application of rule-based reinforcement learning (RL) to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) introduces unique challenges and potential deviations from findings in text-only domains, particularly for perception-heavy tasks. This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL, using jigsaw puzzles as a structured experimental framework. Jigsaw puzzles offer inherent ground truth, adjustable difficulty, and demand complex decision-making, making them ideal for this study. Our research reveals several key findings: \textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random guessing on the simplest jigsaw puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \textit{Secondly,} training on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the final answer. \textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing alongside training and task difficulty. \textit{Finally,} our results demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion models, top-tier text-to-image (T2I) models still struggle to achieve precise spatial layout control, i.e. accurately generating entities with specified attributes and locations. Segmentation-mask-to-image (S2I) generation has emerged as a promising solution by incorporating pixel-level spatial guidance and regional text prompts. However, existing S2I methods fail to simultaneously ensure semantic consistency and shape consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Seg2Any, a novel S2I framework built upon advanced multimodal diffusion transformers (e.g. FLUX). First, to achieve both semantic and shape consistency, we decouple segmentation mask conditions into regional semantic and high-frequency shape components. The regional semantic condition is introduced by a Semantic Alignment Attention Mask, ensuring that generated entities adhere to their assigned text prompts. The high-frequency shape condition, representing entity boundaries, is encoded as an Entity Contour Map and then introduced as an additional modality via multi-modal attention to guide image spatial structure. Second, to prevent attribute leakage across entities in multi-entity scenarios, we introduce an Attribute Isolation Attention Mask mechanism, which constrains each entity's image tokens to attend exclusively to themselves during image self-attention. To support open-set S2I generation, we construct SACap-1M, a large-scale dataset containing 1 million images with 5.9 million segmented entities and detailed regional captions, along with a SACap-Eval benchmark for comprehensive S2I evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Seg2Any achieves state-of-the-art performance on both open-set and closed-set S2I benchmarks, particularly in fine-grained spatial and attribute control of entities.

Abstract: Generating multiview-consistent $360^\circ$ ground-level scenes from satellite imagery is a challenging task with broad applications in simulation, autonomous navigation, and digital twin cities. Existing approaches primarily focus on synthesizing individual ground-view panoramas, often relying on auxiliary inputs like height maps or handcrafted projections, and struggle to produce multiview consistent sequences. In this paper, we propose SatDreamer360, a framework that generates geometrically consistent multi-view ground-level panoramas from a single satellite image, given a predefined pose trajectory. To address the large viewpoint discrepancy between ground and satellite images, we adopt a triplane representation to encode scene features and design a ray-based pixel attention mechanism that retrieves view-specific features from the triplane. To maintain multi-frame consistency, we introduce a panoramic epipolar-constrained attention module that aligns features across frames based on known relative poses. To support the evaluation, we introduce {VIGOR++}, a large-scale dataset for generating multi-view ground panoramas from a satellite image, by augmenting the original VIGOR dataset with more ground-view images and their pose annotations. Experiments show that SatDreamer360 outperforms existing methods in both satellite-to-ground alignment and multiview consistency.

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in video understanding, most existing datasets are limited to Earth's gravitational conditions. However, microgravity alters human motion, interactions, and visual semantics, revealing a critical gap for real-world vision systems. This presents a challenge for domain-robust video understanding in safety-critical space applications. To address this, we introduce MicroG-4M, the first benchmark for spatio-temporal and semantic understanding of human activities in microgravity.

<title>Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Commonality-Oriented Gradient Optimization</title>

Abstract: Exploring effective and transferable adversarial examples is vital for understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, adversarial examples generated from surrogate models often exhibit weak transferability in black-box settings due to overfitting. Existing methods improve transferability by diversifying perturbation inputs or applying uniform gradient regularization within surrogate models, yet they have not fully leveraged the shared and unique features of surrogate models trained on the same task, leading to suboptimal transfer performance. Therefore, enhancing perturbations of common information shared by surrogate models and suppressing those tied to individual characteristics offers an effective way to improve transferability. Accordingly, we propose a commonality-oriented gradient optimization strategy (COGO) consisting of two components: Commonality Enhancement (CE) and Individuality Suppression (IS). CE perturbs the mid-to-low frequency regions, leveraging the fact that ViTs trained on the same dataset tend to rely more on mid-to-low frequency information for classification. IS employs adaptive thresholds to evaluate the correlation between backpropagated gradients and model individuality, assigning weights to gradients accordingly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COGO significantly improves the transfer success rates of adversarial attacks, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods.

<title>A PDE-Based Image Dehazing Method via Atmospheric Scattering Theory</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel partial differential equation (PDE) framework for single-image dehazing. We embed the atmospheric scattering model into a PDE featuring edge-preserving diffusion and a nonlocal operator to maintain both local details and global structures. A key innovation is an adaptive regularization mechanism guided by the dark channel prior, which adjusts smoothing strength based on haze density. The framework's mathematical well-posedness is rigorously established by proving the existence and uniqueness of its weak solution in $H_0^1(\Omega)$. An efficient, GPU-accelerated fixed-point solver is used for implementation. Experiments confirm our method achieves effective haze removal while preserving high image fidelity, offering a principled alternative to purely data-driven techniques.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance across multimodal tasks by integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, how vision information contributes to the model's decoding process remains under-explored, as reflected in frequent hallucinations. Through a series of analyses, we found that (i) vision tokens provide meaningful visual information even when hallucinations occur, and (ii) their semantics are encoded in the textual space and become explicit under appropriate vocabulary constraints. Building on these observations, we propose ReVisiT, a simple training-free decoding method that references vision tokens to guide text generation. Our approach leverages the semantic information embedded within vision tokens by projecting them into the text token distribution. Specifically, ReVisiT dynamically selects the most relevant vision token at each decoding step via context-aware constrained divergence minimization, and using its constrained projection to refine the output distribution to better incorporate visual semantics. Across five benchmarks on recent LVLMs, ReVisiT consistently enhances visual grounding with minimal computational overhead, and achieves competitive or superior results to state-of-the-art decoding baselines while reducing computational cost by up to $2\times$.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise as zero-shot goal-conditioned value functions, but their frozen pre-trained representations limit generalization and temporal reasoning. We introduce VITA, a zero-shot value function learning method that enhances both capabilities via test-time adaptation. At inference, a lightweight adaptation module is updated via a gradient step on a meta-learned self-supervised loss, such that each test-time update improves value estimation. By updating sequentially over a trajectory, VITA encodes history into its parameters, addressing the temporal reasoning limitations. To mitigate shortcut learning, we propose a dissimilarity-based sampling strategy that selects semantically diverse segments of the trajectory during training. In real-world robotic manipulation tasks, VITA generalizes from a single training environment to diverse out-of-distribution tasks, environments, and embodiments, outperforming the state-of-the-art zero-shot method using autoregressive VLMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that VITA's zero-shot value estimates can be utilized for reward shaping in offline reinforcement learning, resulting in multi-task policies on the Meta-World benchmark that exceed the performance of those trained with the simulation's fuzzy-logic dense rewards.

Abstract: Bed-related falls remain a major source of injury in hospitals and long-term care facilities, yet many commercial alarms trigger only after a patient has already left the bed. We show that early bed-exit intent can be predicted using only one low-cost load cell mounted under a bed leg. The resulting load signals are first converted into a compact set of complementary images: an RGB line plot that preserves raw waveforms and three texture maps-recurrence plot, Markov transition field, and Gramian angular field-that expose higher-order dynamics. We introduce ViFusionTST, a dual-stream Swin Transformer that processes the line plot and texture maps in parallel and fuses them through cross-attention to learn data-driven modality weights. To provide a realistic benchmark, we collected six months of continuous data from 95 beds in a long-term-care facility. On this real-world dataset ViFusionTST reaches an accuracy of 0.885 and an F1 score of 0.794, surpassing recent 1D and 2D time-series baselines across F1, recall, accuracy, and AUPRC. The results demonstrate that image-based fusion of load-sensor signals for time series classification is a practical and effective solution for real-time, privacy-preserving fall prevention.

<title>OmniVCus: Feedforward Subject-driven Video Customization with Multimodal Control Conditions</title>

Abstract: Existing feedforward subject-driven video customization methods mainly study single-subject scenarios due to the difficulty of constructing multi-subject training data pairs. Another challenging problem that how to use the signals such as depth, mask, camera, and text prompts to control and edit the subject in the customized video is still less explored. In this paper, we first propose a data construction pipeline, VideoCus-Factory, to produce training data pairs for multi-subject customization from raw videos without labels and control signals such as depth-to-video and mask-to-video pairs. Based on our constructed data, we develop an Image-Video Transfer Mixed (IVTM) training with image editing data to enable instructive editing for the subject in the customized video. Then we propose a diffusion Transformer framework, OmniVCus, with two embedding mechanisms, Lottery Embedding (LE) and Temporally Aligned Embedding (TAE). LE enables inference with more subjects by using the training subjects to activate more frame embeddings. TAE encourages the generation process to extract guidance from temporally aligned control signals by assigning the same frame embeddings to the control and noise tokens. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Video demos are at our project page: https://caiyuanhao1998.github.io/project/OmniVCus/. Our code will be released at https://github.com/caiyuanhao1998/Open-OmniVCus

<title>LH2Face: Loss function for Hard High-quality Face</title>

Abstract: In current practical face authentication systems, most face recognition (FR) algorithms are based on cosine similarity with softmax classification. Despite its reliable classification performance, this method struggles with hard samples. A popular strategy to improve FR performance is incorporating angular or cosine margins. However, it does not take face quality or recognition hardness into account, simply increasing the margin value and thus causing an overly uniform training strategy. To address this problem, a novel loss function is proposed, named Loss function for Hard High-quality Face (LH2Face). Firstly, a similarity measure based on the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is stated, specifically focusing on the logarithm of the Probability Density Function (PDF), which represents the distance between a probability distribution and a vector. Then, an adaptive margin-based multi-classification method using softmax, called the Uncertainty-Aware Margin Function, is implemented in the article. Furthermore, proxy-based loss functions are used to apply extra constraints between the proxy and sample to optimize their representation space distribution. Finally, a renderer is constructed that optimizes FR through face reconstruction and vice versa. Our LH2Face is superior to similiar schemes on hard high-quality face datasets, achieving 49.39% accuracy on the IJB-B dataset, which surpasses the second-place method by 2.37%.

<title>DeRIS: Decoupling Perception and Cognition for Enhanced Referring Image Segmentation through Loopback Synergy</title>

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a challenging task that aims to segment objects in an image based on natural language expressions. While prior studies have predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and achieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental bottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose DeRIS, a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key components: perception and cognition. This modular decomposition facilitates a systematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our findings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual deficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current models. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which enhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby enabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text comprehension. Additionally, we analyze and introduce a simple non-referent sample conversion data augmentation to address the long-tail distribution issue related to target existence judgement in general scenarios. Notably, DeRIS demonstrates inherent adaptability to both non- and multi-referents scenarios without requiring specialized architectural modifications, enhancing its general applicability. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/Dmmm1997/DeRIS.

<title>Investigating VLM Hallucination from a Cognitive Psychology Perspective: A First Step Toward Interpretation with Intriguing Observations</title>

Abstract: Hallucination is a long-standing problem that has been actively investigated in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing research commonly attributes hallucinations to technical limitations or sycophancy bias, where the latter means the models tend to generate incorrect answers to align with user expectations. However, these explanations primarily focus on technical or externally driven factors, and may have neglected the possibility that hallucination behaviours might mirror cognitive biases observed in human psychology. In this work, we introduce a psychological taxonomy, categorizing VLMs' cognitive biases that lead to hallucinations, including sycophancy, logical inconsistency, and a newly identified VLMs behaviour: appeal to authority. To systematically analyze these behaviours, we design AIpsych, a scalable benchmark that reveals psychological tendencies in model response patterns. Leveraging this benchmark, we investigate how variations in model architecture and parameter size influence model behaviour when responding to strategically manipulated questions. Our experiments reveal that as model size increases, VLMs exhibit stronger sycophantic tendencies but reduced authority bias, suggesting increasing competence but a potential erosion of response integrity. A human subject study further validates our hypotheses and highlights key behavioural differences between VLMs and human respondents. This work suggests a new perspective for understanding hallucination in VLMs and highlights the importance of integrating psychological principles into model evaluation.

<title>SenseShift6D: Multimodal RGB-D Benchmarking for Robust 6D Pose Estimation across Environment and Sensor Variations</title>

Abstract: Recent advances on 6D object-pose estimation have achieved high performance on representative benchmarks such as LM-O, YCB-V, and T-Less. However, these datasets were captured under fixed illumination and camera settings, leaving the impact of real-world variations in illumination, exposure, gain or depth-sensor mode-and the potential of test-time sensor control to mitigate such variations-largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SenseShift6D, the first RGB-D dataset that physically sweeps 13 RGB exposures, 9 RGB gains, auto-exposure, 4 depth-capture modes, and 5 illumination levels. For five common household objects (spray, pringles, tincase, sandwich, and mouse), we acquire 166.4k RGB and 16.7k depth images, which can provide 1,380 unique sensor-lighting permutations per object pose. Experiments with state-of-the-art models on our dataset demonstrate that applying multimodal sensor control at test time yields substantial performance gains, achieving a 19.5 pp improvement on pretrained generalizable models. It also enhances robustness precisely where those models tend to fail. Moreover, even instance-level pose estimators, where train and test set share identical object and background, performance still varies under environmental and sensor change, demonstrating that test-time sensor control remains effective compared to costly expansions in the quantity and diversity of real-world training data, without any additional training. SenseShift6D extends the object pose evaluation paradigm from data-centered to sensor-aware robustness, laying a foundation for adaptive, self-tuning perception systems capable of operating robustly in uncertain real-world environments.

Abstract: As a challenging vision-language (VL) task, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. Although many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks, demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework. The code and the CIRHS dataset will be released soon.

Abstract: Precise Event Spotting (PES) in sports videos requires frame-level recognition of fine-grained actions from single-camera footage. Existing PES models typically incorporate lightweight temporal modules such as the Gate Shift Module (GSM) or the Gate Shift Fuse to enrich 2D CNN feature extractors with temporal context. However, these modules are limited in both temporal receptive field and spatial adaptability. We propose a Multi-Scale Attention Gate Shift Module (MSAGSM) that enhances GSM with multi-scale temporal shifts and channel grouped spatial attention, enabling efficient modeling of both short and long-term dependencies while focusing on salient regions. MSAGSM is a lightweight, plug-and-play module that integrates seamlessly with diverse 2D backbones. To further advance the field, we introduce the Table Tennis Australia dataset, the first PES benchmark for table tennis containing over 4,800 precisely annotated events. Extensive experiments across four PES benchmarks demonstrate that MSAGSM consistently improves performance with minimal overhead, setting new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is crucial for robot-human assistance, enabling context-aware support. However, models trained on clean datasets degrade in real-world conditions due to unforeseen corruptions, leading to inaccurate predictions. To address this, we introduce the first robustness benchmark for HOI detection, evaluating model resilience under diverse challenges. Despite advances, current models struggle with environmental variability, occlusions, and noise. Our benchmark, RoHOI, includes 20 corruption types based on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets and a new robustness-focused metric. We systematically analyze existing models in the HOI field, revealing significant performance drops under corruptions. To improve robustness, we propose a Semantic-Aware Masking-based Progressive Learning (SAMPL) strategy to guide the model to be optimized based on holistic and partial cues, thus dynamically adjusting the model's optimization to enhance robust feature learning. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, setting a new standard for robust HOI detection.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold considerable promise for applications in healthcare. However, their deployment in safety-critical settings is hindered by two key limitations: (i) sensitivity to prompt design, and (ii) a tendency to generate incorrect responses with high confidence. As clinicians may rely on a model's stated confidence to gauge the reliability of its predictions, it is especially important that when a model expresses high confidence, it is also highly accurate. We introduce Prompt4Trust, the first reinforcement learning (RL) framework for prompt augmentation targeting confidence calibration in MLLMs. A lightweight LLM is trained to produce context-aware auxiliary prompts that guide a downstream task MLLM to generate responses in which the expressed confidence more accurately reflects predictive accuracy. Unlike conventional calibration techniques, Prompt4Trust specifically prioritizes aspects of calibration most critical for safe and trustworthy clinical decision-making. Beyond improvements driven by this clinically motivated calibration objective, our proposed method also improves task accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art medical visual question answering (VQA) performance on the PMC-VQA benchmark, which is composed of multiple-choice questions spanning diverse medical imaging modalities. Moreover, our framework trained with a small downstream task MLLM showed promising zero-shot generalization to larger MLLMs in our experiments, suggesting the potential for scalable calibration without the associated computational costs. This work demonstrates the potential of automated yet human-aligned prompt engineering for improving the the trustworthiness of MLLMs in safety critical settings.

Abstract: Objectives: Timely and accurate detection of colorectal polyps plays a crucial role in diagnosing and preventing colorectal cancer, a major cause of mortality worldwide. This study introduces a new, lightweight, and efficient framework for polyp detection that combines the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm for filtering noisy data with the YOLO-v11n deep learning model.
  Study design: An experimental study leveraging deep learning and outlier removal techniques across multiple public datasets.
  Methods: The proposed approach was tested on five diverse and publicly available datasets: CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, ETIS, and EndoScene. Since these datasets originally lacked bounding box annotations, we converted their segmentation masks into suitable detection labels. To enhance the robustness and generalizability of our model, we apply 5-fold cross-validation and remove anomalous samples using the LOF method configured with 30 neighbors and a contamination ratio of 5%. Cleaned data are then fed into YOLO-v11n, a fast and resource-efficient object detection architecture optimized for real-time applications. We train the model using a combination of modern augmentation strategies to improve detection accuracy under diverse conditions.
  Results: Our approach significantly improves polyp localization performance, achieving a precision of 95.83%, recall of 91.85%, F1-score of 93.48%, mAP@0.5 of 96.48%, and mAP@0.5:0.95 of 77.75%. Compared to previous YOLO-based methods, our model demonstrates enhanced accuracy and efficiency.
  Conclusions: These results suggest that the proposed method is well-suited for real-time colonoscopy support in clinical settings. Overall, the study underscores how crucial data preprocessing and model efficiency are when designing effective AI systems for medical imaging.

Abstract: The pursuit of a generalizable stereo matching model, capable of performing well across varying resolutions and disparity ranges without dataset-specific fine-tuning, has revealed a fundamental trade-off. Iterative local search methods achieve high scores on constrained benchmarks, but their core mechanism inherently limits the global consistency required for true generalization. However, global matching architectures, while theoretically more robust, have historically been rendered infeasible by prohibitive computational and memory costs. We resolve this dilemma with {S\textsuperscript{2}M\textsuperscript{2}}: a global matching architecture that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and high efficiency without relying on cost volume filtering or deep refinement stacks. Our design integrates a multi-resolution transformer for robust long-range correspondence, trained with a novel loss function that concentrates probability on feasible matches. This approach enables a more robust joint estimation of disparity, occlusion, and confidence. {S\textsuperscript{2}M\textsuperscript{2}} establishes a new state of the art on Middlebury v3 and ETH3D benchmarks, significantly outperforming prior methods in most metrics while reconstructing high-quality details with competitive efficiency.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) advances astronomical imaging by enabling cost-effective high-resolution capture, crucial for detecting faraway celestial objects and precise structural analysis. However, existing datasets for astronomical SR (ASR) exhibit three critical limitations: flux inconsistency, object-crop setting, and insufficient data diversity, significantly impeding ASR development. We propose STAR, a large-scale astronomical SR dataset containing 54,738 flux-consistent star field image pairs covering wide celestial regions. These pairs combine Hubble Space Telescope high-resolution observations with physically faithful low-resolution counterparts generated through a flux-preserving data generation pipeline, enabling systematic development of field-level ASR models. To further empower the ASR community, STAR provides a novel Flux Error (FE) to evaluate SR models in physical view. Leveraging this benchmark, we propose a Flux-Invariant Super Resolution (FISR) model that could accurately infer the flux-consistent high-resolution images from input photometry, suppressing several SR state-of-the-art methods by 24.84% on a novel designed flux consistency metric, showing the priority of our method for astrophysics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and the value of our dataset. Code and models are available at https://github.com/GuoCheng12/STAR.

Abstract: Researchers have increasingly adopted Transformer-based models for inertial odometry. While Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their limited sensitivity to local, fine-grained motion variations and lack of inherent inductive biases often hinder localization accuracy and generalization. Recent studies have shown that incorporating large-kernel convolutions and Transformer-inspired architectural designs into CNN can effectively expand the receptive field, thereby improving global motion perception. Motivated by these insights, we propose a novel CNN-based module called the Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM), which adaptively captures both global motion patterns and local, fine-grained motion features from dynamic inputs. This module dynamically generates selective weights based on the input, enabling efficient multi-scale feature aggregation. To further improve temporal modeling, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU), which selectively extracts representative and task-relevant motion features in the temporal domain. This unit addresses the limitations of temporal modeling observed in existing CNN approaches. Built upon DADM and STGU, we present a new CNN-based inertial odometry backbone, named Next Era of Inertial Odometry (IONext). Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that IONext consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer- and CNN-based methods.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road geometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce NovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes front-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a single branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns waypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image and depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt steering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent memory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language backbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the MD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts path-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from 2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations confirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention fusion each contribute the most to these gains. Beyond safety, NovaDrive's shorter routes (resulting from the novel smoothness loss) translate to lower fuel or battery usage, pointing toward leaner, more easily updated driving stacks. NovaDrive can be extended to other embodied-AI domains as well.

Abstract: Autonomous cars need geometric accuracy and semantic understanding to navigate complex environments, yet most stacks handle them separately. We present XYZ-Drive, a single vision-language model that reads a front-camera frame, a 25m $\times$ 25m overhead map, and the next waypoint, then outputs steering and speed. A lightweight goal-centered cross-attention layer lets waypoint tokens highlight relevant image and map patches, supporting both action and textual explanations, before the fused tokens enter a partially fine-tuned LLaMA-3.2 11B model. On the MD-NEX Outdoor-Driving benchmark XYZ-Drive attains 95% success and 0.80 Success weighted by Path Length (SPL), surpassing PhysNav-DG by 15%. and halving collisions, all while significantly improving efficiency by using only a single branch. Sixteen ablations explain the gains. Removing any modality (vision, waypoint, map) drops success by up to 11%, confirming their complementary roles and rich connections. Replacing goal-centered attention with simple concatenation cuts 3% in performance, showing query-based fusion injects map knowledge more effectively. Keeping the transformer frozen loses 5%, showing the importance of fine-tuning when applying VLMs for specific tasks such as autonomous driving. Coarsening map resolution from 10 cm to 40 cm blurs lane edges and raises crash rate. Overall, these results demonstrate that early, token-level fusion of intent and map layout enables accurate, transparent, real-time driving.

Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional entropy model.

Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing involves modifying a source image based on a language instruction and, typically, requires changes to only small local regions. However, existing approaches generate the entire target image rather than selectively regenerate only the intended editing areas. This results in (1) unnecessary computational costs and (2) a bias toward reconstructing non-editing regions, which compromises the quality of the intended edits. To resolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next Editing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where only regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended modification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose to pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once trained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to NEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used image editing benchmarks. Moreover, our model naturally supports test-time scaling (TTS) through iteratively refining its generation in a zero-shot manner. The project page is: https://nep-bigai.github.io/

Abstract: Good form is the difference between strength and strain, yet for the fast-growing community of at-home fitness enthusiasts, expert feedback is often out of reach. FormCoach transforms a simple camera into an always-on, interactive AI training partner, capable of spotting subtle form errors and delivering tailored corrections in real time, leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). We showcase this capability through a web interface and benchmark state-of-the-art VLMs on a dataset of 1,700 expert-annotated user-reference video pairs spanning 22 strength and mobility exercises. To accelerate research in AI-driven coaching, we release both the dataset and an automated, rubric-based evaluation pipeline, enabling standardized comparison across models. Our benchmarks reveal substantial gaps compared to human-level coaching, underscoring both the challenges and opportunities in integrating nuanced, context-aware movement analysis into interactive AI systems. By framing form correction as a collaborative and creative process between humans and machines, FormCoach opens a new frontier in embodied AI.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown strong performance across multimodal tasks. However, they often produce hallucinations -- text that is inconsistent with visual input, due to the limited ability to verify information in different regions of the image. To address this, we propose Multi-Region Fusion Decoding (MRFD), a training-free decoding method that improves factual grounding by modeling inter-region consistency. MRFD identifies salient regions using cross-attention, generates initial responses for each, and computes reliability weights based on Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) among the responses. These weights guide a consistency-aware fusion of per-region predictions, using region-aware prompts inspired by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Experiments across multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that MRFD significantly reduces hallucinations and improves response factuality without requiring model updates.

<title>Error Propagation Mechanisms and Compensation Strategies for Quantized Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have transformed image synthesis by establishing unprecedented quality and creativity benchmarks. Nevertheless, their large-scale deployment faces challenges due to computationally intensive iterative denoising processes. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) provides an effective pathway for accelerating sampling, the iterative nature of diffusion models causes stepwise quantization errors to accumulate progressively during generation, inevitably compromising output fidelity. To address this challenge, we develop a theoretical framework that mathematically formulates error propagation in Diffusion Models (DMs), deriving per-step quantization error propagation equations and establishing the first closed-form solution for cumulative error. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a timestep-aware cumulative error compensation scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple image datasets demonstrate that our compensation strategy effectively mitigates error propagation, significantly enhancing existing PTQ methods. Specifically, it achieves a 1.2 PSNR improvement over SVDQuant on SDXL W4A4, while incurring only an additional $<$ 0.5\% time overhead.

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. Nevertheless, they continue to exhibit notable limitations in spatial understanding and reasoning, the very capability that anchors artificial general intelligence in the physical world. With the recent release of GPT-5, allegedly the most powerful AI model to date, it is timely to examine where the leading models (GPT, Gemini, Grok, Seed, Qwen, and Intern) stand on the path toward spatial intelligence. We first propose a holistic taxonomy of spatial tasks that unifies existing benchmarks and a standardized protocol for the fair evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models across eight key benchmarks, at a cost exceeding ten billion total tokens. Our empirical study then reveals that (1) GPT-5 demonstrates unprecedented strength in spatial intelligence (SI), yet (2) still falls short of human performance significantly across a broad spectrum of SI-tasks. Moreover, we (3) show that SI-tasks expose greater model capability deficiency than non-SI tasks, to the extent that (4) proprietary models do not exhibit a decisive advantage when facing the most difficult ones. In addition, we conduct a qualitative evaluation across a diverse set of scenarios that are intuitive for humans, yet fail even the most advanced multimodal models.

Abstract: Retrieving relevant visual and textual information from medical literature and hospital records can enhance diagnostic accuracy for clinical image interpretation. We develop a multimodal retrieval model jointly optimized with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG which doesn't backpropagate LVLM errors to the retriever. Using only general-purpose backbones with lightweight fine-tuning, our model achieves competitive results with medically-pretrained models on clinical classification and VQA tasks. In a novel analysis, we find that different top-retrieved images often yield different predictions for the same target, and that these cases are challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle, and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room for improvement by future methods.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition costs in training robust object detection models for complex industrial environments, such as offshore oil platforms. Data collection in these hazardous settings often limits the development of autonomous inspection systems. To mitigate this issue, we propose a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that integrates procedural rendering and AI-driven video generation. The approach uses BlenderProc to produce photorealistic images with domain randomization and NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2 to generate physically consistent video sequences with temporal variation. A YOLO-based detector trained on a composite dataset, combining real and synthetic data, outperformed models trained solely on real images. A 1:1 ratio between real and synthetic samples achieved the highest accuracy. The results demonstrate that synthetic data generation is a viable, cost-effective, and safe strategy for developing reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained industrial applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models process visual inputs independently at each timestep, discarding valuable temporal information inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO, SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0 percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline), cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and 8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably, TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while improving task success rates.

Abstract: Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video-grounded chatbot systems and navigation robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is challenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). To address this, we first build lightweight captioning models using a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times smaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluate their performance not only on single-sentence but on detailed captioning tasks. We obtain surprising results showing that our model can achieve performance comparable to MLLMs, suggesting its potential to serve as a strong captioning specialist for on-device applications. While promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it suffers from occasional captioning errors. We investigate the underlying causes and observe that the problems stem from ineffective attention mechanisms and limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel captioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality by refining coarse descriptions into more precise captions. At its core, DeepLens improves visual grounding by re-examining the informative regions identified in the initial glance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model over both recent lightweight captioning methods and MLLMs in detailed captioning and even in long-range video QA tasks.

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases, Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and ``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5, 43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8 milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m) struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5 values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions, addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform adequately.

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent, limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in livestock monitoring applications.

Abstract: Deep models often suffer significant performance degradation under distribution shifts. Domain generalization (DG) seeks to mitigate this challenge by enabling models to generalize to unseen domains. Most prior approaches rely on multi-domain training or computationally intensive test-time adaptation. In contrast, we propose a complementary strategy: lightweight test-time augmentation. Specifically, we develop a novel Class-Invariant Test-Time Augmentation (CI-TTA) technique. The idea is to generate multiple variants of each input image through elastic and grid deformations that nevertheless belong to the same class as the original input. Their predictions are aggregated through a confidence-guided filtering scheme that remove unreliable outputs, ensuring the final decision relies on consistent and trustworthy cues. Extensive Experiments on PACS and Office-Home datasets demonstrate consistent gains across different DG algorithms and backbones, highlighting the effectiveness and generality of our approach.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely diminishes patients' quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1) Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior), which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than 20%.

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot, inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion attributes according to target Laban tags.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models (VideoLLMs) call for new evaluation protocols and benchmarks for complex temporal reasoning in video-language understanding. Inspired by the needle in a haystack test widely used by LLMs, we introduce a novel task of Needle in a Montage (NeMo), designed to assess VideoLLMs' critical reasoning capabilities, including long-context recall and temporal grounding. To generate video question answering data for our task, we develop a scalable automated data generation pipeline that facilitates high-quality data synthesis. Built upon the proposed pipeline, we present NeMoBench, a video-language benchmark centered on our task. Specifically, our full set of NeMoBench features 31,378 automatically generated question-answer (QA) pairs from 13,486 videos with various durations ranging from seconds to hours. Experiments demonstrate that our pipeline can reliably and automatically generate high-quality evaluation data, enabling NeMoBench to be continuously updated with the latest videos. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art models on our benchmark, providing extensive results and key insights into their capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration. SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090 GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation, which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover, SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have delivered strong reasoning capabilities in natural image domains, yet their potential for Earth Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. EO tasks introduce unique challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning, change detection, grounding, and temporal analysis, that demand task aware reasoning. We propose a novel post training framework that incorporates task aware rewards to enable effective adaptation of reasoning based RL models to diverse EO tasks. This training strategy enhances reasoning capabilities for remote sensing images, stabilizes optimization, and improves robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple EO benchmarks show consistent performance gains over state of the art generic and specialized vision language models. Code and models will be released publicly at https://mustansarfiaz.github.io/GeoVLM-R1/ .

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps), which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in $\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data has be released.

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms. Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion: AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However, most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU, Replica, and BlendedMVS datasets.

Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision. However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

Abstract: Gradient Inversion Attacks invert the transmitted gradients in Federated Learning (FL) systems to reconstruct the sensitive data of local clients and have raised considerable privacy concerns. A majority of gradient inversion methods rely heavily on explicit prior knowledge (e.g., a well pre-trained generative model), which is often unavailable in realistic scenarios. This is because real-world client data distributions are often highly heterogeneous, domain-specific, and unavailable to attackers, making it impractical for attackers to obtain perfectly matched pre-trained models, which inevitably suffer from fundamental distribution shifts relative to target private data. To alleviate this issue, researchers have proposed to leverage the implicit prior knowledge of an over-parameterized network. However, they only utilize a fixed neural architecture for all the attack settings. This would hinder the adaptive use of implicit architectural priors and consequently limit the generalizability. In this paper, we further exploit such implicit prior knowledge by proposing Gradient Inversion via Neural Architecture Search (GI-NAS), which adaptively searches the network and captures the implicit priors behind neural architectures. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed GI-NAS can achieve superior attack performance compared to state-of-the-art gradient inversion methods, even under more practical settings with high-resolution images, large-sized batches, and advanced defense strategies. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to successfully introduce NAS to the gradient inversion community. We believe that this work exposes critical vulnerabilities in real-world federated learning by demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction of sensitive data without requiring domain-specific priors, forcing urgent reassessment of FL privacy safeguards.

We also introduce a local confidence metric correlated with Message Recovery Rate, enhancing the method's practical applicability. This approach bridges the gap between traditional watermarking and passive forensic methods, offering a robust solution for image integrity verification.

Abstract: Reconstruction-based methods, particularly those leveraging autoencoders, have been widely adopted for anomaly detection task in brain MRI. Unlike most existing works try to improve the task accuracy through architectural or algorithmic innovations, we tackle this task from image quality assessment (IQA) perspective, an under-explored direction in the field. Due to the limitations of conventional metrics such as l1 in capturing the nuanced differences in reconstructed images for medical anomaly detection, we propose fusion quality, a novel metric that wisely integrates the structure-level sensitivity of Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) with the pixel-level precision of l1. The metric offers a more comprehensive assessment of reconstruction quality, considering intensity (subtractive property of l1 and divisive property of SSIM), contrast, and structural similarity. Furthermore, the proposed metric makes subtle regional variations more impactful in the final assessment. Thus, considering the inherent divisive properties of SSIM, we design an average intensity ratio (AIR)-based data transformation that amplifies the divisive discrepancies between normal and abnormal regions, thereby enhancing anomaly detection. By fusing the aforementioned two components, we devise the IQA approach. Experimental results on two distinct brain MRI datasets show that our IQA approach significantly enhances medical anomaly detection performance when integrated with state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: With sepsis remaining a leading cause of mortality, early identification of patients with sepsis and those at high risk of death is a challenge of high socioeconomic importance. Given the potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to monitor microcirculatory alterations, we propose a deep learning approach to automated sepsis diagnosis and mortality prediction using a single HSI cube acquired within seconds. In a prospective observational study, we collected HSI data from the palms and fingers of more than 480 intensive care unit patients. Neural networks applied to HSI measurements predicted sepsis and mortality with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) of 0.80 and 0.72, respectively. Performance improved substantially with additional clinical data, reaching AUROCs of 0.94 for sepsis and 0.83 for mortality. We conclude that deep learning-based HSI analysis enables rapid and noninvasive prediction of sepsis and mortality, with a potential clinical value for enhancing diagnosis and treatment.

Abstract: Conventional multi-stage cell tracking approaches rely heavily on detection or segmentation in each frame as a prerequisite, requiring substantial resources for high-quality segmentation masks and increasing the overall prediction time. To address these limitations, we propose CAP, a novel end-to-end one-stage framework that reimagines cell tracking by treating Cell as Point. Unlike traditional methods, CAP eliminates the need for explicit detection or segmentation, instead jointly tracking cells for sequences in one stage by leveraging the inherent correlations among their trajectories. This simplification reduces both labeling requirements and pipeline complexity. However, directly processing the entire sequence in one stage poses challenges related to data imbalance in capturing cell division events and long sequence inference. To solve these challenges, CAP introduces two key innovations: (1) adaptive event-guided (AEG) sampling, which prioritizes cell division events to mitigate the occurrence imbalance of cell events, and (2) the rolling-as-window (RAW) inference strategy, which ensures continuous and stable tracking of newly emerging cells over extended sequences. By removing the dependency on segmentation-based preprocessing while addressing the challenges of imbalanced occurrence of cell events and long-sequence tracking, CAP demonstrates promising cell tracking performance and is 8 to 32 times more efficient than existing methods. The code and model checkpoints will be available soon.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks with task-specific fine-tuning, yet full parameter fine-tuning is often computationally prohibitive for large models. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) reduce this cost by introducing low-rank matrices for tuning fewer parameters. While LoRA allows for efficient fine-tuning, it requires significant data for adaptation, making Federated Learning (FL) an appealing solution due to its privacy-preserving collaborative framework. However, combining LoRA with FL introduces two key challenges: the \textbf{Server-Side Aggregation Bias}, where server-side averaging of LoRA matrices diverges from the ideal global update, and the \textbf{Client-Side Initialization Lag}, emphasizing the need for consistent initialization across rounds. Existing approaches address these challenges individually, limiting their effectiveness. We propose LoRA-FAIR, a novel method that tackles both issues by introducing a correction term on the server, enhancing aggregation efficiency and accuracy. LoRA-FAIR maintains computational and communication efficiency, yielding superior performance over state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results on ViT and MLP-Mixer models across large-scale datasets demonstrate that LoRA-FAIR consistently achieves performance improvements in FL settings.

Abstract: Real-time computer vision (CV) plays a crucial role in various real-world applications, whose performance is highly dependent on communication networks. Nonetheless, the data-oriented characteristics of conventional communications often do not align with the special needs of real-time CV tasks. To alleviate this issue, the recently emerged semantic communications only transmit task-related semantic information and exhibit a promising landscape to address this problem. However, the communication challenges associated with Semantic Facial Editing, one of the most important real-time CV applications on social media, still remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing Editable-DeepSC, a novel cross-modal semantic communication approach for facial editing. Firstly, we theoretically discuss different transmission schemes that separately handle communications and editings, and emphasize the necessity of Joint Editing-Channel Coding (JECC) via iterative attributes matching, which integrates editings into the communication chain to preserve more semantic mutual information. To compactly represent the high-dimensional data, we leverage inversion methods via pre-trained StyleGAN priors for semantic coding. To tackle the dynamic channel noise conditions, we propose SNR-aware channel coding via model fine-tuning. Extensive experiments indicate that Editable-DeepSC can achieve superior editings while significantly saving the transmission bandwidth, even under high-resolution and out-of-distribution (OOD) settings.

Abstract: Many everyday mobile manipulation tasks require precise interaction with small objects, such as grasping a knob to open a cabinet or pressing a light switch. In this paper, we develop Servoing with Vision Models (SVM), a closed-loop framework that enables a mobile manipulator to tackle such precise tasks involving the manipulation of small objects. SVM uses state-of-the-art vision foundation models to generate 3D targets for visual servoing to enable diverse tasks in novel environments. Naively doing so fails because of occlusion by the end-effector. SVM mitigates this using vision models that out-paint the end-effector, thereby significantly enhancing target localization. We demonstrate that aided by out-painting methods, open-vocabulary object detectors can serve as a drop-in module for SVM to seek semantic targets (e.g. knobs) and point tracking methods can help SVM reliably pursue interaction sites indicated by user clicks. We conduct a large-scale evaluation spanning experiments in 10 novel environments across 6 buildings including 72 different object instances. SVM obtains a 71% zero-shot success rate on manipulating unseen objects in novel environments in the real world, outperforming an open-loop control method by an absolute 42% and an imitation learning baseline trained on 1000+ demonstrations also by an absolute success rate of 50%.

Abstract: We propose a demand estimation method that leverages unstructured text and image data to infer substitution patterns. Using pre-trained deep learning models, we extract embeddings from product images and textual descriptions and incorporate them into a random coefficients logit model. This approach enables researchers to estimate demand even when they lack data on product attributes or when consumers value hard-to-quantify attributes, such as visual design or functional benefits. Using data from a choice experiment, we show that our approach outperforms standard attribute-based models in counterfactual predictions of consumers' second choices. We also apply it across 40 product categories on Amazon and consistently find that text and image data help identify close substitutes within each category.

Abstract: Aligning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with safety standards is essential to mitigate risks arising from their multimodal complexity, where integrating vision and language unveils subtle threats beyond the reach of conventional safeguards. Inspired by the insight that reasoning across modalities is key to preempting intricate vulnerabilities, we propose a novel direction for VLM safety: multimodal reasoning-driven prompt rewriting. To this end, we introduce VLMGuard-R1, a proactive framework that refines user inputs through a reasoning-guided rewriter, dynamically interpreting text-image interactions to deliver refined prompts that bolster safety across diverse VLM architectures without altering their core parameters. To achieve this, we devise a three-stage reasoning pipeline to synthesize a dataset that trains the rewriter to infer subtle threats, enabling tailored, actionable responses over generic refusals. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks with five VLMs reveal that VLMGuard-R1 outperforms four baselines. In particular, VLMGuard-R1 achieves a remarkable 43.59\% increase in average safety across five models on the SIUO benchmark.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated notable success in enhancing the reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs), particularly on mathematics and programming tasks. Similar to how traditional RL helps agents explore and learn new strategies, RLVR is believed to enable LLMs to continuously self-improve, thus acquiring novel reasoning abilities beyond those of the corresponding base models. In this study we critically examine the current state of RLVR by systematically probing the reasoning capability boundaries of RLVR-trained LLMs across various model families, RL algorithms, and math, coding, and visual reasoning benchmarks, using pass@k at large k values as the evaluation metric. Surprisingly, we find that the current training setup does not elicit fundamentally new reasoning patterns. While RLVR-trained models outperform their base models at small k (e.g., k = 1), the base models achieve a higher pass@k score when k is large. Coverage and perplexity analyses show that the observed reasoning abilities originate from and are bounded by the base model. Treating the base model as an upper bound, our quantitative analysis shows that six popular RLVR algorithms perform similarly and remain far from optimal in leveraging the potential of the base model. By contrast, we find that distillation can introduce new reasoning patterns from the teacher and genuinely expand the model's reasoning capabilities. Overall, our findings suggest that current RLVR methods have not yet realized the potential of RL to elicit truly novel reasoning abilities in LLMs. This highlights the need for improved RL paradigms, such as continual scaling and multi-turn agent-environment interaction, to unlock this potential.

Abstract: Garment manipulation is a critical challenge due to the diversity in garment categories, geometries, and deformations. Despite this, humans can effortlessly handle garments, thanks to the dexterity of our hands. However, existing research in the field has struggled to replicate this level of dexterity, primarily hindered by the lack of realistic simulations of dexterous garment manipulation. Therefore, we propose DexGarmentLab, the first environment specifically designed for dexterous (especially bimanual) garment manipulation, which features large-scale high-quality 3D assets for 15 task scenarios, and refines simulation techniques tailored for garment modeling to reduce the sim-to-real gap. Previous data collection typically relies on teleoperation or training expert reinforcement learning (RL) policies, which are labor-intensive and inefficient. In this paper, we leverage garment structural correspondence to automatically generate a dataset with diverse trajectories using only a single expert demonstration, significantly reducing manual intervention. However, even extensive demonstrations cannot cover the infinite states of garments, which necessitates the exploration of new algorithms. To improve generalization across diverse garment shapes and deformations, we propose a Hierarchical gArment-manipuLation pOlicy (HALO). It first identifies transferable affordance points to accurately locate the manipulation area, then generates generalizable trajectories to complete the task. Through extensive experiments and detailed analysis of our method and baseline, we demonstrate that HALO consistently outperforms existing methods, successfully generalizing to previously unseen instances even with significant variations in shape and deformation where others fail.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has traditionally relied on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models. CNNs, however, are constrained by limited receptive fields, while Transformers face scalability challenges due to quadratic computational complexity. To over-come these issues, recent studies have explored alternative architectures. The Mamba model, a selective state-space design, achieves near-linear complexity and effectively captures long-range dependencies. Its vision-oriented variant, the Visual State Space (VSS) model, extends these strengths to image feature learning. In parallel, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) enhanc-es nonlinear expressiveness by replacing fixed activation functions with learnable ones. Moti-vated by these advances, we propose the VSS-Enhanced KAN (VKAN) module, which integrates VSS with the Expanded Field Convolutional KAN (EFC-KAN) as a replacement for Transformer modules, thereby strengthening feature extraction. We further embed VKAN into a U-Net frame-work, resulting in MedVKAN, an efficient medical image segmentation model. Extensive exper-iments on five public datasets demonstrate that MedVKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets and ranks second on the remaining one. These results underscore the effective-ness of combining Mamba and KAN while introducing a novel and computationally efficient feature extraction framework.

<title>Breaking the Compression Ceiling: Data-Free Pipeline for Ultra-Efficient Delta Compression</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13563</link>

arXiv:2505.13563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rise of the fine-tuned-pretrained paradigm, storing numerous fine-tuned models for multi-tasking creates significant storage overhead. Delta compression alleviates this by storing only the pretrained model and the highly compressed delta weights (the differences between fine-tuned and pretrained model weights). However, existing methods fail to maintain both high compression and performance, and often rely on data. To address these challenges, we propose UltraDelta, the first data-free delta compression pipeline that achieves both ultra-high compression and strong performance. UltraDelta is designed to minimize redundancy, maximize information, and stabilize performance across inter-layer, intra-layer, and global dimensions, using three key components: (1) Variance-Based Mixed Sparsity Allocation assigns sparsity based on variance, giving lower sparsity to high-variance layers to preserve inter-layer information. (2) Distribution-Aware Compression applies uniform quantization and then groups parameters by value, followed by group-wise pruning, to better preserve intra-layer distribution. (3) Trace-Norm-Guided Rescaling uses the trace norm of delta weights to estimate a global rescaling factor, improving model stability under higher compression. Extensive experiments across (a) large language models (fine-tuned on LLaMA-2 7B and 13B) with up to 50x compression, (b) general NLP models (RoBERTa-base, T5-base) with up to 224x compression, (c) vision models (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14) with up to 132x compression, and (d) multi-modal models (BEiT-3) with 18x compression, demonstrate that UltraDelta consistently outperforms existing methods, especially under ultra-high compression.

<title>OSCAR: One-Step Diffusion Codec Across Multiple Bit-rates</title>

Abstract: Pretrained latent diffusion models have shown strong potential for lossy image compression, owing to their powerful generative priors. Most existing diffusion-based methods reconstruct images by iteratively denoising from random noise, guided by compressed latent representations. While these approaches have achieved high reconstruction quality, their multi-step sampling process incurs substantial computational overhead. Moreover, they typically require training separate models for different compression bit-rates, leading to significant training and storage costs. To address these challenges, we propose a one-step diffusion codec across multiple bit-rates. termed OSCAR. Specifically, our method views compressed latents as noisy variants of the original latents, where the level of distortion depends on the bit-rate. This perspective allows them to be modeled as intermediate states along a diffusion trajectory. By establishing a mapping from the compression bit-rate to a pseudo diffusion timestep, we condition a single generative model to support reconstructions at multiple bit-rates. Meanwhile, we argue that the compressed latents retain rich structural information, thereby making one-step denoising feasible. Thus, OSCAR replaces iterative sampling with a single denoising pass, significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSCAR achieves superior performance in both quantitative and visual quality metrics. The code and models are available at https://github.com/jp-guo/OSCAR.

<title>Shifting AI Efficiency From Model-Centric to Data-Centric Compression</title>

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) has historically relied on scaling model parameters. However, as hardware limits constrain further model growth, the primary computational bottleneck has shifted to the quadratic cost of self-attention over increasingly long sequences by ultra-long text contexts, high-resolution images, and extended videos. In this position paper, \textbf{we argue that the focus of research for efficient artificial intelligence (AI) is shifting from model-centric compression to data-centric compression}. We position data-centric compression as the emerging paradigm, which improves AI efficiency by directly compressing the volume of data processed during model training or inference. To formalize this shift, we establish a unified framework for existing efficiency strategies and demonstrate why it constitutes a crucial paradigm change for long-context AI. We then systematically review the landscape of data-centric compression methods, analyzing their benefits across diverse scenarios. Finally, we outline key challenges and promising future research directions. Our work aims to provide a novel perspective on AI efficiency, synthesize existing efforts, and catalyze innovation to address the challenges posed by ever-increasing context lengths.

Abstract: Differentiable optics, as an emerging paradigm that jointly optimizes optics and (optional) image processing algorithms, has made innovative optical designs possible across a broad range of applications. Many of these systems utilize diffractive optical components (DOEs) for holography, PSF engineering, or wavefront shaping. Existing approaches have, however, mostly remained limited to laboratory prototypes, owing to a large quality gap between simulation and manufactured devices. We aim at lifting the fundamental technical barriers to the practical use of learned diffractive optical systems. To this end, we propose a fabrication-aware design pipeline for diffractive optics fabricated by direct-write grayscale lithography followed by nano-imprinting replication, which is directly suited for inexpensive mass production of large area designs. We propose a super-resolved neural lithography model that can accurately predict the 3D geometry generated by the fabrication process. This model can be seamlessly integrated into existing differentiable optics frameworks, enabling fabrication-aware, end-to-end optimization of computational optical systems. To tackle the computational challenges, we also devise tensor-parallel compute framework centered on distributing large-scale FFT computation across many GPUs. As such, we demonstrate large scale diffractive optics designs up to 32.16 mm $\times$ 21.44 mm, simulated on grids of up to 128,640 by 85,760 feature points. We find adequate agreement between simulation and fabricated prototypes for applications such as holography and PSF engineering. We also achieve high image quality from an imaging system comprised only of a single DOE, with images processed only by a Wiener filter utilizing the simulation PSF. We believe our findings lift the fabrication limitations for real-world applications of diffractive optics and differentiable optical design.

Abstract: Unified generation models aim to handle diverse tasks across modalities -- such as text generation, image generation, and vision-language reasoning -- within a single architecture and decoding paradigm. Autoregressive unified models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch, Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) renders pixels by rasterizing Gaussian primitives, where conditional alpha-blending dominates the computational cost in the rendering pipeline. This paper proposes TC-GS, an algorithm-independent universal module that expands the applicability of Tensor Core (TCU) for 3DGS, leading to substantial speedups and seamless integration into existing 3DGS optimization frameworks. The key innovation lies in mapping alpha computation to matrix multiplication, fully utilizing otherwise idle TCUs in existing 3DGS implementations. TC-GS provides plug-and-play acceleration for existing top-tier acceleration algorithms and integrates seamlessly with rendering pipeline designs, such as Gaussian compression and redundancy elimination algorithms. Additionally, we introduce a global-to-local coordinate transformation to mitigate rounding errors from quadratic terms of pixel coordinates caused by Tensor Core half-precision computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains rendering quality while providing an additional 2.18x speedup over existing Gaussian acceleration algorithms, thereby achieving a total acceleration of up to 5.6x.

<title>Tversky Neural Networks: Psychologically Plausible Deep Learning with Differentiable Tversky Similarity</title>

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception of similarity. In contrast, Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity with psychological plausibility based on a representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a function of their common and distinctive features. This model of similarity has not been used in deep learning before, in part because of the challenge of incorporating discrete set operations. In this paper, we develop a differentiable parameterization of Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive basic neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR. Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling neural networks, we show that the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear projection layer. For instance, on the NABirds image classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases by 7.8%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified interpretation of both types of projection layers as computing similarities of input stimuli to learned prototypes for which we also propose a novel visualization technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in modern deep learning, and designing neural networks that are interpretable under an established theory of psychological similarity.

<title>TAG-WM: Tamper-Aware Generative Image Watermarking via Diffusion Inversion Sensitivity</title>

Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) enables efficient visual creation but raises copyright and authenticity risks. As a common technique for integrity verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a potential solution to above issues. However, the widespread adoption and advancing capabilities of generative image editing tools have amplified malicious tampering risks, while simultaneously posing new challenges to passive tampering detection and watermark robustness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The experimental results demonstrate that TAG-WM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tampering robustness and localization capability even under distortion, while preserving lossless generation quality and maintaining a watermark capacity of 256 bits. The code is available at: https://github.com/Suchenl/TAG-WM.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) methods have gained significant attention for enhancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP during inference, without requiring additional labeled data. However, current TTA researches generally suffer from major limitations such as duplication of baseline results, limited evaluation metrics, inconsistent experimental settings, and insufficient analysis. These problems hinder fair comparisons between TTA methods and make it difficult to assess their practical strengths and weaknesses. To address these challenges, we introduce TTA-VLM, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating TTA methods on VLMs. Our benchmark implements 8 episodic TTA and 7 online TTA methods within a unified and reproducible framework, and evaluates them across 15 widely used datasets. Unlike prior studies focused solely on CLIP, we extend the evaluation to SigLIP--a model trained with a Sigmoid loss--and include training-time tuning methods such as CoOp, MaPLe, and TeCoA to assess generality. Beyond classification accuracy, TTA-VLM incorporates various evaluation metrics, including robustness, calibration, out-of-distribution detection, and stability, enabling a more holistic assessment of TTA methods. Through extensive experiments, we find that 1) existing TTA methods produce limited gains compared to the previous pioneering work; 2) current TTA methods exhibit poor collaboration with training-time fine-tuning methods; 3) accuracy gains frequently come at the cost of reduced model trustworthiness. We release TTA-VLM to provide fair comparison and comprehensive evaluation of TTA methods for VLMs, and we hope it encourages the community to develop more reliable and generalizable TTA strategies.

Abstract: Diffusion models can be improved with additional guidance towards more effective representations of input. Indeed, prior empirical work has already shown that aligning internal representations of the diffusion model with those of pre-trained models improves generation quality. In this paper, we present a systematic framework for incorporating representation guidance into diffusion models. We provide alternative decompositions of denoising models along with their associated training criteria, where the decompositions determine when and how the auxiliary representations are incorporated. Guided by our theoretical insights, we introduce two new strategies for enhancing representation alignment in diffusion models. First, we pair examples with target representations either derived from themselves or arisen from different synthetic modalities, and subsequently learn a joint model over the multimodal pairs. Second, we design an optimal training curriculum that balances representation learning and data generation. Our experiments across image, protein sequence, and molecule generation tasks demonstrate superior performance as well as accelerated training. In particular, on the class-conditional ImageNet $256\times 256$ benchmark, our guidance results in $23.3$ times faster training than the original SiT-XL as well as four times speedup over the state-of-the-art method REPA.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning with vision-language models (VLMs) often suffers from hallucinations, as models tend to generate explanations after only a superficial inspection of the image. We present \textbf{CoRGI}(\textbf{C}hain \textbf{o}f \textbf{R}easoning with \textbf{G}rounded \textbf{I}nsights), a framework that enhances reasoning reliability through post-hoc verification of chain-of-thought outputs. Given a VLM-generated rationale, CoRGI decomposes it into step-wise statements, grounds each step in visual evidence, and filters or corrects unsupported claims before producing the final answer. Experiments on five challenging benchmark-VCR, ScienceQA, MMMU, MathVista, and HallusionBenc-demonstrate that CoRGI consistently improves both answer accuracy and explanation faithfulness across multiple VLM backbones, including Qwen-2.5VL, LLaVA-1.6, and Gemma3-12B. Beyond quantitative gains, qualitative analyses further illustrate how the verification process reduces hallucination and strengthens interpretability, suggesting that post-hoc visual grounding is a promising direction for building more trustworthy and transparent multimodal reasoning systems.

Abstract: Despite their strong performance in multimodal emotion reasoning, existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often overlook the scenarios involving emotion conflicts, where emotional cues from different modalities are inconsistent. To fill this gap, we first introduce CA-MER, a new benchmark designed to examine MLLMs under realistic emotion conflicts. It consists of three subsets: video-aligned, audio-aligned, and consistent, where only one or all modalities reflect the true emotion. However, evaluations on our CA-MER reveal that current state-of-the-art emotion MLLMs systematically over-rely on audio signal during emotion conflicts, neglecting critical cues from visual modality. To mitigate this bias, we propose MoSEAR, a parameter-efficient framework that promotes balanced modality integration. MoSEAR consists of two modules: (1)MoSE, modality-specific experts with a regularized gating mechanism that reduces modality bias in the fine-tuning heads; and (2)AR, an attention reallocation mechanism that rebalances modality contributions in frozen backbones during inference. Our framework offers two key advantages: it mitigates emotion conflicts and improves performance on consistent samples-without incurring a trade-off between audio and visual modalities. Experiments on multiple benchmarks-including MER2023, EMER, DFEW, and our CA-MER-demonstrate that MoSEAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly under modality conflict conditions.

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. To address these issues, we propose CcGAN-AVAR, an enhanced CcGAN framework featuring (1) two novel components for handling data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism that dynamically adjusts vicinity size and a multi-task discriminator that enhances generator training through auxiliary regression and density ratio estimation - and (2) the GAN framework's native one-step generator, enable 30x-2000x faster inference than CCDM. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 256x256 resolution) across eleven challenging settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

<title>Audio Does Matter: Importance-Aware Multi-Granularity Fusion for Video Moment Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) aims to retrieve a specific moment semantically related to the given query. To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods solely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the complementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to tackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally and simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval. These designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video moment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or background sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end, we propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which learns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts for VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and audio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance predictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly assigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we design a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and visual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their complementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation strategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference. To evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e., Charades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and re-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability in utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art with audio-video fusion in VMR methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/IMG.

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations. However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces. Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot, demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning framework designed to enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, with a focus on improving precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images, depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and effective solution for object handling.

Abstract: Predicting the success of start-up companies, defined as achieving an exit through acquisition or IPO, is a critical problem in entrepreneurship and innovation research. Datasets such as Crunchbase provide both structured information (e.g., funding rounds, industries, investor networks) and unstructured text (e.g., company descriptions), but effectively leveraging this heterogeneous data for prediction remains challenging. Traditional machine learning approaches often rely only on structured features and achieve moderate accuracy, while large language models (LLMs) offer rich reasoning abilities but struggle to adapt directly to domain-specific business data. We present \textbf{CrunchLLM}, a domain-adapted LLM framework for startup success prediction. CrunchLLM integrates structured company attributes with unstructured textual narratives and applies parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies alongside prompt optimization to specialize foundation models for entrepreneurship data. Our approach achieves accuracy exceeding 80\% on Crunchbase startup success prediction, significantly outperforming traditional classifiers and baseline LLMs. Beyond predictive performance, CrunchLLM provides interpretable reasoning traces that justify its predictions, enhancing transparency and trustworthiness for financial and policy decision makers. This work demonstrates how adapting LLMs with domain-aware fine-tuning and structured--unstructured data fusion can advance predictive modeling of entrepreneurial outcomes. CrunchLLM contributes a methodological framework and a practical tool for data-driven decision making in venture capital and innovation policy.

<title>Prompt Optimization Meets Subspace Representation Learning for Few-shot Out-of-Distribution Detection</title>

Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in open-world settings depends heavily on their ability to flag out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs unseen during training. Recent advances in large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled promising few-shot OOD detection frameworks using only a handful of in-distribution (ID) samples. However, existing prompt learning-based OOD methods rely solely on softmax probabilities, overlooking the rich discriminative potential of the feature embeddings learned by VLMs trained on millions of samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel context optimization (CoOp)-based framework that integrates subspace representation learning with prompt tuning. Our approach improves ID-OOD separability by projecting the ID features into a subspace spanned by prompt vectors, while projecting ID-irrelevant features into an orthogonal null space. To train such OOD detection framework, we design an easy-to-handle end-to-end learning criterion that ensures strong OOD detection performance as well as high ID classification accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets showcase the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths. Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior, acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes. This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction structure.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Large Language Models, visual token pruning, efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, HoloV, global visual context

Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges faced by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to the computational overhead caused by massive visual tokens. Existing token pruning methods focus on attention-first approaches, which may lead to a drop in performance at high pruning ratios. In response, the proposed HoloV framework offers a more holistic approach to visual token pruning. By distributing the pruning budget across spatial crops, HoloV ensures global visual context retention, minimizing information loss even with aggressive pruning. Experimental results show that HoloV outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios. For example, utilizing HoloV, LLaVA1.5 maintains 95.8% of original performance after pruning 88.9% of visual tokens, striking a more efficient balance between accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or [\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops, HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Brain cancer affects millions worldwide, and in nearly every clinical setting, doctors rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose and monitor gliomas. However, the current standard for tumor quantification through manual segmentation of multi-parametric MRI is time-consuming, requires expert radiologists, and is often infeasible in under-resourced healthcare systems. This problem is especially pronounced in low-income regions, where MRI scanners are of lower quality and radiology expertise is scarce, leading to incorrect segmentation and quantification. In addition, the number of acquired MRI scans in Africa is typically small. To address these challenges, the BraTS-Lighthouse 2025 Challenge focuses on robust tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where resource constraints and image quality degradation introduce significant shifts. In this study, we present EMedNeXt -- an enhanced brain tumor segmentation framework based on MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision and optimized post-processing pipelines tailored for SSA. EMedNeXt introduces three key contributions: a larger region of interest, an improved nnU-Net v2-based architectural skeleton, and a robust model ensembling system. Evaluated on the hidden validation set, our solution achieved an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897 with an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at a tolerance of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively.

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area, we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub, enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

Summary:
- Text-to-image diffusion models are powerful but prone to memorizing and replicating training data, leading to privacy and copyright issues.
- Memorization is attributed to attraction basins, prompting delays in applying classifier-free guidance (CFG).
- Delaying CFG application results in poorly aligned non-memorized images.
- The initial noise sample significantly influences escape times from attraction basins.
- Proposed mitigation strategies adjust initial noise samples to encourage earlier escape and reduce memorization while maintaining image-text alignment.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However, such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

Summary: 
This study explores representation biases in AI-generated images in an occupational setting, comparing the performance of two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram. The research reveals that both tools tend to reinforce traditional gender stereotypes in the generated images. Over 750 AI-generated images of occupations were analyzed, with findings indicating the presence of biases in the visual representations. The study highlights the importance of addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases in AI visualisation tools to ensure diversity in media and professional contexts. The results underscore the risk of narrow representations perpetuated by AI image generators. Suggestions are provided for practitioners, individuals, and researchers to enhance gender representation in generated images, promoting inclusivity and equality. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram, compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used, addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over 750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations. In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners, individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images with visible genders.

<div> Keywords: LiDAR point clouds, out-of-distribution detection, unsupervised learning, epistemic uncertainty, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

Summary: 
An unsupervised approach for detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) objects in LiDAR point clouds is introduced in this study. The method utilizes epistemic uncertainty derived from hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters within the feature space of a deep neural network. By differentiating between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, the model effectively distinguishes OOD objects from ambiguous in-distribution regions. The approach does not require additional data or training stages, outperforming existing uncertainty-based methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset. Results show significant improvements, with an 18% increase in AUROC, a 22% rise in AUPRC, and a 36% reduction in FPR95 compared to previous predictive entropy-based approaches. This advancement in OOD detection is crucial for accurate scene understanding and preventing misclassifications of unknown objects. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC, 22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%), compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

Summary:
The article introduces a new approach to Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier known as Hi-OSCAR. It addresses the challenge of handling unseen activities in HAR datasets by structuring activity classes into a hierarchy. Hi-OSCAR can accurately identify known activities while rejecting unknown ones, enabling open-set classification. The classifier also localizes unknown classes to the nearest internal node, providing additional insight. To support open-set HAR research, the authors have collected a new dataset called NFI_FARED, which includes data from multiple subjects performing nineteen activities across different contexts. The dataset is publicly available for download. This research aims to bridge the gap between the diverse range of activities performed in real life and the limitations of existing annotated sensor datasets used in training, ultimately improving the reliability and accuracy of HAR classifiers.

arXiv:2510.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability. Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown" classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and available for download.

Summary:<br />
High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a valuable biomarker for identifying the epileptogenic zone, and mapping HFO-generating regions can improve precision in epilepsy surgery. This study introduces a novel automated method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands using an unsupervised clustering technique with the S-transform. The method showed high sensitivity (97.67%), precision (98.57%), and F-score (97.78%) on controlled datasets and demonstrated a strong correlation with surgical outcomes in epilepsy patients. The results confirmed HFOs as promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity, with seizure freedom achieved by removing HFOs, particularly fast ripple, and seizure recurrence associated with remaining HFOs. Automated detection of HFOs is crucial for research and clinical applications, providing a more efficient and objective approach compared to manual visual identification, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes in epilepsy surgery. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.08637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined. Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500 Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity, and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients. Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

<div> Keywords: DINOv2, Linear Representation Hypothesis, SAEs, functional specialization, Minkowski Representation Hypothesis

Summary:
The study explores the nature of object recognition by deploying DINOv2 and using the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH). Through the analysis of downstream tasks, functional specialization is revealed, with classification utilizing "Elsewhere" concepts, segmentation relying on boundary detectors, and depth estimation drawing on various depth cues. The geometry and statistics of concepts learned by SAEs show dense representations evolving towards greater coherence. Tokens are found to be formed by combining convex mixtures of archetypes, suggesting a departure from linear sparsity alone. The proposed Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) posits that tokens are defined by convex mixtures of archetypes, grounded in conceptual spaces. Empirical signatures of MRH are examined, with implications for interpreting vision-transformer representations. <div>

As a working baseline, we adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization: classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors' conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer representations.

<div> Keywords: remote sensing, image restoration, degradation, physics-guided, computational efficiency

Summary:
PhyDAE is a novel approach for remote sensing image restoration that addresses the challenges posed by complex and heterogeneous degradations. It utilizes a two-stage cascaded architecture to transform implicit degradation information into explicit decision signals, allowing for precise identification and differentiated processing of various degradation factors such as haze, noise, blur, and low-light conditions. The model incorporates degradation mining mechanisms like the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) to analyze degradation characteristics comprehensively. Physics-aware expert modules and sparse activation strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while maintaining imaging physics consistency. PhyDAE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in restoration tasks on benchmark datasets, achieving superior performance, reduced parameter count, and computational complexity. It strikes an optimal balance between performance and efficiency, making significant efficiency gains compared to existing approaches. The code is available for implementation.

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts (PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals, enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives. Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video, leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility. Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M) samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful clinical AI.

<div> Keywords: camera-centric multimodal model, spatial intelligence, vision-language, spatial generation, Puffin-4M dataset

Summary: 
Puffin is a unified camera-centric multimodal model designed to enhance spatial awareness and generation by integrating language regression and diffusion-based generation. By treating the camera as language, Puffin aligns visual cues with photographic terminology and reasons across geometric contexts. Trained on the Puffin-4M dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets, Puffin incorporates global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps for flexible spatial generation. Experimental results show Puffin outperforms specialized models for camera-centric generation and understanding. Through instruction tuning, Puffin is able to generalize to various cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and photography guidance. The researchers plan to release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and benchmark to further advance multimodal spatial intelligence research. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets. We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps, yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

Summary:
Structured Output Regularization (SOR) is proposed as a framework for transfer learning that freezes internal network structures while incorporating group lasso and $L_1 penalties. This approach allows models to adapt to domain-specific features with minimal additional parameters and can be applied to various network components. In three few-shot medical imaging classification tasks, SOR yielded competitive results using DenseNet121 and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established benchmarks. SOR offers a computationally efficient solution that mitigates overfitting and enhances the model's ability to learn from limited data, making it a valuable tool for transfer learning tasks in medical imaging. <div>

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization (SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established benchmarks.

<div> benchmark, embodied capabilities, multimodal large language models, BEAR, BEAR-Agent

Summary:
The article introduces a new benchmark called BEAR that evaluates the embodied capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across various domains. BEAR consists of tasks ranging from low-level pointing to high-level planning, covering 14 domains in 6 categories. Evaluation of 20 MLLMs on BEAR reveals persistent limitations in their embodied capabilities. To address these limitations, the authors propose BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that enhances MLLM performance by integrating pretrained vision models. This approach leads to a substantial improvement in MLLM performance on BEAR, with a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. The experiments also suggest that enhancing MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit tasks in simulated environments. The findings underscore the importance of evaluating and improving the embodied capabilities of MLLMs for better performance on a wide range of tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across 14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

<div> Keywords: adversarial attacks, deep learning models, biological mechanisms, reinforcement learning, ImageNet dataset

Summary: 
This article introduces a novel defense framework inspired by biological mechanisms to enhance the robustness of deep learning models against adversarial attacks. The proposed approach incorporates foveal-peripheral processing, saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in to selectively capture multiple foveal-peripheral glimpses using reinforcement learning-guided saccades. By integrating these glimpses into a reconstructed image before classification, the method effectively mitigates adversarial noise and maintains semantic integrity without the need for retraining downstream classifiers. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate the framework's ability to improve system robustness across various classifiers and attack types while reducing training overhead compared to existing defense techniques. This innovative approach shows promise for enhancing the security of deep learning models in real-world applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing, saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces LinearSR, a framework for Image Super-Resolution that utilizes Linear Attention to overcome the computational bottleneck of self-attention models. The authors developed an Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning strategy to address training instability issues and implemented a Mixture of Experts architecture to balance perception-distortion trade-offs. They also introduced a guidance paradigm called TAG based on precision-over-volume principles. The resulting LinearSR model achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency, featuring a diffusion forward pass with SOTA-level speed. This work paves the way for using Linear Attention in photorealistic SR applications, setting a foundation for future research in efficient generative super-resolution.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.08771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful, yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time, systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF) strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our "precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future research in efficient generative super-resolution.

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification, however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a} re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and conservation biology.

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content (AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video, highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems. Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts, showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation models.

Summary:
The framework proposed in this study addresses challenges in Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) through three key contributions. Firstly, a unified solution for aligning heterogeneous modalities across multiple levels and stages is introduced, utilizing contrastive learning and optimal transport theory. Secondly, a hard negative mining method with soft labels is implemented to enhance multi-modality alignments and discrimination of hard negative pairs. Lastly, a Gated Cross-Attention Module is developed to integrate answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and select relevant information. The framework surpasses previous state-of-the-art results on popular Med-VQA datasets such as RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA, and VQA-2019. <div>
arXiv:2510.08791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions. Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP) have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels, modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces SkipSR, a framework for accelerating video super-resolution by identifying low-detail regions from low-resolution inputs and skipping computation on them. By only super-resolving areas that require refinement, SkipSR significantly reduces computation while maintaining perceptual quality in both standard and one-step diffusion SR models. The method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency on 720p videos without any perceived loss in quality. This approach allows for scalability to higher resolutions and longer videos by focusing computational resources on areas that benefit from refinement, rather than processing all pixels uniformly. Video demos of SkipSR's performance are available for further exploration. <div>
arXiv:2510.08799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality.

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks.

<div> Keywords: 3D instance segmentation, open-vocabulary, knowledge distillation, ScanNet200, Replica

Summary:
Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation aims to classify instances beyond annotated labels by avoiding the use of 2D mappings that introduce noise and slow down inference. The Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided Knowledge distillation (FOLK) introduces a teacher model to distill open-vocabulary knowledge into a 3D student model, enabling direct instance classification from 3D point clouds. A 2D CLIP embedding is generated by the teacher model for each 3D instance, serving as the distillation target. A 3D student model produces 3D embeddings for instances, and label-guided distillation is used to transfer knowledge from 2D embeddings to the student model. FOLK outperforms existing methods on the ScanNet200 dataset with an AP50 score of 35.7 and achieves significantly faster inference speeds. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach, with all codes to be released post-acceptance.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from 2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled 3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

<div> Keywords: cranberry farming, change monitoring, deep learning, vision transformers, self-supervised approach

Summary:
This article introduces a method for change monitoring in cranberry farming using deep learning techniques. Traditional manual monitoring methods are time-consuming, so the proposed method aims to automate the process using vision transformers (ViTs) and a self-supervised approach. By fine-tuning ViTs with a two-fold pretext task, the method learns a latent space for the evolution of plant and fruit appearance over time. This allows for the prediction of growth and the distinction of temporal differences among cranberry varieties. A new time-lapse dataset of cranberry fruit, featuring eight varieties observed 52 times over four months, is provided, annotated with relevant information. The approach is generalizable to other crops and applications and the code and dataset are available on GitHub for further exploration.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield, and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually, requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task (time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github. com/ronan-39/tlt/).

<div> hierarchical structure, compositionality, vision-language models, hyperbolic space, multi-modal representation learning

Summary: 
The article discusses the limitations of current vision-language models in expressing both hierarchical structures within concept families and compositional relationships across different concept families. To address this challenge, the authors propose PHyCLIP, a model that utilizes an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic factors. This design allows for the emergence of intra-family hierarchies within individual factors and captures cross-family compositionality through the $\ell_1$-product metric. Experimental results demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing single-space approaches in tasks such as zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and compositional understanding. Additionally, PHyCLIP offers more interpretable structures in the embedding space, showcasing its effectiveness in capturing complex semantic relationships in multi-modal representation learning. <div>

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family (e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP, which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the $\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the embedding space.

<div> transfer attack, segmentation models, adversarial examples, SegTrans, computational efficiency

Summary:<br />
Researchers have developed a novel transfer attack framework, SegTrans, to enhance the transferability of adversarial examples in segmentation models. The framework divides input samples into local regions and remaps their semantic information to generate diverse enhanced samples, which are used for perturbation optimization. Unlike existing methods, SegTrans focuses on retaining local semantic information rather than global semantic information for perturbation optimization. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and segmentation models demonstrate that SegTrans significantly improves transfer attack success rates and computational efficiency. It achieves an average increase of 8.55% in transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by over 100% compared to current state-of-the-art methods. <div>
arXiv:2510.08922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes, four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than 100%.

<div> image restoration, knowledge distillation, defense, adaptive singular value perturbation, deep learning <br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces a defense mechanism, Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), designed specifically for image restoration models to counter knowledge distillation attacks. ASVP disrupts the alignment needed for distillation by injecting structured, high-frequency perturbations into the internal feature maps of the teacher model using singular value decomposition. This method hinders student learning while maintaining the quality of the teacher's output. Experimental results across various image restoration tasks, including super-resolution and dehazing, demonstrate that ASVP can significantly reduce the student's PSNR and SSIM metrics without affecting the teacher's performance. Compared to existing methods, ASVP provides a more robust and consistent defense against knowledge distillation attacks, offering a practical solution to safeguard open-source restoration models from unauthorized model replication. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.08925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient, as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks: super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by 60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from unauthorized knowledge distillation.

Summary:
An object-focused data augmentation framework is proposed for animal health monitoring in data-constrained settings. The framework segments animals from backgrounds and augments them using transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to improve animal detection and monitoring performance. This strategy addresses the limited data availability and scene-specific challenges faced in aerial drone-based animal health monitoring. Initial experiments show that the augmented dataset outperforms baseline models in animal detection. By generating domain-specific data, this approach enables real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios. This method bridges the gap between limited data and practical applicability, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of agricultural operations using integrated monitoring systems. <div>
arXiv:2510.08955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small, occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds, environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios, bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

<div> Perception-Time Scaling, visual estimation tasks, LVLMs, inference-time scaling, reinforcement learning  
Summary:  
The article introduces DisTANCE, a benchmark for visual estimation tasks, revealing limited precision in current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inference-time scaling strategies offer only marginal benefits due to the one-shot output nature of LVLMs' visual understanding. To address this, Perception-Time Scaling (PTS) is proposed, encouraging token-rich perception and breaking down complex perception tasks into manageable sub-problems. PTS, combined with reinforcement learning, significantly improves perception accuracy, enhancing high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7% and demonstrating generalizability to various tasks. Remarkably, synthetic PTS data combined with math reasoning data show gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Analysis reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and enhances model attention to image tokens. The code and data for this research will be publicly available.  
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks. Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%, and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

<br />
In the paper, the authors propose a framework called mmJoints to enhance the output of a pre-trained mmWave-based 3D pose estimator by including joint descriptors that estimate the likelihood of joint sensing and the reliability of predicted joint locations. This approach aims to address the issue of models relying too heavily on statistical priors rather than sensor data. Through extensive evaluations across various pose estimation settings, the authors demonstrate that mmJoints can estimate joint descriptors with a low error rate and improve joint position accuracy by up to 12.5%. Furthermore, they show that using mmJoints can boost activity recognition accuracy by up to 16% compared to state-of-the-art methods. The framework not only enhances interpretability but also improves performance in downstream tasks, making it a promising approach for mmWave-based pose estimation.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations, over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below 4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications. However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval - HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment. Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a novel hand quality assessment task aimed at improving details in text-to-image models, particularly focusing on human hands. The HandPair dataset is created to train models for assessing hand quality, using high- and low-quality hand pairs for efficient supervision. The HandEval model is designed to evaluate hand quality by leveraging Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and prior knowledge of hand keypoints. It outperforms existing methods in aligning with human judgments. The model is integrated into image generation and artificial image generation and curation (AIGC) detection pipelines, enhancing generated hand realism and detection accuracy. This work highlights the importance of assessing quality in specific regions of generated images, providing a valuable tool for improving visual fidelity in complex local regions. <br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

Summary: 
The article introduces a defensive paradigm called Uncolorable Examples to prevent unauthorized colorization of grayscale images, which can lead to copyright infringement. The method, Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), embeds imperceptible perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. Four criteria - effectiveness, imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness - are established to ensure the real-world applicability of the method. PAChroma optimizes imperceptible perturbations with a Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality and applies diverse input transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models and robustness against common post-processing. Experiments on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets show that PAChroma effectively degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This research is a crucial step towards protecting visual content from illegitimate AI colorization and opens up avenues for copyright-aware defenses in generative media. <br /> <div>

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness, imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance.

<div> denoising, text-to-image models, autoregressive, parallel token generation, inference

Summary:
The article introduces Speculative Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2) as a framework to improve the efficiency of autoregressive text-to-image models. This new method incorporates denoising into Jacobi iterations, allowing for parallel token generation in models. By predicting next clean tokens through fine-tuning with noise-perturbed token embeddings, the denoising paradigm guides the model towards more stable trajectories. During inference, SJD2 initializes token sequences with Gaussian noise and iteratively predicts next clean tokens in the embedding space. A probabilistic criterion is used to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, refining unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that SJD2 can accelerate image generation by reducing model forward passes while maintaining high visual quality in the generated images.

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory. Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

<div> Keywords: Large vision-language models, object hallucination, epistemic uncertainty, adversarial perturbations, mitigation strategy

Summary:
Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have seen success but face challenges such as object hallucination, where descriptions of non-existent objects are generated. The study suggests that uncertain visual tokens in the vision encoder (VE) contribute to hallucinations. High epistemic uncertainty in visual tokens correlates with hallucinations. Visual tokens in early VE layers showing large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations indicate high uncertainty. A simple strategy is proposed to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the VE. The method efficiently identifies uncertain visual tokens using adversarial perturbations and masks them during the self-attention process in middle VE layers to reduce their influence on visual encoding and alleviate hallucinations. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach effectively reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can complement existing methods. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE) with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other prior arts.

Summary:
Dynamic temperature control based on spatial entropy improves content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural coherence in autoregressive image generation models without additional computational cost. Entropy-informed acceptance rules in speculative decoding enable near-lossless generation at 85% of the inference cost compared to conventional methods. The proposed method enhances generation quality and sampling speed in AR image generation models across various benchmarks. <div>
arXiv:2510.09012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive (AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution. Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed. Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding, achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation quality and sampling speed.

<div> generalization, LiDAR, segmentation, noisy labels, domain shift

Summary:
The paper introduces the task of Domain Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL) to address the challenges of noisy annotations in LiDAR data. Existing noisy-label learning strategies from image classification are adapted to 3D segmentation, but they prove ineffective. A novel dual-view framework called DuNe is proposed, with strong and weak branches to enforce feature-level consistency and apply confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and 52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% label noise. Overall, the approach demonstrates robustness in domain generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation tasks. The code for the proposed approach is available on the project page. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL) and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data. We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and 52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is available on our project page.

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel post-training framework for latent diffusion models in medical image-to-image translation, focusing on maintaining pixel-level detail crucial for high-fidelity medical images and enhancing lesion delineation. The proposed framework incorporates lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives, improving overall image quality and precision of lesion reconstruction. Evaluating the framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation for acute ischemic stroke patients, the study demonstrates enhanced image quality and improved lesion delineation compared to existing models. The approach shows promise for improving diagnostic reliability and clinical decision-making in medical imaging tasks, with potential for broader applications across diverse medical image translation challenges. The research highlights the importance of detail preservation in generating clinically significant structures and showcases the potential of post-training strategies in enhancing the performance of image-to-image translation models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.09056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817 patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models. Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse medical image translation tasks.

<div> Framework, Microelectrode implantation, Anomaly detection, Vision transformer, Image analysis

Summary:
The paper presents an image-based anomaly detection framework for flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into the brain cortex. The framework utilizes microscopic cameras in a robotic FME implantation system to monitor the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point. By extracting regions of interest (ROIs) from raw images and inputting them into a pretrained vision transformer (ViT), anomalies can be detected at different checkpoints. A progressive granularity patch feature sampling method is employed to address sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issues, optimizing performance at various locations. Additionally, a selection of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios enhances descriptors for each specific scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is confirmed through validation with image datasets from the implantation system. <div>

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point, respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image datasets collected from our implantation system.

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently, state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However, existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

Summary: 
In this study, the authors introduce a method called Dense2MoE to address the issue of large parameter size and inference overhead in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for text-to-image generation. By transforming a dense DiT into a Mixture of Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, the number of activated parameters is reduced while maintaining model capacity. The Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks are replaced with MoE layers, resulting in a 62.5% reduction in activated parameters. Additionally, the Mixture of Blocks (MoB) approach is proposed to selectively activate DiT blocks for further sparsity enhancement. A multi-step distillation pipeline is designed for effective conversion, incorporating expert initialization, knowledge distillation, and group feature loss for MoB optimization. The Dense2MoE transformation of large diffusion transformers achieves a 60% reduction in activated parameters without sacrificing performance, surpassing pruning-based methods in experiments. This advancement establishes a more efficient paradigm for text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g., FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\% while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for efficient text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features. This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline, from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively.

The model was trained and validated on a combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets. Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set, achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K) on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4 $N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in visual grounding.

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies, present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention, enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples, exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets, directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

Summary: 
PSepT (Polar Separable Transform) is introduced as a separable orthogonal transform that addresses the limitations of traditional methods in computer vision. By utilizing a tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, PSepT achieves complete kernel factorization and enables independent radial and angular processing. This design significantly reduces computational complexity to O(N^2 log N), memory requirements to O(N^2), and condition number scaling to O(√N). PSepT demonstrates orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and rotation-covariance properties, along with improved numerical stability and computational efficiency. Experimental results show competitive classification performance on structured datasets while maintaining exact reconstruction. The separable framework of PSepT opens up new possibilities for high-order moment analysis in image analysis applications. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$ complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$, representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis applications.

<div> training feature attribution, deep neural networks, explainability methods, trust, accountability

Summary:
training feature attribution is explored in this work for deep neural networks to provide insights into model workings. This approach links test predictions to specific regions of training images, offering fine-grained, test-specific explanations. It identifies harmful examples driving misclassifications and exposes spurious correlations like patch-based shortcuts that other attribution methods may miss. By studying both input features and influential training examples together, a better understanding of model behavior is achieved. This method enhances the trust and accountability of deep learning models by shedding light on their inner workings. <div>

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features (e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution methods fail to expose.

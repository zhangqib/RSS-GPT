<div> Hierarchical attention structure, Vision-Language Models, Token pruning, Computational efficiency, Model-agnostic.

Summary: 
The paper introduces HiPrune, a novel token pruning framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that leverages the hierarchical attention structure within vision encoders. It categorizes tokens into Anchor tokens, Buffer tokens, and Register tokens based on their attention patterns in different layers. HiPrune does not require retraining and can be integrated seamlessly with any ViT-based VLM. Experimental results on various datasets show that HiPrune achieves state-of-the-art pruning performance, preserving high task accuracy with significantly fewer tokens. It also reduces inference FLOPs and latency by up to 9 times, demonstrating strong generalization across different models and tasks. The code for HiPrune is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Danielement321/HiPrune.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode images into lengthy sequences of visual tokens, leading to excessive computational overhead and limited inference efficiency. While prior efforts prune or merge tokens to address this issue, they often rely on special tokens (e.g., CLS) or require task-specific training, hindering scalability across architectures. In this paper, we propose HiPrune, a training-free and model-agnostic token Pruning framework that exploits the Hierarchical attention structure within vision encoders. We identify that middle layers attend to object-centric regions, while deep layers capture global contextual features. Based on this observation, HiPrune selects three types of informative tokens: (1) Anchor tokens with high attention in object-centric layers, (2) Buffer tokens adjacent to anchors for spatial continuity, and (3) Register tokens with strong attention in deep layers for global summarization. Our method requires no retraining and integrates seamlessly with any ViT-based VLM. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that HiPrune achieves state-of-the-art pruning performance, preserving up to 99.3% task accuracy with only 33.3% tokens, and maintaining 99.5% accuracy with just 11.1% tokens. Meanwhile, it reduces inference FLOPs and latency by up to 9$\times$, showcasing strong generalization across models and tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Danielement321/HiPrune.

Summary:
Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into a novel, training-free framework to improve sign spotting in sign language videos. Global spatio-temporal and hand shape features are extracted and matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping and cosine similarity. This approach offers vocabulary flexibility without needing model retraining. An LLM performs gloss disambiguation through beam search to reduce noise and ambiguity without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show higher accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional methods, demonstrating the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Sign spotting, the task of identifying and localizing individual signs within continuous sign language video, plays a pivotal role in scaling dataset annotations and addressing the severe data scarcity issue in sign language translation. While automatic sign spotting holds great promise for enabling frame-level supervision at scale, it grapples with challenges such as vocabulary inflexibility and ambiguity inherent in continuous sign streams. Hence, we introduce a novel, training-free framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to significantly enhance sign spotting quality. Our approach extracts global spatio-temporal and hand shape features, which are then matched against a large-scale sign dictionary using dynamic time warping and cosine similarity. This dictionary-based matching inherently offers superior vocabulary flexibility without requiring model retraining. To mitigate noise and ambiguity from the matching process, an LLM performs context-aware gloss disambiguation via beam search, notably without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world sign language datasets demonstrate our method's superior accuracy and sentence fluency compared to traditional approaches, highlighting the potential of LLMs in advancing sign spotting.

<div> Keywords: Text-Video Retrieval, multi-modal large language models, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation, Candidate Prior Normalization, relevance.

Summary: 
The study focuses on improving Text-Video Retrieval by addressing candidate prior bias when using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). The proposed framework, BLiM, integrates query and candidate likelihoods to generate text from videos and video features from text. Additionally, Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN) is introduced to counter candidate prior bias in candidate likelihood without requiring training data. Through experiments on four benchmarks, BLiM with CPN achieves a 6.4 R@1 improvement over existing models, emphasizing the relevance between queries and candidates. The study also demonstrates CPN's effectiveness in enhancing visual understanding across various multi-modal tasks, reducing dependence on textual priors. The code for BLiM is available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Text-Video Retrieval aims to find the most relevant text (or video) candidate given a video (or text) query from large-scale online databases. Recent work leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval, especially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that the naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood, introduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher priors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel retrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM), which leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to generate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text. Furthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet effective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate prior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks, our BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4 R@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing query-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal tasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances visual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors.

<div> acceleration, auto-regressive models, mesh generation, speculative decoding, distillation

Summary:
XSpecMesh is a novel acceleration technique for auto-regressive mesh generation models that allows for predicting multiple tokens in parallel within a single forward pass, resulting in a 1.7x speedup during inference without compromising quality. The method utilizes a lightweight, multi-head speculative decoding scheme to expedite the generation process. A verification and resampling strategy is implemented to ensure the predicted tokens meet quality standards, with any outliers being resampled by the backbone model. Furthermore, a distillation strategy is employed to train the lightweight decoding heads by distilling knowledge from the backbone model, enhancing the alignment of prediction distributions and improving the success rate of speculative predictions. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of XSpecMesh in accelerating mesh generation while maintaining top-notch quality standards. The code for XSpecMesh will be made available for public use. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Current auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, topologically precise meshes; however, they necessitate thousands-or even tens of thousands-of next-token predictions during inference, resulting in substantial latency. We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for auto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight, multi-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel within a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further propose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies each predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality criteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the lightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging their prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of speculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will be released.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for workforce training, offering immersive, interactive, and risk-free environments that enhance skill acquisition, decision-making, and confidence. Despite its advantages, developing VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to the time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging instructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the generation of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two core components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the text, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated demonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module receives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information. Based on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant data from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by changing the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate tasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development overhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving industrial needs.

Abstract: Circle fitting methods are extensively utilized in various industries, particularly in quality control processes and design applications. The effectiveness of these algorithms can be significantly compromised when the point sets to be predicted are noisy. To mitigate this issue, outlier detection and removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure. This study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD) algorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In the proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar coordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard deviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with the global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed method are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement of industrial washer parts. Images from a machine vision system are processed through preprocessing steps, including sub-pixel edge detection. The resulting sub-pixel edge points are then cleaned using the proposed outlier detection and removal algorithm, after which circle fitting is performed. A comparison is made using ten different circle fitting algorithms and five distinct outlier detection methods. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the other approaches, delivering the best performance in terms of accuracy within the dataset, thereby demonstrating its potential for enhancing circle fitting applications in industrial environments.

<div> camera measurement systems, telecentric lenses, measurement errors, conversion factor-based method, pixel-based method 
Summary:
The study proposes two new approaches to improve measurement accuracy in camera measurement systems using telecentric lenses. The first approach utilizes a conversion factor from known reference parts to calculate the diameter of unknown parts, while the second approach directly estimates diameter using pixel-based information. Experimental tests on glass and metal samples show a significant reduction in measurement errors, from 13-114 micrometers to 1-2 micrometers, by employing these methods. The proposed approaches enable high-accuracy measurements of parts within the camera's field of view with only a few known reference parts. This innovative method contributes to the existing diameter measurement literature by enhancing measurement reliability and reducing error rates.

Abstract: In camera measurement systems, specialized equipment such as telecentric lenses is often employed to measure parts with narrow tolerances. However, despite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to mechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are particularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are measured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to enhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion factor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the conversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter (mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly estimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The experimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses. Tests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show that measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were reduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few known reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement of all parts within the camera's field of view. Additionally, this method enhances the existing diameter measurement literature by significantly reducing error rates and improving measurement reliability.

Summary:
The article discusses the challenges in automated PCB footprint geometry labeling for integrated circuits (IC) due to unstructured drawings and abstract annotations. Current Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) struggle with accurate geometric perception in solving this problem. To address this, a novel framework called LLM4-IC8K is proposed, which treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LMMs for structured geometric interpretation. The framework involves three sub-tasks: perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin, and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. A two-stage training approach on a multi-modal dataset called ICGeo8K, with both hand-crafted and synthetically generated samples, is utilized to enhance model performance. The experiments show that LLM4-IC8K outperforms existing LMMs on the proposed benchmark. <div>

Abstract: Printed-Circuit-board (PCB) footprint geometry labeling of integrated circuits (IC) is essential in defining the physical interface between components and the PCB layout, requiring exceptional visual perception proficiency. However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings. In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks: perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin, and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with 8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and 4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.

Abstract: Thermal infrared imaging exhibits considerable potentials for robotic perception tasks, especially in environments with poor visibility or challenging lighting conditions. However, TIR images typically suffer from heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic deployment.

Summary: 
The study introduces a novel multimodal approach, MM-Misogyny, designed to detect, categorize, and explain misogynistic content in memes which are popular in entertainment but can also spread harmful ideologies like misogyny. MM-Misogyny processes text and image modalities separately and unifies them using a cross-attention mechanism to detect and classify misogyny in memes.

Abstract: Memes are popular in the modern world and are distributed primarily for entertainment. However, harmful ideologies such as misogyny can be propagated through innocent-looking memes. The detection and understanding of why a meme is misogynous is a research challenge due to its multimodal nature (image and text) and its nuanced manifestations across different societal contexts. We introduce a novel multimodal approach, \textit{namely}, \textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} to detect, categorize, and explain misogynistic content in memes. \textit{\textbf{MM-Misogyny}} processes text and image modalities separately and unifies them into a multimodal context through a cross-attention mechanism. The resulting multimodal context is then easily processed for labeling, categorization, and explanation via a classifier and Large Language Model (LLM). The evaluation of the proposed model is performed on a newly curated dataset (\textit{\textbf{W}hat's \textbf{B}eneath \textbf{M}isogynous \textbf{S}tereotyping (WBMS)}) created by collecting misogynous memes from cyberspace and categorizing them into four categories, \textit{namely}, Kitchen, Leadership, Working, and Shopping. The model not only detects and classifies misogyny, but also provides a granular understanding of how misogyny operates in domains of life. The results demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to existing methods.

Summary:<br /><br />
The paper introduces a novel approach for generating a coherent sequence of images that tell a visual story using text-to-image diffusion models. The key challenge addressed is maintaining subject consistency across all story scenes without the need for fine-tuning or retraining models. The proposed method is training-free and seamlessly integrates with pre-trained diffusion models. It achieves subject consistency by introducing masked cross-image attention sharing to dynamically align subject features across images in a batch. Additionally, Regional Feature Harmonization refines visually similar details to enhance subject consistency. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in generating visually consistent subjects across various scenarios while preserving the creative abilities of the diffusion model. This efficient method offers a practical solution to the computational and time-consuming challenges associated with ensuring subject consistency in image generation tasks. <div>

Abstract: Generating a coherent sequence of images that tells a visual story, using text-to-image diffusion models, often faces the critical challenge of maintaining subject consistency across all story scenes. Existing approaches, which typically rely on fine-tuning or retraining models, are computationally expensive, time-consuming, and often interfere with the model's pre-existing capabilities. In this paper, we follow a training-free approach and propose an efficient consistent-subject-generation method. This approach works seamlessly with pre-trained diffusion models by introducing masked cross-image attention sharing to dynamically align subject features across a batch of images, and Regional Feature Harmonization to refine visually similar details for improved subject consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully generates visually consistent subjects across a variety of scenarios while maintaining the creative abilities of the diffusion model.

Abstract: Environment mapping is an important computing task for a wide range of smart city applications, including autonomous navigation, wireless network operations and extended reality environments. Conventional smart city mapping techniques, such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth. However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei. We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of 65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields 40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and (iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.

Abstract: Discretization of semantic features enables interoperability between semantic and digital communication systems, showing significant potential for practical applications. The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized (VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook updates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard. Experimental results demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system over benchmark methods.

Summary: <br />
This paper addresses the challenges in integrating artificial intelligence (AI) with geospatial research. The research focuses on developing a deep learning model for object detection, specifically of natural features, in a weakly supervised manner. The model utilizes weak labels and incorporates Tobler's first law of geography to create a spatially explicit model. Attention maps are integrated into the object detection pipeline, and a multistage training strategy is implemented to enhance performance. The developed model is applied to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that previously required manual effort.

Abstract: Recent interest in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has fostered a wide range of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep learning, for geospatial problem solving. However, major challenges such as a lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features, in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance. Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets. This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.

<div> Computer vision, urban rail, platform occupancy, real-time estimation, CCTV<br />
Summary:<br />
- The study explores the use of computer vision techniques for estimating urban rail platform occupancy in real-time, using CCTV footage as the primary data source.
- Three state-of-the-art approaches are compared: object detection and counting, crowd-level classification, and semantic segmentation.
- A novel linear optimization-based approach is introduced to extract counts while considering passenger dispersion along the platform.
- Tested on a privacy-preserving dataset from WMATA, the results show the potential of computer vision for accurate crowd estimation.
- The findings suggest that CCTV image data alone can enable precise real-time crowding estimates and aid transit agencies in making timely operational decisions for crowd mitigation.<br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately estimating urban rail platform occupancy can enhance transit agencies' ability to make informed operational decisions, thereby improving safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience, particularly in the context of crowding. However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate, real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus, for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data, independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational responses for platform crowding mitigation.

Summary: 
A novel deep-learning framework is proposed to address the challenge of efficient and accurate weed segmentation from drone video in precision agriculture. The framework includes specialized pre-processing and transformer models optimized for common image degradations like noise and blur. By analyzing quality conditions such as blur and noise, the system dynamically routes inputs to different vision transformer models based on the type of degradation detected. The proposed routing strategy allows the system to outperform existing CNN-based methods in both segmentation quality and computational efficiency. This advancement in deep-learning applications for agriculture shows promise for improving weed management practices in precision agriculture. <div>

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for efficient and accurate weed segmentation from drone video in precision agriculture. A quality-aware modular deep-learning framework is proposed that addresses common image degradation by analyzing quality conditions-such as blur and noise-and routing inputs through specialized pre-processing and transformer models optimized for each degradation type. The system first analyzes drone images for noise and blur using Mean Absolute Deviation and the Laplacian. Data is then dynamically routed to one of three vision transformer models: a baseline for clean images, a modified transformer with Fisher Vector encoding for noise reduction, or another with an unrolled Lucy-Robinson decoder to correct blur. This novel routing strategy allows the system to outperform existing CNN-based methods in both segmentation quality and computational efficiency, demonstrating a significant advancement in deep-learning applications for agriculture.

Summary: 
Machine learning models for automated invoice processing require large and diverse datasets, which can be challenging to acquire due to privacy regulations and manual annotation costs. This study introduces a pipeline for generating synthetic invoice documents and structured data to address this issue. The method involves using OCR to extract text and layout from a source invoice, replacing select data fields with synthetic content from a language model, and inpainting to render the new text while preserving the original layout. This process results in a visually realistic invoice image and corresponding structured data file. By automating the creation of synthetic invoices, this approach offers a scalable solution to enhance small datasets, facilitating the training of more accurate document intelligence models. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models for automated invoice processing is critically dependent on large-scale, diverse datasets. However, the acquisition of such datasets is often constrained by privacy regulations and the high cost of manual annotation. To address this, we present a novel pipeline for generating high-fidelity, synthetic invoice documents and their corresponding structured data. Our method first utilizes Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract the text content and precise spatial layout from a source invoice. Select data fields are then replaced with contextually realistic, synthetic content generated by a large language model (LLM). Finally, we employ an inpainting technique to erase the original text from the image and render the new, synthetic text in its place, preserving the exact layout and font characteristics. This process yields a pair of outputs: a visually realistic new invoice image and a perfectly aligned structured data file (JSON) reflecting the synthetic content. Our approach provides a scalable and automated solution to amplify small, private datasets, enabling the creation of large, varied corpora for training more robust and accurate document intelligence models.

<br />
Summary: 
Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a popular approach for training LMM models, also applicable to low-level vision tasks like image quality assessment (IQA). Existing RFT-based IQA methods lack supervision for the reasoning process, potentially limiting performance. To address this, a multi-stage RFT IQA framework called Refine-IQA is proposed. Stage-1 involves creating a dataset and designing multi-task reward functions to enhance the model's visual quality perception. In Stage-2, a strategy involving probability difference reward is introduced for "think" process supervision in the quality scoring task. The Refine-IQA models demonstrate exceptional performance in perception and scoring tasks, activating a robust quality interpreting capability that excels in quality interpreting benchmark as well. <div>

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training. Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process, leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907 locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust "think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift, and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements. Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet, an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated characterization.

Abstract: Evaluating text-to-image generation models requires alignment with human perception, yet existing human-centric metrics are constrained by limited data coverage, suboptimal feature extraction, and inefficient loss functions. To address these challenges, we introduce Human Preference Score v3 (HPSv3). (1) We release HPDv3, the first wide-spectrum human preference dataset integrating 1.08M text-image pairs and 1.17M annotated pairwise comparisons from state-of-the-art generative models and low to high-quality real-world images. (2) We introduce a VLM-based preference model trained using an uncertainty-aware ranking loss for fine-grained ranking. Besides, we propose Chain-of-Human-Preference (CoHP), an iterative image refinement method that enhances quality without extra data, using HPSv3 to select the best image at each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPSv3 serves as a robust metric for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP offers an efficient and human-aligned approach to improve image generation quality.

Abstract: Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning models has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a framework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the second stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in identifying large craters with high precision.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a diffusion model for generating point-based shape representations with point correspondences. While deep learning methods usually focus on unordered point clouds without considering correspondences, this proposed model aims to preserve point correspondences in generated shapes. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the model is applied to generate realistic hippocampal shape representations using data from OASIS-3. The generated shapes are compared favorably to existing methods. Furthermore, the model's utility is showcased through tasks such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects, and predicting morphological changes in disease progression through counterfactual generation. The diffusion model presents a novel approach for generating shape representations with preserved point correspondences and shows promise in various applications related to shape analysis. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.03925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a diffusion model designed to generate point-based shape representations with correspondences. Traditional statistical shape models have considered point correspondences extensively, but current deep learning methods do not take them into account, focusing on unordered point clouds instead. Current deep generative models for point clouds do not address generating shapes with point correspondences between generated shapes. This work aims to formulate a diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic point-based shape representations, which preserve point correspondences that are present in the training data. Using shape representation data with correspondences derived from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), we demonstrate that our correspondence-preserving model effectively generates point-based hippocampal shape representations that are highly realistic compared to existing methods. We further demonstrate the applications of our generative model by downstream tasks, such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects and predicting morphological changes of disease progression by counterfactual generation.

Summary:<br />
This paper introduces a recommend system to assist machine learning-based segmentation models in optimizing prostate cancer segmentation performance. The system utilizes a policy network to suggest the best imaging modality and sections of interest for review, improving annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy. By training the network on a dataset of multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, the system outperforms standard segmentation networks. The dynamic decision-making process, guided by the policy network, allows for improved tumor localization even in the presence of challenging pathology. Importantly, the trained agent develops its own optimal strategy, potentially diverging from current radiologist guidelines like PI-RADS. This suggests a promising interactive application where the policy networks can assist human radiologists in enhancing their reading strategies. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at different locations from different images independently as well as concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy, especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human radiologists.

Summary: 
The article presents a two-stage training paradigm for scaling up audio-synchronized visual animation using noisy but abundant videos. In the first stage, large-scale videos are automatically curated for pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse audio-video alignments. The second stage involves finetuning the model on manually curated high-quality examples but at a smaller scale, reducing human effort significantly. The synchronization is enhanced by leveraging multi-feature conditioning and window attention for rich audio context per frame. By utilizing pretrained text-to-video generators and audio encoders, the model can learn audio-conditioning capability with minimal additional trainable parameters. The proposed method is evaluated on the AVSync48 benchmark, which includes videos from 48 diverse classes, showcasing over a 10 times reduction in manual curation reliance while generalizing well to open classes.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of video content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods rely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific training videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes in the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training paradigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but noisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video alignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated high-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the required human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each frame to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window attention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video generator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\% additional trainable parameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the generator's prior knowledge. For evaluation, we introduce AVSync48, a benchmark with videos from 48 classes, which is 3$\times$ more diverse than previous benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces reliance on manual curation by over 10$\times$, while generalizing to many open classes.

<div> Keywords: RAVID, image detection, visual retrieval-augmented generation, CLIP, vision-language model

Summary:
RAVID is introduced as the first framework for AI-generated image detection using visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). By leveraging a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder called RAVID CLIP and a vision-language model (VLM), RAVID dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection accuracy. Experiments on the UniversalFakeDetect benchmark demonstrate that RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%. Furthermore, RAVID shows improved robustness by maintaining high accuracy even under image degradations like Gaussian blur and JPEG compression, outperforming traditional methods. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under degradation conditions compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model C2P-CLIP. Overall, RAVID's innovative approach of combining visual retrieval with a VLM results in improved detection accuracy and robustness for AI-generated images.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RAVID, the first framework for AI-generated image detection that leverages visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While RAG methods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation models, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge underexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with generalization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and model-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with category-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further integrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the query, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID generates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images from a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched input for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%. RAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining high accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG compression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under degradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model C2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG compression scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

<div> pre-training, deep learning, nutritional estimation, Vision Transformer, transfer learning
<br />
Summary: 
This paper explores the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance of deep learning models for estimating nutritional content from 2D food images. The study compares models pre-trained on public datasets like ImageNet and COYO with those pre-trained on a proprietary JFT-300M dataset. Results show that models pre-trained on JFT-300M outperform those pre-trained on public datasets. Surprisingly, the model pre-trained on COYO performs worse than the one pre-trained on ImageNet for this specific task. The research emphasizes the importance of pre-training dataset characteristics, such as scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, in effective transfer learning for nutritional estimation in 2D images. <div>

Abstract: Estimating the nutritional content of food from images is a critical task with significant implications for health and dietary monitoring. This is challenging, especially when relying solely on 2D images, due to the variability in food presentation, lighting, and the inherent difficulty in inferring volume and mass without depth information. Furthermore, reproducibility in this domain is hampered by the reliance of state-of-the-art methods on proprietary datasets for large-scale pre-training. In this paper, we investigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance of deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images. We fine-tune and evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on two large public datasets, ImageNet and COYO, comparing their performance against baseline CNN models (InceptionV2 and ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method pre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset. We conduct extensive experiments on the Nutrition5k dataset, a large-scale collection of real-world food plates with high-precision nutritional annotations. Our evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAE%) reveals that models pre-trained on JFT-300M significantly outperform those pre-trained on public datasets. Unexpectedly, the model pre-trained on the massive COYO dataset performs worse than the model pre-trained on ImageNet for this specific regression task, refuting our initial hypothesis. Our analysis provides quantitative evidence highlighting the critical role of pre-training dataset characteristics, including scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, for effective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.

Summary:<br />
- Limited data and annotations are challenges in weakly supervised medical image segmentation.
- Random mixing of volumetric blocks for data augmentation can disrupt anatomical continuity in 3D medical images.
- JanusNet, a new data augmentation framework, globally models anatomical continuity and addresses hard-to-segment regions locally.
- JanusNet includes Slice-Block Shuffle and Confidence-Guided Displacement steps.
- JanusNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20% labeled data.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited by the scarcity of training samples and annotations, weakly supervised medical image segmentation often employs data augmentation to increase data diversity, while randomly mixing volumetric blocks has demonstrated strong performance. However, this approach disrupts the inherent anatomical continuity of 3D medical images along orthogonal axes, leading to severe structural inconsistencies and insufficient training in challenging regions, such as small-sized organs, etc. To better comply with and utilize human anatomical information, we propose JanusNet}, a data augmentation framework for 3D medical data that globally models anatomical continuity while locally focusing on hard-to-segment regions. Specifically, our Slice-Block Shuffle step performs aligned shuffling of same-index slice blocks across volumes along a random axis, while preserving the anatomical context on planes perpendicular to the perturbation axis. Concurrently, the Confidence-Guided Displacement step uses prediction reliability to replace blocks within each slice, amplifying signals from difficult areas. This dual-stage, axis-aligned framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal code changes for most teacher-student schemes. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and AMOS datasets demonstrate that JanusNet significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving, for instance, a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20% labeled data.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are widely used across industrial design, simulation, and manufacturing processes. Text-to-CAD systems aim to generate editable, general-purpose CAD models from textual descriptions, significantly reducing the complexity and entry barrier associated with traditional CAD workflows. However, rendering CAD models can be slow, and deploying VLMs to review CAD models can be expensive and may introduce reward hacking that degrades the systems. To address these challenges, we propose CAD-Judge, a novel, verifiable reward system for efficient and effective CAD preference grading and grammatical validation. We adopt the Compiler-as-a-Judge Module (CJM) as a fast, direct reward signal, optimizing model alignment by maximizing generative utility through prospect theory. To further improve the robustness of Text-to-CAD in the testing phase, we introduce a simple yet effective agentic CAD generation approach and adopt the Compiler-as-a-Review Module (CRM), which efficiently verifies the generated CAD models, enabling the system to refine them accordingly. Extensive experiments on challenging CAD datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency.

Summary:
The paper introduces $\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT, a post-training quantization framework for video diffusion models (V-DMs) that leverages salient data and sparse token distillation. It addresses the challenges posed by the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in V-DMs, including high calibration variance and learning difficulties. By utilizing Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection during calibration, the framework constructs high-quality calibration datasets tailored to V-DMs. Additionally, Attention-guided Sparse Token Distillation emphasizes influential tokens based on sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs. Under W4A6 quantization, $\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance, 3.9 times model compression, and 1.3 times inference acceleration. The proposed framework provides a promising solution for reducing computational costs in video generation models without sacrificing performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{$\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT}, a post-training quantization framework for V-DMs that leverages \textbf{S}alient data and \textbf{S}parse token distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs. Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6 quantization, $\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering $3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration.

Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in handling complex multimodal tasks. However, they have been observed to passively accept flawed inputs, raising concerns about their ability to actively detect errors. To address this, the Input Scrutiny Ability Evaluation Framework (ISEval) was introduced, assessing seven categories of flawed premises and three evaluation metrics. Results from evaluating ten advanced LMMs reveal a strong reliance on explicit prompts for error identification, with models excelling at detecting logical fallacies but struggling with linguistic errors and conditional flaws. Modality trust varies among models, highlighting the need to enhance proactive verification of input validity in LMMs. This research provides insights for improving error detection in large multimodal models.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have witnessed remarkable growth, showcasing formidable capabilities in handling intricate multimodal tasks with exceptional performance. Recent research has underscored the inclination of large language models to passively accept defective inputs, often resulting in futile reasoning on invalid prompts. However, the same critical question of whether LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs still remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Input Scrutiny Ability Evaluation Framework (ISEval), which encompasses seven categories of flawed premises and three evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation of ten advanced LMMs has identified key findings. Most models struggle to actively detect flawed textual premises without guidance, which reflects a strong reliance on explicit prompts for premise error identification. Error type affects performance: models excel at identifying logical fallacies but struggle with surface-level linguistic errors and certain conditional flaws. Modality trust varies-Gemini 2.5 pro and Claude Sonnet 4 balance visual and textual info, while aya-vision-8b over-rely on text in conflicts. These insights underscore the urgent need to enhance LMMs' proactive verification of input validity and shed novel insights into mitigating the problem.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network (PDSSNet) for semantic segmentation of remote sensing images. It addresses challenges of high intra-class variance and inter-class similarity by incorporating class semantics and spatial structure. The network includes three key modules: Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) for unbiased class prototypes, Semantic-Structure Coordination Module (SSCM) for hierarchical semantics-first approach, and Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) for discriminative feature focus. PDSSNet outperforms existing methods in segmentation accuracy. The proposed network enhances semantic representation by integrating class semantics and structural information, leading to more complete ground object segmentation. The source code for PDSSNet is available on GitHub for further research and development.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, acquiring complete ground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task is severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and high inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete segmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class representations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations and a neglect of target structural information.
  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network (PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first, structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information. Finally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic step-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between classes.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/wangjunyi-1/PDSSNet.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Dual prompt Learning with Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR) for precise image-text matching in Image-Text Retrieval (ITR) tasks. The framework dynamically adjusts prompt vectors from semantic and visual dimensions to enhance the performance of CLIP on ITR. DCAR optimizes attribute and class features concurrently to improve fine-grained representation learning. At the attribute level, it updates attribute description weights based on text-image mutual information correlation. At the category level, it introduces negative samples with category-matching weighting to distinguish subcategories. The Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD) constructed for validation covers over 1,500 fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with attribute annotations. Extensive experiments on FDRD show that DCAR outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Recently, prompt learning has demonstrated remarkable success in adapting pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks such as image classification. However, its application to the downstream Image-Text Retrieval (ITR) task is more challenging. We find that the challenge lies in discriminating both fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories of the downstream data. To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning with Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning framework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically adjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the performance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm, DCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained representation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it dynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image mutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces negative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to learn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging benchmark for ITR in downstream data domains. It covers over 1,500 downstream fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with detailed attribute annotations. Extensive experiments on FDRD demonstrate that DCAR achieves state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines.

Summary:<br />
This article addresses the challenge of Non-Line-of-Sight blind spots in urban environments caused by parked vehicles. It presents a novel approach that combines monocular camera images with 2D radar point cloud data to detect pedestrians in these obscured areas. The method first identifies parked vehicles through image segmentation and estimates depth to understand the spatial layout. It then refines this information using radar PCD for more accurate spatial inference. By integrating these technologies, the framework improves early pedestrian detection and enhances road safety in real-world urban road environments. This approach is crucial for scenarios where pedestrians suddenly emerge from between parked vehicles, which can act as temporary spatial obstructions. The method overcomes the limitations of relying on predefined spatial information and adapts to dynamic road conditions where parked vehicles may relocate over time. <div>
arXiv:2508.04033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety, particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent studies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations. To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise spatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road environments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian detection and contributes to improved road safety.

Summary:
The article presents a novel approach, the Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet), to address efficiency bottlenecks in dark image restoration methods. The proposed network incorporates a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) to generate endogenous guidance, eliminating the need for external priors and reducing computational overhead. By analyzing frequency domain characteristics, the network reconstructs and compresses operations, leading to significant parameter reduction. Additionally, a Dual-Frequency Guidance Framework (DFGF) is introduced to strategically process high and low frequencies separately, decreasing computational complexity. Evaluation on various benchmarks demonstrates that SPJFNet outperforms existing methods in performance while achieving substantial efficiency improvements. The proposed model is not only superior in terms of quality but also reduces model complexity and computational demands. The code for SPJFNet is available on GitHub for further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current dark image restoration methods suffer from severe efficiency bottlenecks, primarily stemming from: (1) computational burden and error correction costs associated with reliance on external priors (manual or cross-modal); (2) redundant operations in complex multi-stage enhancement pipelines; and (3) indiscriminate processing across frequency components in frequency-domain methods, leading to excessive global computational demands. To address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model complexity and computational overhead.

Summary:<br />
Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is crucial for intelligent agents to understand scenes, model causal relationships, and predict future states. Existing benchmarks for VTR have limitations in task complexity and coverage. To address this, VisualTrans is introduced, a benchmark designed for real-world human-object interaction scenarios. It includes 12 manipulation tasks and evaluates spatial, procedural, and quantitative reasoning dimensions. The benchmark features high-quality question-answer pairs in various formats. Data construction involves first-person manipulation videos and human verification ensures quality. State-of-the-art models perform well in static tasks but struggle with dynamic reasoning scenarios, revealing weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning. This highlights the need for future research in developing more capable VTR systems. <div>

Abstract: Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is a vital cognitive capability that empowers intelligent agents to understand dynamic scenes, model causal relationships, and predict future states, and thereby guiding actions and laying the foundation for advanced intelligent systems. However, existing benchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and incomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world human-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically diverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential reasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6 well-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality question-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended counting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction pipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large multimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification ensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations of various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in static spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic, multi-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state recognition and transformation sequence planning. These findings highlight fundamental weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, providing clear directions for future research aimed at developing more capable and generalizable VTR systems.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted considerable attention in medical image processing. The latest SSL methods use a combination of consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to achieve remarkable success. However, most existing SSL studies focus on segmenting large organs, neglecting the challenging scenarios where there are numerous tumors or tumors of small volume. Furthermore, the extensive capabilities of data augmentation strategies, particularly in the context of both labeled and unlabeled data, have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a straightforward yet effective approach, termed iterative pseudo-labeling based adaptive copy-paste supervision (IPA-CP), for tumor segmentation in CT scans. IPA-CP incorporates a two-way uncertainty based adaptive augmentation mechanism, aiming to inject tumor uncertainties present in the mean teacher architecture into adaptive augmentation. Additionally, IPA-CP employs an iterative pseudo-label transition strategy to generate more robust and informative pseudo labels for the unlabeled samples. Extensive experiments on both in-house and public datasets show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation. Ablation study results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technical contributions.

<div> lexicon, motion semantics, signer identity, motion synthesis, neural rendering
Summary:
This article introduces a new approach to sign language video generation that addresses key challenges of signer-specific data requirements and poor generalization. The proposed framework decouples motion semantics from signer identity through a two-phase synthesis process. First, a signer-independent multimodal motion lexicon is constructed, storing gloss sequences as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D mesh sequences. This representation allows for a discrete-to-continuous motion synthesis stage and identity-aware neural rendering, resulting in photorealistic videos of any signer. By treating motion as a primary factor, the method enables high-quality synthesis and enhanced flexibility in signer personalization. Extensive experiments show that disentangling motion from identity not only works effectively but also offers advantages in producing realistic sign language videos. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Sign language video generation requires producing natural signing motions with realistic appearances under precise semantic control, yet faces two critical challenges: excessive signer-specific data requirements and poor generalization. We propose a new paradigm for sign language video generation that decouples motion semantics from signer identity through a two-phase synthesis framework. First, we construct a signer-independent multimodal motion lexicon, where each gloss is stored as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D mesh sequences, requiring only one recording per sign. This compact representation enables our second key innovation: a discrete-to-continuous motion synthesis stage that transforms retrieved gloss sequences into temporally coherent motion trajectories, followed by identity-aware neural rendering to produce photorealistic videos of arbitrary signers. Unlike prior work constrained by signer-specific datasets, our method treats motion as a first-class citizen: the learned latent pose dynamics serve as a portable "choreography layer" that can be visually realized through different human appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that disentangling motion from identity is not just viable but advantageous - enabling both high-quality synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

<div> Keywords: cross-view object correspondence, Dense Object Matching and Refinement framework, ego-centric views, exo-centric views, dense object matching

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel Dense Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework for establishing dense object correspondences between egocentric and exocentric views. The framework consists of the Dense Object Matcher (DOM) module, which incorporates visual, spatial, and semantic cues to find correspondences among objects. Unlike traditional methods, DOM considers both positional and semantic relationships among objects. Additionally, a mask refinement head is integrated into DOM to enhance the completeness and accuracy of predicted masks. Evaluation on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark shows that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods, achieving a mean intersection over union (IoU) of 49.7% on Ego-to-Exo matching and 55.2% on Exo-to-Ego matching. These results validate the effectiveness of the integrated approach for cross-view object understanding.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence involves matching objects between egocentric (first-person) and exocentric (third-person) views. It is a critical yet challenging task for visual understanding. In this work, we propose the Dense Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework to establish dense object correspondences across views. The framework centers around the Dense Object Matcher (DOM) module, which jointly models multiple objects. Unlike methods that directly match individual object masks to image features, DOM leverages both positional and semantic relationships among objects to find correspondences. DOM integrates a proposal generation module with a dense matching module that jointly encodes visual, spatial, and semantic cues, explicitly constructing inter-object relationships to achieve dense matching among objects. Furthermore, we combine DOM with a mask refinement head designed to improve the completeness and accuracy of the predicted masks, forming the complete DOMR framework. Extensive evaluations on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean IoU of 49.7% on Ego$\to$Exo and 55.2% on Exo$\to$Ego. These results outperform those of previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively, validating the effectiveness of our integrated approach for cross-view understanding.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new method, GPI-WT, which uses a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable Interpolation for k-space interpolation in accelerated MRI. By formulating GPI as a structured low-rank model, the method leverages global annihilation filters as learnable parameters and introduces a learnable attention mechanism. The proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods in k-space interpolation accuracy while also providing superior interpretability. By unfolding the optimization algorithm of the structured low-rank model into a cascaded network, the white-box Transformer framework demonstrates better exploitation of global dependencies in k-space, enhancing the reliability of interpolated data. <div>
arXiv:2508.04051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpolating missing data in k-space is essential for accelerating imaging. However, existing methods, including convolutional neural network-based deep learning, primarily exploit local predictability while overlooking the inherent global dependencies in k-space. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in natural language processing and image analysis due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies. This inspires the use of Transformers for k-space interpolation to better exploit its global structure. However, their lack of interpretability raises concerns regarding the reliability of interpolated data. To address this limitation, we propose GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable Interpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the perspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model. The global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable parameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable attention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm of SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer specifically designed for accelerated MRI. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in k-space interpolation accuracy while providing superior interpretability.

<div> Keywords: document restoration, diffusion, multi-task learning, scalability, prior fusion module <br />
Summary: <br />
The paper introduces Uni-DocDiff, a unified document restoration model based on diffusion. It addresses the challenge of handling multiple restoration tasks through a learnable task prompt design, enabling scalability across diverse tasks. The model incorporates a Prior Pool mechanism that combines local and global features to enhance multi-task capabilities and mitigate task interference. The Prior Fusion Module selectively integrates relevant prior information for each task. Experimental results demonstrate Uni-DocDiff's versatility and performance on par with task-specific models, with the added advantage of scalability for new tasks. <div>
arXiv:2508.04055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Removing various degradations from damaged documents greatly benefits digitization, downstream document analysis, and readability. Previous methods often treat each restoration task independently with dedicated models, leading to a cumbersome and highly complex document processing system. Although recent studies attempt to unify multiple tasks, they often suffer from limited scalability due to handcrafted prompts and heavy preprocessing, and fail to fully exploit inter-task synergy within a shared architecture. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Uni-DocDiff, a Unified and highly scalable Document restoration model based on Diffusion. Uni-DocDiff develops a learnable task prompt design, ensuring exceptional scalability across diverse tasks. To further enhance its multi-task capabilities and address potential task interference, we devise a novel \textbf{Prior \textbf{P}ool}, a simple yet comprehensive mechanism that combines both local high-frequency features and global low-frequency features. Additionally, we design the \textbf{Prior \textbf{F}usion \textbf{M}odule (PFM)}, which enables the model to adaptively select the most relevant prior information for each specific task. Extensive experiments show that the versatile Uni-DocDiff achieves performance comparable or even superior performance compared with task-specific expert models, and simultaneously holds the task scalability for seamless adaptation to new tasks.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel medical image segmentation network called TCSAFormer, addressing limitations of traditional transformer-based methods. TCSAFormer incorporates a Compressed Attention (CA) module, reducing computational complexity while enhancing token relationships. It also introduces a Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module for better local contextual and multiscale feature capture. Experimental evaluations on three datasets show that TCSAFormer outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy while maintaining lower computational overhead. This highlights the model's efficiency and accuracy trade-off, making it a promising approach for medical image segmentation tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable progress in medical image segmentation due to their superior ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, these methods typically suffer from two major limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models' ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention (CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones, significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information, thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces O-Bench, a visual question answering benchmark specifically focused on occlusion perception. It includes 1,365 images with semantically coherent occlusion scenarios and 4,588 question-answer pairs across five tasks. Evaluation of 22 multimodal large language models shows a significant performance gap compared to human baseline. Three failure patterns are identified: overly conservative bias, fragile gestalt prediction, and struggle with quantitative tasks. The study finds that model scaling and thinking process adjustments are insufficient to bridge the performance gap. The O-Bench benchmark aims to evaluate occlusion perception and inspire the development of models for enhanced visual intelligence.<br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.04059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Occlusion perception, a critical foundation for human-level spatial understanding, embodies the challenge of integrating visual recognition and reasoning. Though multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, their performance on occlusion perception remains under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce O-Bench, the first visual question answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for occlusion perception. Based on SA-1B, we construct 1,365 images featuring semantically coherent occlusion scenarios through a novel layered synthesis approach. Upon this foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five tailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive evaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a significant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find, cannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process. We further identify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias, a fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks. We believe O-Bench can not only provide a vital evaluation tool for occlusion perception, but also inspire the development of MLLMs for better visual intelligence. Our benchmark will be made publicly available upon paper publication.

<div> Keywords: remote sensing, segmentation networks, TNet-R, convolution, global-local feature interactions

Summary:
The article introduces the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a novel architecture designed to improve segmentation in remote sensing applications. TNet utilizes convolution and addition operations to integrate low-resolution features with higher-resolution features, allowing for a more effective blending of global contextual information and local details. By progressively fusing these features across decoding stages, TNet is able to learn spatially-aware convolutional kernels, resulting in improved segmentation accuracy. Specifically, the implementation of TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder (TNet-R) achieves competitive performance on benchmark datasets such as ISPRS Vaihingen, ISPRS Potsdam, and LoveDA. TNet-R demonstrates a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35%, 87.05%, and 52.19% on these respective datasets, while maintaining high computational efficiency. The code for TNet is publicly available for further research and development.

Abstract: In remote sensing, most segmentation networks adopt the UNet architecture, often incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance global-local feature interactions within decoder stages. However, these enhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a simple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition operations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global context) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across decoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn spatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local information in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder (TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves competitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\% on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\% on LoveDA, while maintaining high computational efficiency.

The article introduces 3D Super Resolution (3DSR), a new framework for improving visual quality in 3D reconstructions using an explicit 3D Gaussian-splatting-based scene representation. Unlike previous methods, 3DSR focuses on 3D consistency across views and does not require additional fine-tuning. By leveraging diffusion-based 2D super-resolution models, 3DSR enhances the resolution of scenes while maintaining structural coherence.

Abstract: We propose 3D Super Resolution (3DSR), a novel 3D Gaussian-splatting-based super-resolution framework that leverages off-the-shelf diffusion-based 2D super-resolution models. 3DSR encourages 3D consistency across views via the use of an explicit 3D Gaussian-splatting-based scene representation. This makes the proposed 3DSR different from prior work, such as image upsampling or the use of video super-resolution, which either don't consider 3D consistency or aim to incorporate 3D consistency implicitly. Notably, our method enhances visual quality without additional fine-tuning, ensuring spatial coherence within the reconstructed scene. We evaluate 3DSR on MipNeRF360 and LLFF data, demonstrating that it produces high-resolution results that are visually compelling, while maintaining structural consistency in 3D reconstructions. Code will be released.

arXiv:2508.04099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.

Summary: NEARL-CLIP presents a novel framework for enhancing computer-aided medical image analysis by integrating vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP. The Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer) dynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between modalities, fostering mutual enrichment of multi-modal medical knowledge. The Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA) technique decouples novel information from incremental knowledge, allowing for focused acquisition of new information and facilitating modality interaction.

arXiv:2508.04101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer-aided medical image analysis is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment planning, yet limited annotated datasets restrict medical-specific model development. While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong generalization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging analysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge this gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction techniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single modality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality misalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs. In this paper, we propose \textbf{NEARL-CLIP} (i\underline{N}teracted qu\underline{E}ry \underline{A}daptation with o\underline{R}thogona\underline{L} Regularization), a novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two contributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which dynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between modalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal medical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA). OCA introduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from USEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the incremental knowledge. By isolating the learning process from the interference of incremental knowledge, OCA enables a more focused acquisition of new information, thereby further facilitating modality interaction and unleashing the capability of VLMs. Notably, NEARL-CLIP achieves these two contributions in a parameter-efficient style, which only introduces \textbf{1.46M} learnable parameters.

Abstract: Human perception studies can provide complementary insights to qualitative evaluation for understanding computer vision (CV) model performance. However, conducting human perception studies remains a non-trivial task, it often requires complex, end-to-end system setups that are time-consuming and difficult to scale. In this paper, we explore the unique opportunity presented by augmented reality (AR) for helping CV researchers to conduct perceptual studies. We design ARCADE, an evaluation platform that allows researchers to easily leverage AR's rich context and interactivity for human-centered CV evaluation. Specifically, ARCADE supports cross-platform AR data collection, custom experiment protocols via pluggable model inference, and AR streaming for user studies. We demonstrate ARCADE using two types of CV models, depth and lighting estimation and show that AR tasks can be effectively used to elicit human perceptual judgments of model quality. We also evaluate the systems usability and performance across different deployment and study settings, highlighting its flexibility and effectiveness as a human-centered evaluation platform.

Summary:
MMLSeg is introduced as a novel framework for Reference Expression Segmentation, optimizing visual detail features inherent in MLLMs without additional visual encoders. The proposed detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) effectively integrates visual and semantic features. A lightweight mask decoder with 34M parameters combines spatial and semantic features for precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments show MLLMSeg outperforms existing methods, striking a better balance between performance and cost. The code for MLLMSeg is available on GitHub for further research and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.04107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding, their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction. Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost.

Abstract: Vehicles, as one of the most common and significant objects in the real world, the researches on which using computer vision technologies have made remarkable progress, such as vehicle detection, vehicle re-identification, etc. To search an interested vehicle from the surveillance videos, existing methods first pre-detect and store all vehicle patches, and then apply vehicle re-identification models, which is resource-intensive and not very practical. In this work, we aim to achieve the joint detection and re-identification for vehicle search. However, the conflicting objectives between detection that focuses on shared vehicle commonness and re-identification that focuses on individual vehicle uniqueness make it challenging for a model to learn in an end-to-end system. For this problem, we propose a new unified framework, namely CLIPVehicle, which contains a dual-granularity semantic-region alignment module to leverage the VLMs (Vision-Language Models) for vehicle discrimination modeling, and a multi-level vehicle identification learning strategy to learn the identity representation from global, instance and feature levels. We also construct a new benchmark, including a real-world dataset CityFlowVS, and two synthetic datasets SynVS-Day and SynVS-All, for vehicle search. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods of both vehicle Re-ID and person search tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents OC-DiT, a novel class of diffusion models designed for object-centric prediction, and applies it to zero-shot instance segmentation. We propose a conditional latent diffusion framework that generates instance masks by conditioning the generative process on object templates and image features within the diffusion model's latent space. This allows our model to effectively disentangle object instances through the diffusion process, which is guided by visual object descriptors and localized image cues. Specifically, we introduce two model variants: a coarse model for generating initial object instance proposals, and a refinement model that refines all proposals in parallel. We train these models on a newly created, large-scale synthetic dataset comprising thousands of high-quality object meshes. Remarkably, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging real-world benchmarks, without requiring any retraining on target data. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate the potential of diffusion models for instance segmentation tasks.

The study challenges the prevailing belief in underwater image enhancement techniques by demonstrating that single-scale feature extraction can achieve or exceed the performance of multi-scale methods while reducing complexity. They propose the innovative Single-Scale Decomposition Network (SSD-Net) that disentangles input images into clean and degradation layers to effectively enhance degradation decoupling. The architecture combines CNN's local feature extraction with Transformer's global modeling through two core modules: Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB) and Bidirectional Feature Communication Block (BFCB.

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques aim to improve visual quality of images captured in aquatic environments by addressing degradation issues caused by light absorption and scattering effects, including color distortion, blurring, and low contrast. Current mainstream solutions predominantly employ multi-scale feature extraction (MSFE) mechanisms to enhance reconstruction quality through multi-resolution feature fusion. However, our extensive experiments demonstrate that high-quality image reconstruction does not necessarily rely on multi-scale feature fusion. Contrary to popular belief, our experiments show that single-scale feature extraction alone can match or surpass the performance of multi-scale methods, significantly reducing complexity. To comprehensively explore single-scale feature potential in underwater enhancement, we propose an innovative Single-Scale Decomposition Network (SSD-Net). This architecture introduces an asymmetrical decomposition mechanism that disentangles input image into clean layer along with degradation layer. The former contains scene-intrinsic information and the latter encodes medium-induced interference. It uniquely combines CNN's local feature extraction capabilities with Transformer's global modeling strengths through two core modules: 1) Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB), implementing dual-branch feature space decoupling via efficient attention operations and adaptive sparse transformer; 2) Bidirectional Feature Communication Block (BFCB), enabling cross-layer residual interactions for complementary feature mining and fusion. This synergistic design preserves feature decomposition independence while establishing dynamic cross-layer information pathways, effectively enhancing degradation decoupling capacity.

<title>Learning Using Privileged Information for Litter Detection</title>

Abstract: As litter pollution continues to rise globally, developing automated tools capable of detecting litter effectively remains a significant challenge. This study presents a novel approach that combines, for the first time, privileged information with deep learning object detection to improve litter detection while maintaining model efficiency. We evaluate our method across five widely used object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small litter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this, a key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of encoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the detection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both within-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset evaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate consistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only bolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well to other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved without increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring computational efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that this methodology offers a practical solution for litter detection, balancing accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.

Abstract: Deception detection is a critical task in real-world applications such as security screening, fraud prevention, and credibility assessment. While deep learning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance, their effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and diverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on single-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation caused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025 Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate cross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants are required to develop models that not only perform well within individual domains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By leveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge encourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit deceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of more adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection systems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning. By the conclusion of the workshop competition, a total of 21 teams had submitted their final results. https://sites.google.com/view/svc-mm25 for more information.

<title>DS$^2$Net: Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network for Medical Image Segmentation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.04131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Supervision Networks exhibit significant efficacy for the medical imaging community. Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical image analysis.

<title>UniFGVC: Universal Training-Free Few-Shot Fine-Grained Vision Classification via Attribute-Aware Multimodal Retrieval</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04136</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.04136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12 FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

<title>IDCNet: Guided Video Diffusion for Metric-Consistent RGBD Scene Generation with Precise Camera Control</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04147</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.04147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present IDC-Net (Image-Depth Consistency Network), a novel framework designed to generate RGB-D video sequences under explicit camera trajectory control. Unlike approaches that treat RGB and depth generation separately, IDC-Net jointly synthesizes both RGB images and corresponding depth maps within a unified geometry-aware diffusion model. The joint learning framework strengthens spatial and geometric alignment across frames, enabling more precise camera control in the generated sequences. To support the training of this camera-conditioned model and ensure high geometric fidelity, we construct a camera-image-depth consistent dataset with metric-aligned RGB videos, depth maps, and accurate camera poses, which provides precise geometric supervision with notably improved inter-frame geometric consistency. Moreover, we introduce a geometry-aware transformer block that enables fine-grained camera control, enhancing control over the generated sequences. Extensive experiments show that IDC-Net achieves improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both visual quality and geometric consistency of generated scene sequences. Notably, the generated RGB-D sequences can be directly feed for downstream 3D Scene reconstruction tasks without extra post-processing steps, showcasing the practical benefits of our joint learning framework.

<title>ICM-Fusion: In-Context Meta-Optimized LoRA Fusion for Multi-Task Adaptation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04153</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.04153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling multi-task adaptation in pre-trained Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) models is crucial for enhancing their generalization capabilities. Most existing pre-trained LoRA fusion methods decompose weight matrices, sharing similar parameters while merging divergent ones. However, this paradigm inevitably induces inter-weight conflicts and leads to catastrophic domain forgetting. While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it struggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios. Consequently, when the weight data follows a long-tailed distribution, it can lead to forgetting in the fused weights. To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA Fusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with in-context adaptation. The key innovation lies in our task vector arithmetic, which dynamically balances conflicting optimization directions across domains through learned manifold projections. ICM-Fusion obtains the optimal task vector orientation for the fused model in the latent space by adjusting the orientation of the task vectors. Subsequently, the fused LoRA is reconstructed by a self-designed Fusion VAE (F-VAE) to realize multi-task LoRA generation. We have conducted extensive experiments on visual and linguistic tasks, and the experimental results demonstrate that ICM-Fusion can be adapted to a wide range of architectural models and applied to various tasks. Compared to the current pre-trained LoRA fusion method, ICM-Fusion fused LoRA can significantly reduce the multi-tasking loss and can even achieve task enhancement in few-shot scenarios.

<title>Audio-Assisted Face Video Restoration with Temporal and Identity Complementary Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Face videos accompanied by audio have become integral to our daily lives, while they often suffer from complex degradations. Most face video restoration methods neglect the intrinsic correlations between the visual and audio features, especially in mouth regions. A few audio-aided face video restoration methods have been proposed, but they only focus on compression artifact removal. In this paper, we propose a General Audio-assisted face Video restoration Network (GAVN) to address various types of streaming video distortions via identity and temporal complementary learning. Specifically, GAVN first captures inter-frame temporal features in the low-resolution space to restore frames coarsely and save computational cost. Then, GAVN extracts intra-frame identity features in the high-resolution space with the assistance of audio signals and face landmarks to restore more facial details. Finally, the reconstruction module integrates temporal features and identity features to generate high-quality face videos. Experimental results demonstrate that GAVN outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on face video compression artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution. Codes will be released upon publication.

<title>ToxicTAGS: Decoding Toxic Memes with Rich Tag Annotations</title>

arXiv:2508.04166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2025 Global Risks Report identifies state-based armed conflict and societal polarisation among the most pressing global threats, with social media playing a central role in amplifying toxic discourse. Memes, as a widely used mode of online communication, often serve as vehicles for spreading harmful content. However, limitations in data accessibility and the high cost of dataset curation hinder the development of robust meme moderation systems. To address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset of 6,300 real-world meme-based posts annotated in two stages: (i) binary classification into toxic and normal, and (ii) fine-grained labelling of toxic memes as hateful, dangerous, or offensive. A key feature of this dataset is that it is enriched with auxiliary metadata of socially relevant tags, enhancing the context of each meme. In addition, we propose a tag generation module that produces socially grounded tags, because most in-the-wild memes often do not come with tags. Experimental results show that incorporating these tags substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs detection tasks. Our contributions offer a novel and scalable foundation for improved content moderation in multimodal online environments.

<title>AD-FM: Multimodal LLMs for Anomaly Detection via Multi-Stage Reasoning and Fine-Grained Reward Optimization</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04175</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04175</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.04175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, their application to specialized anomaly detection (AD) remains constrained by domain adaptation challenges. Existing Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based approaches suffer from two critical limitations: inadequate training data utilization when models produce uniform responses, and insufficient supervision over reasoning processes that encourage immediate binary decisions without deliberative analysis. We propose a comprehensive framework addressing these limitations through two synergistic innovations. First, we introduce a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process that guides models from region identification to focused examination, generating diverse response patterns essential for GRPO optimization while enabling structured supervision over analytical workflows. Second, we develop a fine-grained reward mechanism incorporating classification accuracy and localization supervision, transforming binary feedback into continuous signals that distinguish genuine analytical insight from spurious correctness. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple industrial datasets demonstrates substantial performance improvements in adapting general vision-language models to specialized anomaly detection. Our method achieves superior accuracy with efficient adaptation of existing annotations, effectively bridging the gap between general-purpose MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained visual discrimination required for detecting subtle manufacturing defects and structural irregularities.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.04176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement approaches primarily focus on architectural innovations, while often overlooking the intrinsic uncertainty within feature representations particularly under extremely dark conditions where degraded gradient and noise dominance severely impair model reliability and causal reasoning. To address these issues, we propose U2CLLIE, a novel framework that integrates uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color causal correlation modeling. From the perspective of entropy-based uncertainty, our framework introduces two key components: (1) An Uncertainty-Aware Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module, which leverages Gaussian-Guided Adaptive Frequency Domain Feature Enhancement (G2AF) to suppress frequency-domain noise and optimize entropy-driven representations. This module enhances spatial texture extraction and frequency-domain noise suppression/structure refinement, effectively mitigating gradient vanishing and noise dominance. (2) A hierarchical causality-aware framework, where a Luminance Enhancement Network (LEN) first performs coarse brightness enhancement on dark regions. Then, during the encoder-decoder phase, two asymmetric causal correlation modeling modules Neighborhood Correlation State Space (NeCo) and Adaptive Spatial-Color Calibration (AsC) collaboratively construct hierarchical causal constraints. These modules reconstruct and reinforce neighborhood structure and color consistency in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets, exhibiting robust performance and strong generalization across various scenes.

Abstract: There have been attempts to create large-scale structures in vision models similar to LLM, such as ViT-22B. While this research has provided numerous analyses and insights, our understanding of its practical utility remains incomplete. Therefore, we examine how this model structure reacts and train in a local environment. We also highlight the instability in training and make some model modifications to stabilize it. The ViT-22B model, trained from scratch, overall outperformed ViT in terms of performance under the same parameter size. Additionally, we venture into the task of image generation, which has not been attempted in ViT-22B. We propose an image generation architecture using ViT and investigate which between ViT and ViT-22B is a more suitable structure for image generation.

<title>RPCANet++: Deep Interpretable Robust PCA for Sparse Object Segmentation</title>

arXiv:2508.04190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) decomposes an observation matrix into low-rank background and sparse object components. This capability has enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters, and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation.

<title>From Learning to Unlearning: Biomedical Security Protection in Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: The security of biomedical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has attracted increasing attention. However, training samples easily contain private information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect, potentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment. An intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content and retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant computational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning has emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by selectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while preserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no available datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection in biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built upon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic private data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets two key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is mistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally respond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where wrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset, leading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning Efficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance across different subsets. We evaluate five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med and find that these methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful knowledge from biomedical MLLMs, indicating significant room for improvement. This work establishes a new pathway for further research in this promising field.

Abstract: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) aims to answer questions by explicitly reading and reasoning about the text involved in a video. Most works in this field follow a frame-level framework which suffers from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, resulting in limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the Video TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel model termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result for each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is designed to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and textual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation. Then, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an instance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish spatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer. Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework. GAT outperforms existing Video TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods, and video large language models in both accuracy and inference speed. Notably, GAT surpasses the previous state-of-the-art Video TextVQA methods by 3.86\% in accuracy and achieves ten times of faster inference speed than video large language models.

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a leading clustering method. Two of its major shortcomings are the disjoint optimization process and the limited representation capacity. To address these issues, we propose a deep spectral clustering model (named BootSC), which jointly learns all stages of spectral clustering -- affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and $k$-means clustering -- using a single network in an end-to-end manner. BootSC leverages effective and efficient optimal-transport-derived supervision to bootstrap the affinity matrix and the cluster assignment matrix. Moreover, a semantically-consistent orthogonal re-parameterization technique is introduced to orthogonalize spectral embeddings, significantly enhancing the discrimination capability. Experimental results indicate that BootSC achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance.

Abstract: In visual-language model (VLM) reasoning, false positive(FP) reasoning occurs when a model generates a correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning path. Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and reinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited generalization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for enhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and reasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset dependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates grounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object localization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then builds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning accuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning path to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought (CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby reducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy. Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess whether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in enhancing reasoning reliability.

Abstract: The diagnosis of medical diseases faces challenges such as the misdiagnosis of small lesions. Deep learning, particularly multimodal approaches, has shown great potential in the field of medical disease diagnosis. However, the differences in dimensionality between medical imaging and electronic health record data present challenges for effective alignment and fusion. To address these issues, we propose the Multimodal Multiscale Cross-Attention Fusion Network (MMCAF-Net). This model employs a feature pyramid structure combined with an efficient 3D multi-scale convolutional attention module to extract lesion-specific features from 3D medical images. To further enhance multimodal data integration, MMCAF-Net incorporates a multi-scale cross-attention module, which resolves dimensional inconsistencies, enabling more effective feature fusion. We evaluated MMCAF-Net on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, and the results showed a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/yjx1234/MMCAF-Net

Abstract: Standard segmentation setups are unable to deliver models that can recognize concepts outside the training taxonomy. Open-vocabulary approaches promise to close this gap through language-image pretraining on billions of image-caption pairs. Unfortunately, we observe that the promise is not delivered due to several bottlenecks that have caused the performance to plateau for almost two years. This paper proposes novel oracle components that identify and decouple these bottlenecks by taking advantage of the groundtruth information. The presented validation experiments deliver important empirical findings that provide a deeper insight into the failures of open-vocabulary models and suggest prominent approaches to unlock the future research.

<title>SplitGaussian: Reconstructing Dynamic Scenes via Visual Geometry Decomposition</title>

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video remains fundamentally challenging due to the need to jointly infer motion, structure, and appearance from limited observations. Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based on Gaussian Splatting often entangle static and dynamic elements in a shared representation, leading to motion leakage, geometric distortions, and temporal flickering. We identify that the root cause lies in the coupled modeling of geometry and appearance across time, which hampers both stability and interpretability. To address this, we propose \textbf{SplitGaussian}, a novel framework that explicitly decomposes scene representations into static and dynamic components. By decoupling motion modeling from background geometry and allowing only the dynamic branch to deform over time, our method prevents motion artifacts in static regions while supporting view- and time-dependent appearance refinement. This disentangled design not only enhances temporal consistency and reconstruction fidelity but also accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitGaussian outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality, geometric stability, and motion separation.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across diverse multimodal tasks by leveraging large-scale pre-training. However, enabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major challenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are particularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal continual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal feature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and zero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and systematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by identifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL. Based on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to their target problems: (1) \textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address cross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2) \textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during updates; and (3) \textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter interference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current evaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better benchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional generalization. Finally, we outline open problems and future directions, including continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning. This survey aims to serve as a comprehensive and diagnostic reference for researchers developing lifelong vision-language systems.

Abstract: Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a challenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios involving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect, primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

<title>Intention Enhanced Diffusion Model for Multimodal Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction</title>

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for path planning and motion control of autonomous vehicles. However, accurately forecasting crowd trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance.

Abstract: As black-box AI-driven decision-making systems become increasingly widespread in modern document processing workflows, improving their transparency and reliability has become critical, especially in high-stakes applications where biases or spurious correlations in decision-making could lead to serious consequences. One vital component often found in such document processing workflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use, remains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain the decisions of document image classification models through feature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail to provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document counterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's decision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose DocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination with classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual counterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise refinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target factual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a rigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document classification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3 different models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established evaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to explore generative counterfactual explanations in document image analysis.

Abstract: We consider the problem in Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) of identifying and classifying objects located on the ground by means of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Specifically, we adopt a single scattering approximation to classify the shape of the object using both simulated SAR data and reconstructed images from this data, and we compare the success of these approaches. We then identify ice types in real SAR imagery from the satellite Sentinel-1. In both experiments we achieve a promising high classification accuracy ($\geq$75\%). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in using SAR data for both geometric and environmental classification tasks. Our investigation also explores the effect of SAR data acquisition at different antenna heights on our ability to classify objects successfully.

<title>PIS3R: Very Large Parallax Image Stitching via Deep 3D Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Image stitching aim to align two images taken from different viewpoints into one seamless, wider image. However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations and the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the relative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most existing stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax effectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image stitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on the novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry grounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene reconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto a designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving pixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to further address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial stitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the refined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large parallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric integrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct applicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for images with very large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: The study of rodent social behavior has shifted in the last years from relying on direct human observation to more nuanced approaches integrating computational methods in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. While conventional approaches introduce bias and can fail to capture the complexity of rodent social interactions, modern approaches bridging computer vision, ethology and neuroscience provide more multifaceted insights into behavior which are particularly relevant to social neuroscience. Despite these benefits, the integration of AI into social behavior research also poses several challenges. Here we discuss the main steps involved and the tools available for analyzing rodent social behavior, examining their advantages and limitations. Additionally, we suggest practical solutions to address common hurdles, aiming to guide young researchers in adopting these methods and to stimulate further discussion among experts regarding the evolving requirements of these tools in scientific applications.

<title>Segment Any Vehicle: Semantic and Visual Context Driven SAM and A Benchmark</title>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception, particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge. Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. % Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released upon acceptance. Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/SAV

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) seeks to incrementally learn to segment novel classes while preserving knowledge of previously encountered ones. Recent advancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained Vision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct Fine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes, remains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a performance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe catastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex mitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is flawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two standard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using two representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed probing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under DFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further investigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting primarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than from degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we propose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates strategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned classifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive experiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior performance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring substantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time.

Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) aims to retrieve a specific moment semantically related to the given query. To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods solely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the complementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to tackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally and simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval. These designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video moment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or background sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end, we propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which learns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts for VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and audio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance predictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly assigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we design a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and visual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their complementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation strategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference. To evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e., Charades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and re-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability in utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving state-of-the-art with audio-video fusion in VMR methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/IMG.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a classical topic in the field of 3D Vision and Computer Graphics. Generally, the implementation of registration is typically sensitive to similarity transformations (translation, scaling, and rotation), noisy points, and incomplete geometric structures. Especially, the non-uniform scales and defective parts of point clouds increase probability of struck local optima in registration task. In this paper, we propose a robust point cloud registration PKSS-Align that can handle various influences, including similarity transformations, non-uniform densities, random noisy points, and defective parts. The proposed method measures shape feature-based similarity between point clouds on the Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS), \textcolor{black}{which is a shape measurement-based scheme and doesn't require point-to-point or point-to-plane metric.} The employed measurement can be regarded as the manifold metric that is robust to various representations in the Euclidean coordinate system. Benefited from the measurement, the transformation matrix can be directly generated for point clouds with mentioned influences at the same time. The proposed method does not require data training and complex feature encoding. Based on a simple parallel acceleration, it can achieve significant improvement for efficiency and feasibility in practice. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the relevant state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We present Multi-Baseline Gaussian Splatting (MuRF), a generalized feed-forward approach for novel view synthesis that effectively handles diverse baseline settings, including sparse input views with both small and large baselines. Specifically, we integrate features from Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) to enhance feature representations for generalizable reconstruction. Next, We propose a projection-and-sampling mechanism for deep depth fusion, which constructs a fine probability volume to guide the regression of the feature map. Furthermore, We introduce a reference-view loss to improve geometry and optimization efficiency. We leverage 3D Gaussian representations to accelerate training and inference time while enhancing rendering quality. MuRF achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple baseline settings and diverse scenarios ranging from simple objects (DTU) to complex indoor and outdoor scenes (RealEstate10K). We also demonstrate promising zero-shot performance on the LLFF and Mip-NeRF 360 datasets.

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) is a highly challenging task aiming to localize the temporal segment within an untrimmed video corresponding to a given natural language description. Benefiting from the design of learnable queries, the DETR-based models have achieved substantial advancements in the TSG task. However, the absence of explicit supervision often causes the learned queries to overlap in roles, leading to redundant predictions. Therefore, we propose to improve TSG by making each query fulfill its designated role, leveraging the length priors of the video-description pairs. In this paper, we introduce the Length-Aware Transformer (LATR) for TSG, which assigns different queries to handle predictions based on varying temporal lengths. Specifically, we divide all queries into three groups, responsible for segments with short, middle, and long temporal durations, respectively. During training, an additional length classification task is introduced. Predictions from queries with mismatched lengths are suppressed, guiding each query to specialize in its designated function. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our LATR, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks. Furthermore, the ablation studies validate the contribution of each component of our method and the critical role of incorporating length priors into the TSG task.

Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications across various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder, named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples, encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322% of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT) method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality, efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal recognition models in the DAS domain.

Abstract: Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches: sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming, we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces two key innovations: (i) a trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; and (ii) a noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later phases. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art performance in human preference alignment and standard text-to-image benchmarks.

<title>RiemanLine: Riemannian Manifold Representation of 3D Lines for Factor Graph Optimization</title>

Abstract: Minimal parametrization of 3D lines plays a critical role in camera localization and structural mapping. Existing representations in robotics and computer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural regularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made environments. This paper introduces \textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal representation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly accommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to decouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared vanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled normal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding of structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation reduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally embedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this parameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction alignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based bundle adjustment. Extensive experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly more accurate pose estimation and line reconstruction, while reducing parameter dimensionality and improving convergence stability.

Abstract: Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) seeks to recover high-fidelity surface shapes and reflectances from images captured under varying views and illuminations. However, existing MVPS methods often require controlled darkroom settings for varying illuminations or overlook the recovery of reflectances and illuminations properties, limiting their applicability in natural illumination scenarios and downstream inverse rendering tasks. In this paper, we propose RotatedMVPS to solve shape and reflectance recovery under rotated natural light, achievable with a practical rotation stage. By ensuring light consistency across different camera and object poses, our method reduces the unknowns associated with complex environment light. Furthermore, we integrate data priors from off-the-shelf learning-based single-view photometric stereo methods into our MVPS framework, significantly enhancing the accuracy of shape and reflectance recovery. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs' context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile, building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning. Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and video Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge Video-MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that vision models pre-trained on images can perform well in time series forecasting by reformulating forecasting as an image reconstruction task, suggesting their potential as universal time series foundation models. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2) a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive prior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \model achieves SOTA results, outperforming specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12 probabilistic forecasting settings. Our work establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing the development of universal TSFMs.

arXiv:2508.04381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ear biometrics offer a stable and contactless modality for identity recognition, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of annotated data and significant intra-class variability. Existing methods typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation, restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework, ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction. Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets demonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1 identification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as 0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited data conditions.

Abstract: Renovating existing buildings is essential for climate impact. Early-phase renovation planning requires simulations based on thermal 3D models at Level of Detail (LoD) 3, which include features like windows. However, scalable and accurate identification of such features remains a challenge. This paper presents the Scalable Image-to-3D Facade Parser (SI3FP), a pipeline that generates LoD3 thermal models by extracting geometries from images using both computer vision and deep learning. Unlike existing methods relying on segmentation and projection, SI3FP directly models geometric primitives in the orthographic image plane, providing a unified interface while reducing perspective distortions. SI3FP supports both sparse (e.g., Google Street View) and dense (e.g., hand-held camera) data sources. Tested on typical Swedish residential buildings, SI3FP achieved approximately 5% error in window-to-wall ratio estimates, demonstrating sufficient accuracy for early-stage renovation analysis. The pipeline facilitates large-scale energy renovation planning and has broader applications in urban development and planning.

Abstract: The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video scenarios. All code, data and model weight will be made publicly available.

<title>Think Before You Segment: An Object-aware Reasoning Agent for Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects in audible videos based on given reference expressions. Prior works typically rely on learning latent embeddings via multimodal fusion to prompt a tunable SAM/SAM2 decoder for segmentation, which requires strong pixel-level supervision and lacks interpretability. From a novel perspective of explicit reference understanding, we propose TGS-Agent, which decomposes the task into a Think-Ground-Segment process, mimicking the human reasoning procedure by first identifying the referred object through multimodal analysis, followed by coarse-grained grounding and precise segmentation. To this end, we first propose Ref-Thinker, a multimodal language model capable of reasoning over textual, visual, and auditory cues. We construct an instruction-tuning dataset with explicit object-aware think-answer chains for Ref-Thinker fine-tuning. The object description inferred by Ref-Thinker is used as an explicit prompt for Grounding-DINO and SAM2, which perform grounding and segmentation without relying on pixel-level supervision. Additionally, we introduce R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench, a new benchmark with linguistically diverse and reasoning-intensive references for better evaluating model generalization. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on both standard Ref-AVSBench and proposed R\textsuperscript{2}-AVSBench. Code will be available at https://github.com/jasongief/TGS-Agent.

<title>Efficient Inter-Task Attention for Multitask Transformer Models</title>

arXiv:2508.04422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In both Computer Vision and the wider Deep Learning field, the Transformer architecture is well-established as state-of-the-art for many applications. For Multitask Learning, however, where there may be many more queries necessary compared to single-task models, its Multi-Head-Attention often approaches the limits of what is computationally feasible considering practical hardware limitations. This is due to the fact that the size of the attention matrix scales quadratically with the number of tasks (assuming roughly equal numbers of queries for all tasks). As a solution, we propose our novel Deformable Inter-Task Self-Attention for Multitask models that enables the much more efficient aggregation of information across the feature maps from different tasks. In our experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets, we demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in both FLOPs count and inference latency. At the same time, we also achieve substantial improvements by up to 7.4% in the individual tasks' prediction quality metrics.

Abstract: Retrieving fine-grained visual content based on user intent remains a challenge in multi-modal systems. Although current Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) methods combine reference images with retrieval texts, they are constrained to image-level matching and cannot localize specific objects. To this end, we propose Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a brand-new task that goes beyond image-level retrieval to achieve object-level precision, allowing the retrieval and segmentation of target objects based on composed expressions combining reference objects and retrieval texts. COR presents significant challenges in retrieval flexibility, which requires systems to identify arbitrary objects satisfying composed expressions while avoiding semantically similar but irrelevant negative objects within the same scene. We construct COR127K, the first large-scale COR benchmark that contains 127,166 retrieval triplets with various semantic transformations in 408 categories. We also present CORE, a unified end-to-end model that integrates reference region encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE significantly outperforms existing models in both base and novel categories, establishing a simple and effective baseline for this challenging task while opening new directions for fine-grained multi-modal retrieval research.

<title>Benchmarking Foundation Models for Mitotic Figure Classification</title>

Abstract: The performance of deep learning models is known to scale with data quantity and diversity. In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited. Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models, that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing, reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still yields competitive performance.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have experienced significant advancements in recent years. However, their performance still falls short in tasks requiring deep visual perception, such as identifying subtle differences between images. A potential cause is the scarcity of visual knowledge in popular instruction-tuning corpora, resulting in inadequate visual perception and reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a self-improvement framework grounded in a novel visual knowledge-intensive task, \underline{C}ausality-driven \underline{V}isual object \underline{C}ompletion (CVC). This task requires LVLMs to infer the masked object in an image based on its \textit{causal} relationships with the other visible information. We first obtain rich examples cheaply through our automated instance construction pipeline, without relying on sophisticated LVLMs (\textit{e.g.}, GPT-4V) or human assistance. Then, LVLMs effectively self-improve through trial and error learning using these created instances. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains across four challenging specialized tasks and four widely-used comprehensive benchmarks. Especially on specialized tasks, our method achieves an average improvement of 5.4\% and 4.0\% compared to the corresponding baselines when utilizing LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/XMUDeepLIT/CVC.

Abstract: Given the high complexity of directly generating high-dimensional data such as 4D, we present 4DVD, a cascaded video diffusion model that generates 4D content in a decoupled manner. Unlike previous multi-view video methods that directly model 3D space and temporal features simultaneously with stacked cross view/temporal attention modules, 4DVD decouples this into two subtasks: coarse multi-view layout generation and structure-aware conditional generation, and effectively unifies them. Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first predicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and temporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware spatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse structural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular video to generate final high-quality dense-view videos. Benefit from this, explicit 4D representation~(such as 4D Gaussian) can be optimized accurately, enabling wider practical application. To train 4DVD, we collect a dynamic 3D object dataset, called D-Objaverse, from the Objaverse benchmark and render 16 videos with 21 frames for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and 4D generation. Our project page is https://4dvd.github.io/

arXiv:2508.04469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of vision-language models remains constrained by substantial computational requirements. We present \textbf{FrEVL}, a framework exploring whether frozen pretrained embeddings can support effective vision-language understanding. Our analysis reveals that frozen embeddings contain rich information for discriminative tasks, achieving 85\% to 95\% of state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks with only 68.4M trainable parameters. This performance dichotomy reveals a critical insight: frozen embedding effectiveness depends on alignment between pretraining objectives and downstream task requirements. When accounting for end-to-end computation including embedding extraction, FrEVL provides $2.3\times$ speedup with 52\% lower energy consumption, making it suitable for scenarios with pre-computable inputs or when deployment constraints outweigh marginal performance gains. Our evaluation provides practitioners with guidance on when frozen embedding approaches represent viable alternatives to full model deployment. We will release our complete implementation and evaluation framework to facilitate further research into efficient multi-modal understanding.

<title>Zero-Residual Concept Erasure via Progressive Alignment in Text-to-Image Model</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.04472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concept Erasure, which aims to prevent pretrained text-to-image models from generating content associated with semantic-harmful concepts (i.e., target concepts), is getting increased attention. State-of-the-art methods formulate this task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with semantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update the model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue that existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in incomplete erasure due to "non-zero alignment residual", especially when text prompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality degradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers. To address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is designed for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall generative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict zero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect alignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete erasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that gradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from shallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes diminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving generative quality. Empirical results across different concept erasure tasks (including instance, art style, and nudity erasure) have demonstrated the effectiveness of our ErasePro.

arXiv:2508.04485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have shown superior performance in real-world video super-resolution (VSR). However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource consumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and deployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR model. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal characteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we propose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the calibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each layer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the low-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine the FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition, we propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased quantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model and significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods. Code is available at: https://github.com/bowenchai/QuantVSR.

Abstract: Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest during the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and robustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the property that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the intervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state. While most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the variables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on representations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an effective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to focus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically, we propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding that is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal variables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is capable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any additional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate that Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings, significantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.

Abstract: Reconstructing realistic 3D human avatars from monocular videos is a challenging task due to the limited geometric information and complex non-rigid motion involved. We present MonoCloth, a new method for reconstructing and animating clothed human avatars from monocular videos. To overcome the limitations of monocular input, we introduce a part-based decomposition strategy that separates the avatar into body, face, hands, and clothing. This design reflects the varying levels of reconstruction difficulty and deformation complexity across these components. Specifically, we focus on detailed geometry recovery for the face and hands. For clothing, we propose a dedicated cloth simulation module that captures garment deformation using temporal motion cues and geometric constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MonoCloth improves both visual reconstruction quality and animation realism compared to existing methods. Furthermore, thanks to its part-based design, MonoCloth also supports additional tasks such as clothing transfer, underscoring its versatility and practical utility.

In contrast, existing unsupervised temporal action segmentation methods have focused primarily on video data, while skeleton sequences remain underexplored, despite their relevance to real-world applications, robustness, and privacy-preserving nature. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for unsupervised skeleton-based temporal action segmentation. Our method utilizes a sequence-to-sequence temporal autoencoder that keeps the information of the different joints disentangled in the embedding space. Latent skeleton sequences are then divided into non-overlapping patches and quantized to obtain distinctive skeleton motion words, driving the discovery of semantically meaningful action clusters. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach on three widely used skeleton-based datasets, namely HuGaDB, LARa, and BABEL. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art unsupervised temporal action segmentation methods. Code is available at https://github.com/bachlab/SMQ .

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation. Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX (Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps, eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for modern healthcare and is a key element of computer-aided diagnosis. While recent advancements in computer vision have explored unsupervised segmentation using pre-trained models, these methods have not been translated well to the medical imaging domain. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that fine-tunes pre-trained models specifically for medical images, achieving accurate segmentation with extensive processing. Our method integrates Explainable AI to generate relevance scores, enhancing the segmentation process. Unlike traditional methods that excel in standard benchmarks but falter in medical applications, our approach achieves improved results on datasets like CBIS-DDSM, NuInsSeg and Kvasir-SEG.

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD) predominantly emphasize feature-level knowledge transfer, frequently overlooking critical information embedded within the teacher's logit distributions. In this paper, we revisit logit-based distillation and reveal an underexplored yet critical element: Top-K knowledge. Motivated by this insight, we propose Top-scaled Knowledge Distillation (TopKD), a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic framework that significantly enhances logit-based distillation. TopKD consists of two main components: (1) a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM), which adaptively amplifies the most informative logits, and (2) a Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL), which offers targeted and effective supervision. Notably, TopKD integrates seamlessly into existing KD methods without introducing extra modules or requiring architectural changes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that TopKD consistently surpasses state-of-the-art distillation methods. Moreover, our method demonstrates substantial effectiveness when distilling Vision Transformers, underscoring its versatility across diverse network architectures. These findings highlight the significant potential of logits to advance knowledge distillation.

arXiv:2508.04540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present InceptoFormer, a multi-signal neural framework designed for Parkinson's Disease (PD) severity evaluation via gait dynamics analysis. Our architecture introduces a 1D adaptation of the Inception model, which we refer to as Inception1D, along with a Transformer-based framework to stage PD severity according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&amp;Y) scale. The Inception1D component captures multi-scale temporal features by employing parallel 1D convolutional filters with varying kernel sizes, thereby extracting features across multiple temporal scales. The transformer component efficiently models long-range dependencies within gait sequences, providing a comprehensive understanding of both local and global patterns. To address the issue of class imbalance in PD severity staging, we propose a data structuring and preprocessing strategy based on oversampling to enhance the representation of underrepresented severity levels. The overall design enables to capture fine-grained temporal variations and global dynamics in gait signal, significantly improving classification performance for PD severity evaluation. Through extensive experimentation, InceptoFormer achieves an accuracy of 96.6%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in PD severity assessment. The source code for our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/SafwenNaimi/InceptoFormer

arXiv:2508.04546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of online video temporal grounding (OnVTG), which requires the model to locate events related to a given text query within a video stream. Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the model to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are streaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient to store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to store recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating whether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target event. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain long-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these challenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an event-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals that model event-level information with various durations. To preserve historically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event memory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent and long-term information. To enable the real-time prediction, we further propose a future prediction branch that predicts whether the target event will occur shortly and further regresses the start time of the event. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the TACoS, ActivityNet Captions, and MAD datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/minghangz/OnVTG.

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion, and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets, typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation. Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at https://msc.hkustvgd.com.

Abstract: While recent advances in virtual try-on (VTON) have achieved realistic garment transfer to human subjects, its inverse task, virtual try-off (VTOFF), which aims to reconstruct canonical garment templates from dressed humans, remains critically underexplored and lacks systematic investigation. Existing works predominantly treat them as isolated tasks: VTON focuses on garment dressing while VTOFF addresses garment extraction, thereby neglecting their complementary symmetry. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose the Two-Way Garment Transfer Model (TWGTM), to the best of our knowledge, the first unified framework for joint clothing-centric image synthesis that simultaneously resolves both mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF through bidirectional feature disentanglement. Specifically, our framework employs dual-conditioned guidance from both latent and pixel spaces of reference images to seamlessly bridge the dual tasks. On the other hand, to resolve the inherent mask dependency asymmetry between mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF, we devise a phased training paradigm that progressively bridges this modality gap. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across the DressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of our proposed approach.

<title>Augmentation-based Domain Generalization and Joint Training from Multiple Source Domains for Whole Heart Segmentation</title>

Abstract: As the leading cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases motivate the development of more sophisticated methods to analyze the heart and its substructures from medical images like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance (MR). Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that represent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac morphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be used to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g. electrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though deep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great advancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain shift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data distributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known at training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that utilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains. Further, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at test-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques to greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart segmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the best performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best performance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT. With 93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR data, our method demonstrates great potential to efficiently obtain accurate semantic segmentations from which patient-specific cardiac twin models can be generated.

<title>One Model For All: Partial Diffusion for Unified Try-On and Try-Off in Any Pose</title>

arXiv:2508.04559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant advances in image-based virtual try-on, enabling more realistic and end-to-end garment synthesis. However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality in real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{OMFA} (\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition garments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing garments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target person (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel poses-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built upon a novel \emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise and denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment, the person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient bidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely mask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input, making it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose try-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a practical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis.

Abstract: The diffusion of drones presents significant security and safety challenges. Traditional surveillance systems, particularly conventional frame-based cameras, struggle to reliably detect these targets due to their small size, high agility, and the resulting motion blur and poor performance in challenging lighting conditions. This paper surveys the emerging field of event-based vision as a robust solution to these problems. Event cameras virtually eliminate motion blur and enable consistent detection in extreme lighting. Their sparse, asynchronous output suppresses static backgrounds, enabling low-latency focus on motion cues. We review the state-of-the-art in event-based drone detection, from data representation methods to advanced processing pipelines using spiking neural networks. The discussion extends beyond simple detection to cover more sophisticated tasks such as real-time tracking, trajectory forecasting, and unique identification through propeller signature analysis. By examining current methodologies, available datasets, and the distinct advantages of the technology, this work demonstrates that event-based vision provides a powerful foundation for the next generation of reliable, low-latency, and efficient counter-UAV systems.

Abstract: Orthodontic treatment hinges on tooth alignment, which significantly affects occlusal function, facial aesthetics, and patients' quality of life. Current deep learning approaches predominantly concentrate on predicting transformation matrices through imposing point-to-point geometric constraints for tooth alignment. Nevertheless, these matrices are likely associated with the anatomical structure of the human oral cavity and possess particular distribution characteristics that the deterministic point-to-point geometric constraints in prior work fail to capture. To address this, we introduce a new automatic tooth alignment method named TAlignDiff, which is supported by diffusion-based transformation learning. TAlignDiff comprises two main components: a primary point cloud-based regression network (PRN) and a diffusion-based transformation matrix denoising module (DTMD). Geometry-constrained losses supervise PRN learning for point cloud-level alignment. DTMD, as an auxiliary module, learns the latent distribution of transformation matrices from clinical data. We integrate point cloud-based transformation regression and diffusion-based transformation modeling into a unified framework, allowing bidirectional feedback between geometric constraints and diffusion refinement. Extensive ablation and comparative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method, highlighting its potential in orthodontic treatment.

<title>CLASP: Cross-modal Salient Anchor-based Semantic Propagation for Weakly-supervised Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization</title>

Abstract: The Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization (DAVEL) task aims to temporally localize events in untrimmed videos that occur simultaneously in both the audio and visual modalities. This paper explores DAVEL under a new and more challenging weakly-supervised setting (W-DAVEL task), where only video-level event labels are provided and the temporal boundaries of each event are unknown. We address W-DAVEL by exploiting \textit{cross-modal salient anchors}, which are defined as reliable timestamps that are well predicted under weak supervision and exhibit highly consistent event semantics across audio and visual modalities. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Mutual Event Agreement Evaluation} module, which generates an agreement score by measuring the discrepancy between the predicted audio and visual event classes. Then, the agreement score is utilized in a \textit{Cross-modal Salient Anchor Identification} module, which identifies the audio and visual anchor features through global-video and local temporal window identification mechanisms. The anchor features after multimodal integration are fed into an \textit{Anchor-based Temporal Propagation} module to enhance event semantic encoding in the original temporal audio and visual features, facilitating better temporal localization under weak supervision. We establish benchmarks for W-DAVEL on both the UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<title>Analyzing and Mitigating Object Hallucination: A Training Bias Perspective</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.04567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from the hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual input. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of training data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which consists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs with certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we find that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage their training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during training. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often incorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand this issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components, revealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling (LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and lightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via training bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between ground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias and adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only updates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\% of the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong scalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data volume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond object-level hallucination. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Abstract: This paper presents DDTracking, a novel deep generative framework for diffusion MRI tractography that formulates streamline propagation as a conditional denoising diffusion process. In DDTracking, we introduce a dual-pathway encoding network that jointly models local spatial encoding (capturing fine-scale structural details at each streamline point) and global temporal dependencies (ensuring long-range consistency across the entire streamline). Furthermore, we design a conditional diffusion model module, which leverages the learned local and global embeddings to predict streamline propagation orientations for tractography in an end-to-end trainable manner. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation across diverse, independently acquired dMRI datasets, including both synthetic and clinical data. Experiments on two well-established benchmarks with ground truth (ISMRM Challenge and TractoInferno) demonstrate that DDTracking largely outperforms current state-of-the-art tractography methods. Furthermore, our results highlight DDTracking's strong generalizability across heterogeneous datasets, spanning varying health conditions, age groups, imaging protocols, and scanner types. Collectively, DDTracking offers anatomically plausible and robust tractography, presenting a scalable, adaptable, and end-to-end learnable solution for broad dMRI applications.

arXiv:2508.04572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of grounding abnormalities in medical images, where the goal is to localize clinical findings based on textual descriptions. While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural grounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare, compositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual patterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale domain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Knowledge to Sight (K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by decomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as shape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from domain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which guide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level supervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial structure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact models with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\% of the data required by state-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training data, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical VLMs, with up to 9.82\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$.

Abstract: Accurate skin disease classification is a critical yet challenging task due to high inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and complex lesion textures. While deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have shown promise in automating dermatological assessments, their performance is highly dependent on image pre-processing and model architecture. This study proposes a deep learning framework for multi-class skin disease classification, systematically evaluating three image pre-processing techniques: standard RGB, CMY color space transformation, and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). We benchmark the performance of pre-trained convolutional neural networks (DenseNet201, Efficient-NetB5) and transformer-based models (ViT, Swin Transformer, DinoV2 Large) using accuracy and F1-score as evaluation metrics. Results show that DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing achieves the highest accuracy (up to 93%) and F1-scores across all variants. Grad-CAM visualizations applied to RGB inputs further reveal precise lesion localization, enhancing interpretability. These findings underscore the importance of effective pre-processing and model choice in building robust and explainable CAD systems for dermatology.

Abstract: The advancements of technology have led to the use of multimodal systems in various real-world applications. Among them, audio-visual systems are among the most widely used multimodal systems. In the recent years, associating face and voice of a person has gained attention due to the presence of unique correlation between them. The Face-voice Association in Multilingual Environments (FAME) 2026 Challenge focuses on exploring face-voice association under the unique condition of a multilingual scenario. This condition is inspired from the fact that half of the world's population is bilingual and most often people communicate under multilingual scenarios. The challenge uses a dataset named Multilingual Audio-Visual (MAV-Celeb) for exploring face-voice association in multilingual environments. This report provides the details of the challenge, dataset, baseline models, and task details for the FAME Challenge.

Abstract: Incrementally recovering real-sized 3D geometry from a pose-free RGB stream is a challenging task in 3D reconstruction, requiring minimal assumptions on input data. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into end-to-end and visual SLAM-based approaches, both of which either struggle with long sequences or depend on slow test-time optimization and depth sensors. To address this, we first integrate a depth estimator into an RGB-D SLAM system, but this approach is hindered by inaccurate geometric details in predicted depth. Through further investigation, we find that 3D Gaussian mapping can effectively solve this problem. Building on this, we propose an online 3D reconstruction method using 3D Gaussian-based SLAM, combined with a feed-forward recurrent prediction module to directly infer camera pose from optical flow. This approach replaces slow test-time optimization with fast network inference, significantly improving tracking speed. Additionally, we introduce a local graph rendering technique to enhance robustness in feed-forward pose prediction. Experimental results on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets, along with a real-world deployment demonstration, show that our method achieves performance on par with the state-of-the-art SplaTAM, while reducing tracking time by more than 90\%.

Abstract: Monocular and stereo depth estimation offer complementary strengths: monocular methods capture rich contextual priors but lack geometric precision, while stereo approaches leverage epipolar geometry yet struggle with ambiguities such as reflective or textureless surfaces. Despite post-hoc synergies, these paradigms remain largely disjoint in practice. We introduce OmniDepth, a unified framework that bridges both through iterative bidirectional alignment of their latent representations. At its core, a novel cross-attentive alignment mechanism dynamically synchronizes monocular contextual cues with stereo hypothesis representations during stereo reasoning. This mutual alignment resolves stereo ambiguities (e.g., specular surfaces) by injecting monocular structure priors while refining monocular depth with stereo geometry within a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results: \textbf{OmniDepth reduces zero-shot generalization error by $\!>\!40\%$ on Middlebury and ETH3D}, while addressing longstanding failures on transparent and reflective surfaces. By harmonizing multi-view geometry with monocular context, OmniDepth enables robust 3D perception that transcends modality-specific limitations.

<title>How Does Bilateral Ear Symmetry Affect Deep Ear Features?</title>

Abstract: Ear recognition has gained attention as a reliable biometric technique due to the distinctive characteristics of human ears. With the increasing availability of large-scale datasets, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely adopted to learn features directly from raw ear images, outperforming traditional hand-crafted methods. However, the effect of bilateral ear symmetry on the features learned by CNNs has received little attention in recent studies. In this paper, we investigate how bilateral ear symmetry influences the effectiveness of CNN-based ear recognition. To this end, we first develop an ear side classifier to automatically categorize ear images as either left or right. We then explore the impact of incorporating this side information during both training and test. Cross-dataset evaluations are conducted on five datasets. Our results suggest that treating left and right ears separately during training and testing can lead to notable performance improvements. Furthermore, our ablation studies on alignment strategies, input sizes, and various hyperparameter settings provide practical insights into training CNN-based ear recognition systems on large-scale datasets to achieve higher verification rates.

Abstract: We present FinMMR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark tailored to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in financial numerical reasoning tasks. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work introduces three significant advancements. (1) Multimodality: We meticulously transform existing financial reasoning benchmarks, and construct novel questions from the latest Chinese financial research reports. FinMMR comprises 4.3K questions and 8.7K images spanning 14 categories, including tables, bar charts, and ownership structure charts. (2) Comprehensiveness: FinMMR encompasses 14 financial subdomains, including corporate finance, banking, and industry analysis, significantly exceeding existing benchmarks in financial domain knowledge breadth. (3) Challenge: Models are required to perform multi-step precise numerical reasoning by integrating financial knowledge with the understanding of complex financial images and text. The best-performing MLLM achieves only 53.0% accuracy on Hard problems. We believe that FinMMR will drive advancements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs in real-world scenarios.

<title>EncQA: Benchmarking Vision-Language Models on Visual Encodings for Charts</title>

Abstract: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) continue to achieve ever-improving scores on chart understanding benchmarks. Yet, we find that this progress does not fully capture the breadth of visual reasoning capabilities essential for interpreting charts. We introduce EncQA, a novel benchmark informed by the visualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual encodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. EncQA provides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of six visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color nominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find anomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value relative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across encodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to expectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for many task-encoding pairs. Our results suggest that advancing chart understanding requires targeted strategies addressing specific visual reasoning gaps, rather than solely scaling up model or dataset size.

<title>X-SAM: From Segment Anything to Any Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs. Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD) segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding. Code is available at https://github.com/wanghao9610/X-SAM.

Abstract: In the poultry industry, detecting chicken illnesses is essential to avoid financial losses. Conventional techniques depend on manual observation, which is laborious and prone to mistakes. Using YOLO v8 a deep learning model for real-time object recognition. This study suggests an AI based approach, by developing a system that analyzes high resolution chicken photos, YOLO v8 detects signs of illness, such as abnormalities in behavior and appearance. A sizable, annotated dataset has been used to train the algorithm, which provides accurate real-time identification of infected chicken and prompt warnings to farm operators for prompt action. By facilitating early infection identification, eliminating the need for human inspection, and enhancing biosecurity in large-scale farms, this AI technology improves chicken health management. The real-time features of YOLO v8 provide a scalable and effective method for improving farm management techniques.

<title>PixCuboid: Room Layout Estimation from Multi-view Featuremetric Alignment</title>

Abstract: Coarse room layout estimation provides important geometric cues for many downstream tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on single views and often assume panoramic images. We introduce PixCuboid, an optimization-based approach for cuboid-shaped room layout estimation, which is based on multi-view alignment of dense deep features. By training with the optimization end-to-end, we learn feature maps that yield large convergence basins and smooth loss landscapes in the alignment. This allows us to initialize the room layout using simple heuristics.
  For the evaluation we propose two new benchmarks based on ScanNet++ and 2D-3D-Semantics, with manually verified ground truth 3D cuboids. In thorough experiments we validate our approach and significantly outperform the competition. Finally, while our network is trained with single cuboids, the flexibility of the optimization-based approach allow us to easily extend to multi-room estimation, e.g. larger apartments or offices. Code and model weights are available at https://github.com/ghanning/PixCuboid.

<title>HierarchicalPrune: Position-Aware Compression for Large-Scale Diffusion Models</title>

arXiv:2508.04663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation: DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements. HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction (e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model while significantly outperforming prior works.

<title>ANPrompt: Anti-noise Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04677</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.04677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as an efficient and effective technique for adapting vision-language models (VLMs) with low computational overhead. However, existing methods often overlook the vulnerability of prompt-tuned VLMs to weak semantic perturbations-such as subtle image or text noise-that degrade their generalization to unseen classes. To address this limitation, we propose ANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under such perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by fusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered to form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt tokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper layers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware visual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype (NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally, ANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by computing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard cross-entropy and sim loss. Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate that ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning approaches, achieving superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization to novel categories.

Abstract: Learning action models from real-world human-centric interaction datasets is important towards building general-purpose intelligent assistants with efficiency. However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction category and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts. Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis. We believe that our InterVLA testbed and the benchmarks will foster future works on building AI agents in the physical world.

Abstract: End-to-end training of multi-agent systems offers significant advantages in improving multi-task performance. However, training such models remains challenging and requires extensive manual design and monitoring. In this work, we introduce TurboTrain, a novel and efficient training framework for multi-agent perception and prediction. TurboTrain comprises two key components: a multi-agent spatiotemporal pretraining scheme based on masked reconstruction learning and a balanced multi-task learning strategy based on gradient conflict suppression. By streamlining the training process, our framework eliminates the need for manually designing and tuning complex multi-stage training pipelines, substantially reducing training time and improving performance. We evaluate TurboTrain on a real-world cooperative driving dataset, V2XPnP-Seq, and demonstrate that it further improves the performance of state-of-the-art multi-agent perception and prediction models. Our results highlight that pretraining effectively captures spatiotemporal multi-agent features and significantly benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, the proposed balanced multi-task learning strategy enhances detection and prediction.

<title>BEVCon: Advancing Bird's Eye View Perception with Contrastive Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.04702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present BEVCon, a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework designed to improve Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception in autonomous driving. BEV perception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding environment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and trajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on enhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored potential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two contrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining BEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image backbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses leads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the backbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon achieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of representation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to conventional task-specific optimizations.

Abstract: 3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous driving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However, it remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across multiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and dynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level occupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the spatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core designs: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical information and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and a memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the spatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our method significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D occupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between multi-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal inconsistency by 29%.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have gained widespread adoption across various applications. Despite the success, the potential misuse of T2I models poses significant risks of generating Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. To investigate the vulnerability of T2I models, this paper delves into adversarial attacks to bypass the safety mechanisms under black-box settings. Most previous methods rely on word substitution to search adversarial prompts. Due to limited search space, this leads to suboptimal performance compared to gradient-based training. However, black-box settings present unique challenges to training gradient-driven attack methods, since there is no access to the internal architecture and parameters of T2I models. To facilitate the learning of adversarial prompts in black-box settings, we propose a novel prompt learning attack framework (PLA), where insightful gradient-based training tailored to black-box T2I models is designed by utilizing multimodal similarities. Experiments show that our new method can effectively attack the safety mechanisms of black-box T2I models including prompt filters and post-hoc safety checkers with a high success rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. Warning: This paper may contain offensive model-generated content.

Abstract: Accounting for individual differences can improve the effectiveness of visualization design. While the role of visual attention in visualization interpretation is well recognized, existing work often overlooks how this behavior varies based on visual literacy levels. Based on data from a 235-participant user study covering three visualization tests (mini-VLAT, CALVI, and SGL), we show that distinct attention patterns in visual data exploration can correlate with participants' literacy levels: While experts (high-scorers) generally show a strong attentional focus, novices (low-scorers) focus less and explore more. We then propose two computational models leveraging these insights: Lit2Sal -- a novel visual saliency model that predicts observer attention given their visualization literacy level, and Sal2Lit -- a model to predict visual literacy from human visual attention data. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluation demonstrates that Lit2Sal outperforms state-of-the-art saliency models with literacy-aware considerations. Sal2Lit predicts literacy with 86% accuracy using a single attention map, providing a time-efficient supplement to literacy assessment that only takes less than a minute. Taken together, our unique approach to consider individual differences in salience models and visual attention in literacy assessments paves the way for new directions in personalized visual data communication to enhance understanding.

arXiv:2508.03723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this report a framework for the collection of clinical images and data for use when training and validating artificial intelligence (AI) tools is described. The report contains not only information about the collection of the images and clinical data, but the ethics and information governance processes to consider ensuring the data is collected safely, and the infrastructure and agreements required to allow for the sharing of data with other groups.
  A key characteristic of the main collection framework described here is that it can enable automated and ongoing collection of datasets to ensure that the data is up-to-date and representative of current practice. This is important in the context of training and validating AI tools as it is vital that datasets have a mix of older cases with long term follow-up such that the clinical outcome is as accurate as possible, and current data. Validations run on old data will provide findings and conclusions relative to the status of the imaging units when that data was generated. It is important that a validation dataset can assess the AI tools with data that it would see if deployed and active now.
  Other types of collection frameworks, which do not follow a fully automated approach, are also described. Whilst the fully automated method is recommended for large scale, long-term image collection, there may be reasons to start data collection using semi-automated methods and indications of how to do that are provided.

<title>CX-Mind: A Pioneering Multimodal Large Language Model for Interleaved Reasoning in Chest X-ray via Curriculum-Guided Reinforcement Learning</title>

arXiv:2508.03733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic modalities in clinical practice, encompassing a broad spectrum of diagnostic tasks. Recent advancements have seen the extensive application of reasoning-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in medical imaging to enhance diagnostic efficiency and interpretability. However, existing multimodal models predominantly rely on "one-time" diagnostic approaches, lacking verifiable supervision of the reasoning process. This leads to challenges in multi-task CXR diagnosis, including lengthy reasoning, sparse rewards, and frequent hallucinations. To address these issues, we propose CX-Mind, the first generative model to achieve interleaved "think-answer" reasoning for CXR tasks, driven by curriculum-based reinforcement learning and verifiable process rewards (CuRL-VPR). Specifically, we constructed an instruction-tuning dataset, CX-Set, comprising 708,473 images and 2,619,148 samples, and generated 42,828 high-quality interleaved reasoning data points supervised by clinical reports. Optimization was conducted in two stages under the Group Relative Policy Optimization framework: initially stabilizing basic reasoning with closed-domain tasks, followed by transfer to open-domain diagnostics, incorporating rule-based conditional process rewards to bypass the need for pretrained reward models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CX-Mind significantly outperforms existing medical and general-domain MLLMs in visual understanding, text generation, and spatiotemporal alignment, achieving an average performance improvement of 25.1% over comparable CXR-specific models. On real-world clinical dataset (Rui-CXR), CX-Mind achieves a mean recall@1 across 14 diseases that substantially surpasses the second-best results, with multi-center expert evaluations further confirming its clinical utility across multiple dimensions.

Abstract: Visual impairment represents a major global health challenge, with multimodal imaging providing complementary information that is essential for accurate ophthalmic diagnosis. This comprehensive survey systematically reviews the latest advances in multimodal deep learning methods in ophthalmology up to the year 2025. The review focuses on two main categories: task-specific multimodal approaches and large-scale multimodal foundation models. Task-specific approaches are designed for particular clinical applications such as lesion detection, disease diagnosis, and image synthesis. These methods utilize a variety of imaging modalities including color fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, and angiography. On the other hand, foundation models combine sophisticated vision-language architectures and large language models pretrained on diverse ophthalmic datasets. These models enable robust cross-modal understanding, automated clinical report generation, and decision support. The survey critically examines important datasets, evaluation metrics, and methodological innovations including self-supervised learning, attention-based fusion, and contrastive alignment. It also discusses ongoing challenges such as variability in data, limited annotations, lack of interpretability, and issues with generalizability across different patient populations. Finally, the survey outlines promising future directions that emphasize the use of ultra-widefield imaging and reinforcement learning-based reasoning frameworks to create intelligent, interpretable, and clinically applicable AI systems for ophthalmology.

Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation plays a vital role in analyzing fundus images for the diagnosis of systemic and ocular diseases. Building on this, classifying segmented vessels into arteries and veins (A/V) further enables the extraction of clinically relevant features such as vessel width, diameter and tortuosity, which are essential for detecting conditions like diabetic and hypertensive retinopathy. However, manual segmentation and classification are time-consuming, costly and inconsistent. With the advancement of Convolutional Neural Networks, several automated methods have been proposed to address this challenge, but there are still some issues. For example, the existing methods all treat artery, vein and overall vessel segmentation as three separate binary tasks, neglecting the intrinsic coupling relationships between these anatomical structures. Considering artery and vein structures are subsets of the overall retinal vessel map and should naturally exhibit prediction consistency with it, we design a novel loss named Channel-Coupled Vessel Consistency Loss to enforce the coherence and consistency between vessel, artery and vein predictions, avoiding biasing the network toward three simple binary segmentation tasks. Moreover, we also introduce a regularization term named intra-image pixel-level contrastive loss to extract more discriminative feature-level fine-grained representations for accurate retinal A/V classification. SOTA results have been achieved across three public A/V classification datasets including RITE, LES-AV and HRF. Our code will be available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of the bone fracture is paramount to initiating treatment as early as possible and avoiding any delay in patient treatment and outcomes. Interpretation of X-ray image is a time consuming and error prone task, especially when resources for such interpretation are limited by lack of radiology expertise. Additionally, deep learning approaches used currently, typically suffer from misclassifications and lack interpretable explanations to clinical use. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose an automated framework of bone fracture detection using a VGG-19 model modified to our needs. It incorporates sophisticated preprocessing techniques that include Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), Otsu's thresholding, and Canny edge detection, among others, to enhance image clarity as well as to facilitate the feature extraction. Therefore, we use Grad-CAM, an Explainable AI method that can generate visual heatmaps of the model's decision making process, as a type of model interpretability, for clinicians to understand the model's decision making process. It encourages trust and helps in further clinical validation. It is deployed in a real time web application, where healthcare professionals can upload X-ray images and get the diagnostic feedback within 0.5 seconds. The performance of our modified VGG-19 model attains 99.78\% classification accuracy and AUC score of 1.00, making it exceptionally good. The framework provides a reliable, fast, and interpretable solution for bone fracture detection that reasons more efficiently for diagnoses and better patient care.

<title>Boosting Vision Semantic Density with Anatomy Normality Modeling for Medical Vision-language Pre-training</title>

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training (VLP) has great potential for developing multifunctional and general medical diagnostic capabilities. However, aligning medical images with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to reports with a high SNR presents a semantic density gap, leading to visual alignment bias. In this paper, we propose boosting vision semantic density to improve alignment effectiveness. On one hand, we enhance visual semantics through disease-level vision contrastive learning, which strengthens the model's ability to differentiate between normal and abnormal samples for each anatomical structure. On the other hand, we introduce an anatomical normality modeling method to model the distribution of normal samples for each anatomy, leveraging VQ-VAE for reconstructing normal vision embeddings in the latent space. This process amplifies abnormal signals by leveraging distribution shifts in abnormal samples, enhancing the model's perception and discrimination of abnormal attributes. The enhanced visual representation effectively captures the diagnostic-relevant semantics, facilitating more efficient and accurate alignment with the diagnostic report. We conduct extensive experiments on two chest CT datasets, CT-RATE and Rad-ChestCT, and an abdominal CT dataset, MedVL-CT69K, and comprehensively evaluate the diagnosis performance across multiple tasks in the chest and abdominal CT scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance. Notably, our method achieved an average AUC of 84.9% across 54 diseases in 15 organs, significantly surpassing existing methods. Additionally, we demonstrate the superior transfer learning capabilities of our pre-trained model. Code is available at https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/ViSD-Boost.

Abstract: Estimating the elasticity of soft tissue can provide useful information for various diagnostic applications. Ultrasound shear wave elastography offers a non-invasive approach. However, its generalizability and standardization across different systems and processing pipelines remain limited. Considering the influence of image processing on ultrasound based diagnostics, recent literature has discussed the impact of different image processing steps on reliable and reproducible elasticity analysis. In this work, we investigate the need of ultrasound pre-processing steps for deep learning-based ultrasound shear wave elastography. We evaluate the performance of a 3D convolutional neural network in predicting shear wave velocities from spatio-temporal ultrasound images, studying different degrees of pre-processing on the input images, ranging from fully beamformed and filtered ultrasound images to raw radiofrequency data. We compare the predictions from our deep learning approach to a conventional time-of-flight method across four gelatin phantoms with different elasticity levels. Our results demonstrate statistically significant differences in the predicted shear wave velocity among all elasticity groups, regardless of the degree of pre-processing. Although pre-processing slightly improves performance metrics, our results show that the deep learning approach can reliably differentiate between elasticity groups using raw, unprocessed radiofrequency data. These results show that deep learning-based approaches could reduce the need for and the bias of traditional ultrasound pre-processing steps in ultrasound shear wave elastography, enabling faster and more reliable clinical elasticity assessments.

Abstract: Early and accurate detection of glaucoma is critical to prevent irreversible vision loss. However, existing methods often rely on unimodal data and lack interpretability, limiting their clinical utility. In this paper, we present GlaBoost, a multimodal gradient boosting framework that integrates structured clinical features, fundus image embeddings, and expert-curated textual descriptions for glaucoma risk prediction. GlaBoost extracts high-level visual representations from retinal fundus photographs using a pretrained convolutional encoder and encodes free-text neuroretinal rim assessments using a transformer-based language model. These heterogeneous signals, combined with manually assessed risk scores and quantitative ophthalmic indicators, are fused into a unified feature space for classification via an enhanced XGBoost model. Experiments conducted on a real-world annotated dataset demonstrate that GlaBoost significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving a validation accuracy of 98.71%. Feature importance analysis reveals clinically consistent patterns, with cup-to-disc ratio, rim pallor, and specific textual embeddings contributing most to model decisions. GlaBoost offers a transparent and scalable solution for interpretable glaucoma diagnosis and can be extended to other ophthalmic disorders.

Abstract: Data augmentation methods inspired by CutMix have demonstrated significant potential in recent semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks. However, these approaches often apply CutMix operations in a rigid and inflexible manner, while paying insufficient attention to feature-level consistency constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Mutual Mask Mix with High-Low level feature consistency (M$^3$HL) to address the aforementioned challenges, which consists of two key components: 1) M$^3$: An enhanced data augmentation operation inspired by the masking strategy from Masked Image Modeling (MIM), which advances conventional CutMix through dynamically adjustable masks to generate spatially complementary image pairs for collaborative training, thereby enabling effective information fusion between labeled and unlabeled images. 2) HL: A hierarchical consistency regularization framework that enforces high-level and low-level feature consistency between unlabeled and mixed images, enabling the model to better capture discriminative feature representations.Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely adopted medical image segmentation benchmarks including the ACDC and LA datasets.

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised classification method using a limited number of coded acquisitions from a DD-CASSI hyperspectral imager. Based on a simple model of intra-class spectral variability, this approach allow to identify classes and estimate reference spectra, despite data compression by a factor of ten. Here, we highlight the limitations of the ground truths commonly used to evaluate this type of method: lack of a clear definition of the notion of class, high intra-class variability, and even classification errors. Using the Pavia University scene, we show that with simple assumptions, it is possible to detect regions that are spectrally more coherent, highlighting the need to rethink the evaluation of classification methods, particularly in unsupervised scenarios.

<title>LRTuckerRep: Low-rank Tucker Representation Model for Multi-dimensional Data Completion</title>

Abstract: Multi-dimensional data completion is a critical problem in computational sciences, particularly in domains such as computer vision, signal processing, and scientific computing. Existing methods typically leverage either global low-rank approximations or local smoothness regularization, but each suffers from notable limitations: low-rank methods are computationally expensive and may disrupt intrinsic data structures, while smoothness-based approaches often require extensive manual parameter tuning and exhibit poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel Low-Rank Tucker Representation (LRTuckerRep) model that unifies global and local prior modeling within a Tucker decomposition. Specifically, LRTuckerRep encodes low rankness through a self-adaptive weighted nuclear norm on the factor matrices and a sparse Tucker core, while capturing smoothness via a parameter-free Laplacian-based regularization on the factor spaces. To efficiently solve the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, we develop two iterative algorithms with provable convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional image inpainting and traffic data imputation demonstrate that LRTuckerRep achieves superior completion accuracy and robustness under high missing rates compared to baselines.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis, therapeutic planning, and longitudinal wound monitoring. However, this task remains challenging due to the heterogeneous appearance, irregular morphology, and complex backgrounds associated with ulcer regions in clinical photographs. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as U-Net, provide strong localization capabilities but struggle to model long-range spatial dependencies due to their inherently limited receptive fields. To address this, we propose FUTransUNet, a hybrid architecture that integrates the global attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViTs) into the U-Net framework. This combination allows the model to extract global contextual features while maintaining fine-grained spatial resolution through skip connections and an effective decoding pathway. We trained and validated FUTransUNet on the public Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (FUSeg) dataset. FUTransUNet achieved a training Dice Coefficient of 0.8679, an IoU of 0.7672, and a training loss of 0.0053. On the validation set, the model achieved a Dice Coefficient of 0.8751, an IoU of 0.7780, and a validation loss of 0.009045. To ensure clinical transparency, we employed Grad-CAM visualizations, which highlighted model focus areas during prediction. These quantitative outcomes clearly demonstrate that our hybrid approach successfully integrates global and local feature extraction paradigms, thereby offering a highly robust, accurate, explainable, and interpretable solution and clinically translatable solution for automated foot ulcer analysis. The approach offers a reliable, high-fidelity solution for DFU segmentation, with implications for improving real-world wound assessment and patient care.

<title>Assessing the Impact of Image Super Resolution on White Blood Cell Classification Accuracy</title>

Abstract: Accurately classifying white blood cells from microscopic images is essential to identify several illnesses and conditions in medical diagnostics. Many deep learning technologies are being employed to quickly and automatically classify images. However, most of the time, the resolution of these microscopic pictures is quite low, which might make it difficult to classify them correctly. Some picture improvement techniques, such as image super-resolution, are being utilized to improve the resolution of the photos to get around this issue. The suggested study uses large image dimension upscaling to investigate how picture-enhancing approaches affect classification performance. The study specifically looks at how deep learning models may be able to understand more complex visual information by capturing subtler morphological changes when image resolution is increased using cutting-edge techniques. The model may learn from standard and augmented data since the improved images are incorporated into the training process. This dual method seeks to comprehend the impact of image resolution on model performance and enhance classification accuracy. A well-known model for picture categorization is used to conduct extensive testing and thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. This research intends to create more efficient image identification algorithms customized to a particular dataset of white blood cells by understanding the trade-offs between ordinary and enhanced images.

Abstract: In this intercontinental, confirmatory study, we include a retrospective cohort of 22,481 MRI examinations (21,288 patients; 46 cities in 22 countries) to train and externally validate the PI-CAI-2B model, i.e., an efficient, next-generation iteration of the state-of-the-art AI system that was developed for detecting Gleason grade group $\geq$2 prostate cancer on MRI during the PI-CAI study. Of these examinations, 20,471 cases (19,278 patients; 26 cities in 14 countries) from two EU Horizon projects (ProCAncer-I, COMFORT) and 12 independent centers based in Europe, North America, Asia and Africa, are used for training and internal testing. Additionally, 2010 cases (2010 patients; 20 external cities in 12 countries) from population-based screening (STHLM3-MRI, IP1-PROSTAGRAM trials) and primary diagnostic settings (PRIME trial) based in Europe, North and South Americas, Asia and Australia, are used for external testing. Primary endpoint is the proportion of AI-based assessments in agreement with the standard of care diagnoses (i.e., clinical assessments made by expert uropathologists on histopathology, if available, or at least two expert urogenital radiologists in consensus; with access to patient history and peer consultation) in the detection of Gleason grade group $\geq$2 prostate cancer within the external testing cohorts. Our statistical analysis plan is prespecified with a hypothesis of diagnostic interchangeability to the standard of care at the PI-RADS $\geq$3 (primary diagnosis) or $\geq$4 (screening) cut-off, considering an absolute margin of 0.05 and reader estimates derived from the PI-CAI observer study (62 radiologists reading 400 cases). Secondary measures comprise the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the AI system stratified by imaging quality, patient age and patient ethnicity to identify underlying biases (if any).

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease detection requires expensive neuroimaging or invasive procedures, limiting accessibility. This study explores whether deep learning can enable non-invasive Alzheimer's disease detection through handwriting analysis. Using a dataset of 34 distinct handwriting tasks collected from healthy controls and Alzheimer's disease patients, we evaluate and compare three recurrent neural architectures (LSTM, GRU, RNN) against traditional machine learning models. A crucial distinction of our approach is that the recurrent models process pre-extracted features from discrete strokes, not raw temporal signals. This violates the assumption of a continuous temporal flow that recurrent networks are designed to capture. Results reveal that they exhibit poor specificity and high variance. Traditional ensemble methods significantly outperform all deep architectures, achieving higher accuracy with balanced metrics. This demonstrates that recurrent architectures, designed for continuous temporal sequences, fail when applied to feature vectors extracted from ambiguously segmented strokes. Despite their complexity, deep learning models cannot overcome the fundamental disconnect between their architectural assumptions and the discrete, feature-based nature of stroke-level handwriting data. Although performance is limited, the study highlights several critical issues in data representation and model compatibility, pointing to valuable directions for future research.

Abstract: This work aims to overcome an assumption of conventional MR simulators: Individual isochromats should be simulated individually. To reduce the computational times of MR simulation, a new simulation method using grouped isochromats is proposed. When multiple isochromats are grouped before simulations, some parts of the simulation can be shared in each group. For a certain gradient type, the isochromats in the group can be easily chosen for ensuring that they behave the same. For example, the group can be defined as the isochromats whose locations along x-axis, T1, T2 and magnetic field inhomogeneity values are the same values. In such groups, simulations can be combined when a pulse sequence with the magnetic field gradient along x-axis only are processed. The processing times of the conventional and proposed methods were evaluated with several sequences including fast spin echo (FSE) and echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences. The simulation times of the proposed method were 3 to 72 times faster than those of the conventional methods. In the cases of 27.5 million isochromats using single instruction multiple data (SIMD) instructions and multi-threading, the conventional method simulated FSE and EPI sequences in 208.4 and 66.4 seconds, respectively. In the same cases, the proposed method simulated these sequences in 38.1 and 7.1 seconds, respectively.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions using multicontrast magnetic resonance (MR) images improves efficiency and reproducibility compared to manual delineation, with deep learning (DL) methods achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, these DL-based methods have yet to simultaneously optimize in-domain accuracy and out-of-domain generalization when trained on a single source with limited data, or their performance has been unsatisfactory. To fill this gap, we propose a method called UNISELF, which achieves high accuracy within a single training domain while demonstrating strong generalizability across multiple out-of-domain test datasets. UNISELF employs a novel test-time self-ensembled lesion fusion to improve segmentation accuracy, and leverages test-time instance normalization (TTIN) of latent features to address domain shifts and missing input contrasts. Trained on the ISBI 2015 longitudinal MS segmentation challenge training dataset, UNISELF ranks among the best-performing methods on the challenge test dataset. Additionally, UNISELF outperforms all benchmark methods trained on the same ISBI training data across diverse out-of-domain test datasets with domain shifts and missing contrasts, including the public MICCAI 2016 and UMCL datasets, as well as a private multisite dataset. These test datasets exhibit domain shifts and/or missing contrasts caused by variations in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and imaging artifacts arising from imperfect acquisition.

Abstract: Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR), with applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing methods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when new behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language models (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images, suffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose ZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly from raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise feature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every activity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence, and a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select features, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and natural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR without any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on 8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering clear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1. Ablation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as a promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis. Our codes are available at https://github.com/zechenli03/ZARA.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is a cornerstone of modern oncologic and neurologic imaging, distinguished by its unique ability to illuminate dynamic metabolic processes that transcend the anatomical focus of traditional imaging technologies. Radiology reports are essential for clinical decision making, yet their manual creation is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent advancements of vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential in medical applications, presenting a promising avenue for automating report generation. However, existing applications of VLMs in the medical domain have predominantly focused on structural imaging modalities, while the unique characteristics of molecular PET imaging have largely been overlooked. To bridge the gap, we introduce PET2Rep, a large-scale comprehensive benchmark for evaluation of general and medical VLMs for radiology report generation for PET images. PET2Rep stands out as the first dedicated dataset for PET report generation with metabolic information, uniquely capturing whole-body image-report pairs that cover dozens of organs to fill the critical gap in existing benchmarks and mirror real-world clinical comprehensiveness. In addition to widely recognized natural language generation metrics, we introduce a series of clinical efficiency metrics to evaluate the quality of radiotracer uptake pattern description in key organs in generated reports. We conduct a head-to-head comparison of 30 cutting-edge general-purpose and medical-specialized VLMs. The results show that the current state-of-the-art VLMs perform poorly on PET report generation task, falling considerably short of fulfilling practical needs. Moreover, we identify several key insufficiency that need to be addressed to advance the development in medical applications.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, yet most existing methods are limited by fixed-pattern or single-target triggers, making them inflexible and easier to detect. We propose FLAT (FL Arbitrary-Target Attack), a novel backdoor attack that leverages a latent-driven conditional autoencoder to generate diverse, target-specific triggers as needed. By introducing a latent code, FLAT enables the creation of visually adaptive and highly variable triggers, allowing attackers to select arbitrary targets without retraining and to evade conventional detection mechanisms. Our approach unifies attack success, stealth, and diversity within a single framework, introducing a new level of flexibility and sophistication to backdoor attacks in FL. Extensive experiments show that FLAT achieves high attack success and remains robust against advanced FL defenses. These results highlight the urgent need for new defense strategies to address latent-driven, multi-target backdoor threats in federated settings.

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a labor-intensive and expert-driven process, often resulting in inconsistent reconstructions and suboptimal results. We propose RLGS, a plug-and-play reinforcement learning framework for adaptive hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS through lightweight policy modules, dynamically adjusting critical hyperparameters such as learning rates and densification thresholds. The framework is model-agnostic and seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS pipelines without architectural modifications. We demonstrate its generalization ability across multiple state-of-the-art 3DGS variants, including Taming-3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC, and validate its robustness across diverse datasets. RLGS consistently enhances rendering quality. For example, it improves Taming-3DGS by 0.7dB PSNR on the Tanks and Temple (TNT) dataset, under a fixed Gaussian budget, and continues to yield gains even when baseline performance saturates. Our results suggest that RLGS provides an effective and general solution for automating hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS training, bridging a gap in applying reinforcement learning to 3DGS.

Abstract: The underspecification of progressive levels of difficulty in measurement constructs design and assessment tests for data visualization literacy may hinder the expressivity of measurements in both test design and test reuse. To mitigate this problem, this paper proposes DRIVE-T (Discriminating and Representative Items for Validating Expressive Tests), a methodology designed to drive the construction and evaluation of assessment items. Given a data vizualization, DRIVE-T supports the identification of task-based items discriminability and representativeness for measuring levels of data visualization literacy. DRIVE-T consists of three steps: (1) tagging task-based items associated with a set of data vizualizations; (2) rating them by independent raters for their difficulty; (3) analysing raters' raw scores through a Many-Facet Rasch Measurement model. In this way, we can observe the emergence of difficulty levels of the measurement construct, derived from the discriminability and representativeness of task-based items for each data vizualization, ordered into Many-Facets construct levels. In this study, we show and apply each step of the methodology to an item bank, which models the difficulty levels of a measurement construct approximating a latent construct for data visualization literacy. This measurement construct is drawn from semiotics, i.e., based on the syntax, semantics and pragmatics knowledge that each data visualization may require to be mastered by people. The DRIVE-T methodology operationalises an inductive approach, observable in a post-design phase of the items preparation, for formative-style and practice-based measurement construct emergence. A pilot study with items selected through the application of DRIVE-T is also presented to test our approach.

Abstract: The primate visual cortex exhibits topographic organization, where functionally similar neurons are spatially clustered, a structure widely believed to enhance neural processing efficiency. While prior works have demonstrated that conventional deep ANNs can develop topographic representations, these models largely neglect crucial temporal dynamics. This oversight often leads to significant performance degradation in tasks like object recognition and compromises their biological fidelity. To address this, we leverage spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently capture spike-based temporal dynamics and offer enhanced biological plausibility. We propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic deep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), successfully replicating the hierarchical spatial functional organization observed in the primate visual cortex from low-level sensory input to high-level abstract representations. Our results show that STC effectively generates representative topographic features across simulated visual cortical areas. While introducing topography typically leads to significant performance degradation in ANNs, our spiking architecture exhibits a remarkably small performance drop (No drop in ImageNet top-1 accuracy, compared to a 3\% drop observed in TopoNet, which is the best-performing topographic ANN so far) and outperforms topographic ANNs in brain-likeness. We also reveal that topographic organization facilitates efficient and stable temporal information processing via the spike mechanism in TDSNNs, contributing to model robustness. These findings suggest that TDSNNs offer a compelling balance between computational performance and brain-like features, providing not only a framework for interpreting neural science phenomena but also novel insights for designing more efficient and robust deep learning models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show significant potential in healthcare, prompting numerous benchmarks to evaluate their capabilities. However, concerns persist regarding the reliability of these benchmarks, which often lack clinical fidelity, robust data management, and safety-oriented evaluation metrics. To address these shortcomings, we introduce MedCheck, the first lifecycle-oriented assessment framework specifically designed for medical benchmarks. Our framework deconstructs a benchmark's development into five continuous stages, from design to governance, and provides a comprehensive checklist of 46 medically-tailored criteria. Using MedCheck, we conducted an in-depth empirical evaluation of 53 medical LLM benchmarks. Our analysis uncovers widespread, systemic issues, including a profound disconnect from clinical practice, a crisis of data integrity due to unmitigated contamination risks, and a systematic neglect of safety-critical evaluation dimensions like model robustness and uncertainty awareness. Based on these findings, MedCheck serves as both a diagnostic tool for existing benchmarks and an actionable guideline to foster a more standardized, reliable, and transparent approach to evaluating AI in healthcare.

Abstract: Reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs) have substantially advanced through methods such as chain-of-thought and explicit step-by-step explanations. However, these improvements have not yet fully transitioned to multimodal contexts, where models must proactively decide which sensory modalities such as vision, audio, or spatial perception to engage when interacting with complex real-world environments. In this paper, we introduce the Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach that encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted questions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the model to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical information necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We evaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by integrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our CoQ method improves a foundation model's ability to effectively identify and integrate pertinent sensory information. This leads to improved accuracy, interpretability, and alignment of the reasoning process with diverse multimodal tasks.

Abstract: The dynamic environment of laboratories and clinics, with streams of data arriving on a daily basis, requires regular updates of trained machine learning models for consistent performance. Continual learning is supposed to help train models without catastrophic forgetting. However, state-of-the-art methods are ineffective for multiple instance learning (MIL), which is often used in single-cell-based hematologic disease diagnosis (e.g., leukemia detection). Here, we propose the first continual learning method tailored specifically to MIL. Our method is rehearsal-based over a selection of single instances from various bags. We use a combination of the instance attention score and distance from the bag mean and class mean vectors to carefully select which samples and instances to store in exemplary sets from previous tasks, preserving the diversity of the data. Using the real-world input of one month of data from a leukemia laboratory, we study the effectiveness of our approach in a class incremental scenario, comparing it to well-known continual learning methods. We show that our method considerably outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing the first continual learning approach for MIL. This enables the adaptation of models to shifting data distributions over time, such as those caused by changes in disease occurrence or underlying genetic alterations.

Abstract: Masked autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful approach for pre-training on unlabelled data, capable of learning robust and informative feature representations. This is particularly advantageous in diffused lung disease research, where annotated imaging datasets are scarce. To leverage this, we train an MAE on a curated collection of over 5,000 chest computed tomography (CT) scans, combining in-house data with publicly available scans from related conditions that exhibit similar radiological patterns, such as COVID-19 and bacterial pneumonia. The pretrained MAE is then fine-tuned on a downstream classification task for diffused lung disease diagnosis. Our findings demonstrate that MAEs can effectively extract clinically meaningful features and improve diagnostic performance, even in the absence of large-scale labelled datasets. The code and the models are available here: https://github.com/eedack01/lung_masked_autoencoder.

Abstract: Image registration is a fundamental technique in the analysis of longitudinal and multi-phase CT images within clinical practice. However, most existing methods are tailored for single-organ applications, limiting their generalizability to other anatomical regions. This work presents TotalRegistrator, an image registration framework capable of aligning multiple anatomical regions simultaneously using a standard UNet architecture and a novel field decomposition strategy. The model is lightweight, requiring only 11GB of GPU memory for training. To train and evaluate our method, we constructed a large-scale longitudinal dataset comprising 695 whole-body (thorax-abdomen-pelvic) paired CT scans from individual patients acquired at different time points. We benchmarked TotalRegistrator against a generic classical iterative algorithm and a recent foundation model for image registration. To further assess robustness and generalizability, we evaluated our model on three external datasets: the public thoracic and abdominal datasets from the Learn2Reg challenge, and a private multiphase abdominal dataset from a collaborating hospital. Experimental results on the in-house dataset show that the proposed approach generally surpasses baseline methods in multi-organ abdominal registration, with a slight drop in lung alignment performance. On out-of-distribution datasets, it achieved competitive results compared to leading single-organ models, despite not being fine-tuned for those tasks, demonstrating strong generalizability. The source code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/oncology_image_registration.git.

Abstract: The dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations. With the evolution of (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to reality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and mobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g., Graphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate tasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine methodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse tasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions for future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and self-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents research, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial development. An open-source GitHub repository is maintained as a dynamic resource to foster further innovation in this field. We present a 9-page version of our work, accepted by ACL 2025, to provide a concise overview to the domain.

Abstract: We present OpenDCVCs, an open-source PyTorch implementation designed to advance reproducible research in learned video compression. OpenDCVCs provides unified and training-ready implementations of four representative Deep Contextual Video Compression (DCVC) models--DCVC, DCVC with Temporal Context Modeling (DCVC-TCM), DCVC with Hybrid Entropy Modeling (DCVC-HEM), and DCVC with Diverse Contexts (DCVC-DC). While the DCVC series achieves substantial bitrate reductions over both classical codecs and advanced learned models, previous public code releases have been limited to evaluation codes, presenting significant barriers to reproducibility, benchmarking, and further development. OpenDCVCs bridges this gap by offering a comprehensive, self-contained framework that supports both end-to-end training and evaluation for all included algorithms. The implementation includes detailed documentation, evaluation protocols, and extensive benchmarking results across diverse datasets, providing a transparent and consistent foundation for comparison and extension.

Abstract: Current multi-view 3D reconstruction methods rely on accurate camera calibration and pose estimation, requiring complex and time-intensive pre-processing that hinders their practical deployment. To address this challenge, we introduce Surf3R, an end-to-end feedforward approach that reconstructs 3D surfaces from sparse views without estimating camera poses and completes an entire scene in under 10 seconds. Our method employs a multi-branch and multi-view decoding architecture in which multiple reference views jointly guide the reconstruction process. Through the proposed branch-wise processing, cross-view attention, and inter-branch fusion, the model effectively captures complementary geometric cues without requiring camera calibration. Moreover, we introduce a D-Normal regularizer based on an explicit 3D Gaussian representation for surface reconstruction. It couples surface normals with other geometric parameters to jointly optimize the 3D geometry, significantly improving 3D consistency and surface detail accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Surf3R achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple surface reconstruction metrics on ScanNet++ and Replica datasets, exhibiting excellent generalization and efficiency.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the fetal brain has become a key tool for studying brain development in vivo. Yet, its assessment remains challenging due to variability in brain maturation, imaging protocols, and uncertain estimates of Gestational Age (GA). To overcome these, brain atlases provide a standardized reference framework that facilitates objective evaluation and comparison across subjects by aligning the atlas and subjects in a common coordinate system. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning framework for generating continuous, age-specific fetal brain atlases for real-time fetal brain tissue segmentation. The framework combines a direct registration model with a conditional discriminator. Trained on a curated dataset of 219 neurotypical fetal MRIs spanning from 21 to 37 weeks of gestation. The method achieves high registration accuracy, captures dynamic anatomical changes with sharp structural detail, and robust segmentation performance with an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 86.3% across six brain tissues. Furthermore, volumetric analysis of the generated atlases reveals detailed neurotypical growth trajectories, providing valuable insights into the maturation of the fetal brain. This approach enables individualized developmental assessment with minimal pre-processing and real-time performance, supporting both research and clinical applications.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents the most prevalent type of cardiac arrhythmia for which treatment may require patients to undergo ablation therapy. In this surgery cardiac tissues are locally scarred on purpose to prevent electrical signals from causing arrhythmia. Patient-specific cardiac digital twin models show great potential for personalized ablation therapy, however, they demand accurate semantic segmentation of healthy and scarred tissue typically obtained from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) magnetic resonance (MR) scans. In this work we propose the Left Atrial Cascading Refinement CNN (LA-CaRe-CNN), which aims to accurately segment the left atrium as well as left atrial scar tissue from LGE MR scans. LA-CaRe-CNN is a 2-stage CNN cascade that is trained end-to-end in 3D, where Stage 1 generates a prediction for the left atrium, which is then refined in Stage 2 in conjunction with the original image information to obtain a prediction for the left atrial scar tissue. To account for domain shift towards domains unknown during training, we employ strong intensity and spatial augmentation to increase the diversity of the training dataset. Our proposed method based on a 5-fold ensemble achieves great segmentation results, namely, 89.21% DSC and 1.6969 mm ASSD for the left atrium, as well as 64.59% DSC and 91.80% G-DSC for the more challenging left atrial scar tissue. Thus, segmentations obtained through LA-CaRe-CNN show great potential for the generation of patient-specific cardiac digital twin models and downstream tasks like personalized targeted ablation therapy to treat AF.

Abstract: Telecommunications and computer vision have evolved independently. With the emergence of high-frequency wireless links operating mostly in line-of-sight, visual data can help predict the channel dynamics by detecting obstacles and help overcoming them through beamforming or handover techniques.
  This paper proposes a novel architecture for delivering real-time radio and video sensing information to O-RAN xApps through a multi-agent approach, and introduces a new video function capable of generating blockage information for xApps, enabling Integrated Sensing and Communications. Experimental results show that the delay of sensing information remains under 1\,ms and that an xApp can successfully use radio and video sensing information to control the 5G/6G RAN in real-time.

Abstract: Collecting real-world data for rare high-risk scenarios, long-tailed driving events, and complex interactions remains challenging, leading to poor performance of existing autonomous driving systems in these critical situations. In this paper, we propose RoboTron-Sim that improves real-world driving in critical situations by utilizing simulated hard cases. First, we develop a simulated dataset called Hard-case Augmented Synthetic Scenarios (HASS), which covers 13 high-risk edge-case categories, as well as balanced environmental conditions such as day/night and sunny/rainy. Second, we introduce Scenario-aware Prompt Engineering (SPE) and an Image-to-Ego Encoder (I2E Encoder) to enable multimodal large language models to effectively learn real-world challenging driving skills from HASS, via adapting to environmental deviations and hardware differences between real-world and simulated scenarios. Extensive experiments on nuScenes show that RoboTron-Sim improves driving performance in challenging scenarios by around 50%, achieving state-of-the-art results in real-world open-loop planning. Qualitative results further demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboTron-Sim in better managing rare high-risk driving scenarios. Project page: https://stars79689.github.io/RoboTron-Sim/

Abstract: Astronomical telescopes suffer from a tradeoff between field of view (FoV) and image resolution: increasing the FoV leads to an optical field that is under-sampled by the science camera. This work presents a novel computational imaging approach to overcome this tradeoff by leveraging the existing adaptive optics (AO) systems in modern ground-based telescopes. Our key idea is to use the AO system's deformable mirror to apply a series of learned, precisely controlled distortions to the optical wavefront, producing a sequence of images that exhibit distinct, high-frequency, sub-pixel shifts. These images can then be jointly upsampled to yield the final super-resolved image. Crucially, we show this can be done while simultaneously maintaining the core AO operation--correcting for the unknown and rapidly changing wavefront distortions caused by Earth's atmosphere. To achieve this, we incorporate end-to-end optimization of both the induced mirror distortions and the upsampling algorithm, such that telescope-specific optics and temporal statistics of atmospheric wavefront distortions are accounted for. Our experimental results with a hardware prototype, as well as simulations, demonstrate significant SNR improvements of up to 12 dB over non-AO super-resolution baselines, using only existing telescope optics and no hardware modifications. Moreover, by using a precise bench-top replica of a complete telescope and AO system, we show that our methodology can be readily transferred to an operational telescope.

Abstract: Our purpose is to improve performance-based animation which can drive believable 3D stylized characters that are truly perceptual. By combining traditional blendshape animation techniques with multiple machine learning models, we present both non-real time and real time solutions which drive character expressions in a geometrically consistent and perceptually valid way. For the non-real time system, we propose a 3D emotion transfer network makes use of a 2D human image to generate a stylized 3D rig parameters. For the real time system, we propose a blendshape adaption network which generates the character rig parameter motions with geometric consistency and temporally stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by comparing to a commercial product Faceware. Results reveal that ratings of the recognition, intensity, and attractiveness of expressions depicted for animated characters via our systems are statistically higher than Faceware. Our results may be implemented into the animation pipeline, and provide animators with a system for creating the expressions they wish to use more quickly and accurately.

Abstract: Repurposing large vision-language models (LVLMs) as computer use agents (CUAs) has led to substantial breakthroughs, primarily driven by human-labeled data. However, these models often struggle with novel and specialized software, particularly in scenarios lacking human annotations. To address this challenge, we propose SEAgent, an agentic self-evolving framework enabling CUAs to autonomously evolve through interactions with unfamiliar software. Specifically, SEAgent empowers computer-use agents to autonomously master novel software environments via experiential learning, where agents explore new software, learn through iterative trial-and-error, and progressively tackle auto-generated tasks organized from simple to complex. To achieve this goal, we design a World State Model for step-wise trajectory assessment, along with a Curriculum Generator that generates increasingly diverse and challenging tasks. The agent's policy is updated through experiential learning, comprised of adversarial imitation of failure actions and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on successful ones. Furthermore, we introduce a specialist-to-generalist training strategy that integrates individual experiential insights from specialist agents, facilitating the development of a stronger generalist CUA capable of continuous autonomous evolution. This unified agent ultimately achieves performance surpassing ensembles of individual specialist agents on their specialized software. We validate the effectiveness of SEAgent across five novel software environments within OS-World. Our approach achieves a significant improvement of 23.2% in success rate, from 11.3% to 34.5%, over a competitive open-source CUA, i.e., UI-TARS.

Abstract: Human-centric perception tasks, e.g., pedestrian detection, skeleton-based action recognition, and pose estimation, have wide industrial applications, such as metaverse and sports analysis. There is a recent surge to develop human-centric foundation models that can benefit a broad range of human-centric perception tasks. While many human-centric foundation models have achieved success, they did not explore 3D and vision-language tasks for human-centric and required task-specific finetuning. These limitations restrict their application to more downstream tasks and situations. To tackle these problems, we present Hulk, the first multimodal human-centric generalist model, capable of addressing 2D vision, 3D vision, skeleton-based, and vision-language tasks without task-specific finetuning. The key to achieving this is condensing various task-specific heads into two general heads, one for discrete representations, \emph{e.g.,} languages, and the other for continuous representations, \emph{e.g.,} location coordinates. The outputs of two heads can be further stacked into four distinct input and output modalities. This uniform representation enables Hulk to treat diverse human-centric tasks as modality translation, integrating knowledge across a wide range of tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of Hulk on 12 benchmarks covering 8 human-centric tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 11 benchmarks. The code will be available on https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Hulk.

Abstract: Existing event stream based trackers undergo evaluation on short-term tracking datasets, however, the tracking of real-world scenarios involves long-term tracking, and the performance of existing tracking algorithms in these scenarios remains unclear. In this paper, we first propose a new long-term, large-scale frame-event visual object tracking dataset, termed FELT. It contains 1,044 long-term videos that involve 1.9 million RGB frames and event stream pairs, 60 different target objects, and 14 challenging attributes. To build a solid benchmark, we retrain and evaluate 21 baseline trackers on our dataset for future work to compare. In addition, we propose a novel Associative Memory Transformer based RGB-Event long-term visual tracker, termed AMTTrack. It follows a one-stream tracking framework and aggregates the multi-scale RGB/event template and search tokens effectively via the Hopfield retrieval layer. The framework also embodies another aspect of associative memory by maintaining dynamic template representations through an associative memory update scheme, which addresses the appearance variation in long-term tracking. Extensive experiments on FELT, FE108, VisEvent, and COESOT datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed tracker. Both the dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/FELT_SOT_Benchmark

Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) radar is a non-intrusive privacy and relatively convenient and inexpensive device, which has been demonstrated to be applicable in place of RGB cameras in human indoor pose estimation tasks. However, mmWave radar relies on the collection of reflected signals from the target, and the radar signals containing information is difficult to be fully applied. This has been a long-standing hindrance to the improvement of pose estimation accuracy. To address this major challenge, this paper introduces a probability map guided multi-format feature fusion model, ProbRadarM3F. This is a novel radar feature extraction framework using a traditional FFT method in parallel with a probability map based positional encoding method. ProbRadarM3F fuses the traditional heatmap features and the positional features, then effectively achieves the estimation of 14 keypoints of the human body. Experimental evaluation on the HuPR dataset proves the effectiveness of the model proposed in this paper, outperforming other methods experimented on this dataset with an AP of 69.9 %. The emphasis of our study is focusing on the position information that is not exploited before in radar singal. This provides direction to investigate other potential non-redundant information from mmWave rader.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding (OV-3D) aims to localize and classify novel objects beyond the closed set of object classes. However, existing approaches and benchmarks primarily focus on the open vocabulary problem within the context of object classes, which is insufficient in providing a holistic evaluation to what extent a model understands the 3D scene. In this paper, we introduce a more challenging task called Generalized Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding (GOV-3D) to explore the open vocabulary problem beyond object classes. It encompasses an open and diverse set of generalized knowledge, expressed as linguistic queries of fine-grained and object-specific attributes. To this end, we contribute a new benchmark named \textit{OpenScan}, which consists of 3D object attributes across eight representative linguistic aspects, including affordance, property, and material. We further evaluate state-of-the-art OV-3D methods on our OpenScan benchmark and discover that these methods struggle to comprehend the abstract vocabularies of the GOV-3D task, a challenge that cannot be addressed simply by scaling up object classes during training. We highlight the limitations of existing methodologies and explore promising directions to overcome the identified shortcomings.

Abstract: Active learning enhances annotation efficiency by selecting the most revealing samples for labeling, thereby reducing reliance on extensive human input. Previous methods in semantic segmentation have centered on individual pixels or small areas, neglecting the rich patterns in natural images and the power of advanced pre-trained models. To address these challenges, we propose three key contributions: Firstly, we introduce Entity-Superpixel Annotation (ESA), an innovative and efficient active learning strategy which utilizes a class-agnostic mask proposal network coupled with super-pixel grouping to capture local structural cues. Additionally, our method selects a subset of entities within each image of the target domain, prioritizing superpixels with high entropy to ensure comprehensive representation. Simultaneously, it focuses on a limited number of key entities, thereby optimizing for efficiency. By utilizing an annotator-friendly design that capitalizes on the inherent structure of images, our approach significantly outperforms existing pixel-based methods, achieving superior results with minimal queries, specifically reducing click cost by 98% and enhancing performance by 1.71%. For instance, our technique requires a mere 40 clicks for annotation, a stark contrast to the 5000 clicks demanded by conventional methods.

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technologies, AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) have been widely applied in various aspects of daily life. However, due to the immaturity of the technology, the quality of the generated images varies, so it is important to develop quality assessment techniques for the generated images. Although some models have been proposed to assess the quality of generated images, they are inadequate when faced with the ever-increasing and diverse categories of generated images. Consequently, the development of more advanced and effective models for evaluating the quality of generated images is urgently needed. Recent research has explored the significant potential of the visual language model CLIP in image quality assessment, finding that it performs well in evaluating the quality of natural images. However, its application to generated images has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we build on this idea and further explore the potential of CLIP in evaluating the quality of generated images. We design CLIP-AGIQA, a CLIP-based regression model for quality assessment of generated images, leveraging rich visual and textual knowledge encapsulated in CLIP. Particularly, we implement multi-category learnable prompts to fully utilize the textual knowledge in CLIP for quality assessment. Extensive experiments on several generated image quality assessment benchmarks, including AGIQA-3K and AIGCIQA2023, demonstrate that CLIP-AGIQA outperforms existing IQA models, achieving excellent results in evaluating the quality of generated images.

Abstract: Recently, large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved significant advancements. When dealing with high-resolution images, dominant LMMs typically divide them into multiple local images and a global image, leading to a large number of visual tokens. In this work, we introduce AVG-LLaVA, an LMM that can adaptively select the appropriate visual granularity based on the input image and instruction. Specifically, we first apply the multiple pooling layers to obtain visual tokens at different granularities. Then we propose a visual granularity router, which includes a Transformer layer, an MLP layer, and a voter layer, used to select the appropriate visual granularity based on the image and instruction. Furthermore, we put forward RGLF, a novel training paradigm that aims at aligning the granularity predicted by the router with the preferences of the LMM, without the need for additional manually annotated data. Extensive experiments and analysis show that AVG-LLaVA achieves superior performance across 11 benchmarks, as well as significantly reduces the number of visual tokens and speeds up inference (e.g., an 85.3% reduction in visual tokens and a 2.53$\times$ increase in inference speed on the AI2D benchmark).

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) provide an immersive visual experience by capturing the 360{\deg} scene. With the rapid advancements in virtual/augmented reality, metaverse, and generative artificial intelligence, the demand for high-quality ODVs is surging. However, ODVs often suffer from low resolution due to their wide field of view and limitations in capturing devices and transmission bandwidth. Although video super-resolution (SR) is a capable video quality enhancement technique, the performance ceiling and practical generalization of existing methods are limited when applied to ODVs due to their unique attributes. To alleviate spatial projection distortions and temporal flickering of ODVs, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) with joint spatio-temporal alignment and reconstruction. Specifically, we incorporate a spatio-temporal continuous alignment (STCA) to mitigate discrete geometric artifacts in parallel with temporal alignment. Subsequently, we introduce an interlaced multi-frame reconstruction (IMFR) to enhance temporal consistency. Furthermore, we employ latitude-saliency adaptive (LSA) weights to focus on regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. By exploring a spatio-temporal jointly framework and real-world viewing strategies, STDAN effectively reinforces spatio-temporal coherence on a novel ODV-SR dataset and ensures affordable computational costs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that STDAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in improving visual fidelity and dynamic smoothness of ODVs.

Abstract: We present CapsoNet, a deep learning framework developed for the Capsule Vision 2024 Challenge, designed to perform multi-class abnormality classification in video capsule endoscopy (VCE) frames. CapsoNet leverages an ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based architectures to capture both local and global visual features. The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset of over 50,000 annotated frames spanning ten abnormality classes, sourced from three public and one private dataset. To address the challenge of class imbalance, we employed focal loss, weighted random sampling, and extensive data augmentation strategies. All models were fully fine-tuned to maximize performance within the ensemble. CapsoNet achieved a balanced accuracy of 86.34 percent and a mean AUC-ROC of 0.9908 on the official validation set, securing Team Seq2Cure 5th place in the competition. Our implementation is available at http://github.com/arnavs04/capsule-vision-2024

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed across applications. However, ensuring their reliability remains a challenge, and in many situations, alternative models with similar functionality and accuracy are available. Traditional accuracy-based evaluations often fail to capture behavioral differences between models, especially with limited test datasets, making it difficult to select or combine models effectively. Differential testing addresses this by generating test inputs that expose discrepancies in DNN model behavior. However, existing approaches face significant limitations: many rely on model internals or are constrained by available seed inputs. To address these challenges, we propose DiffGAN, a black-box test image generation approach for differential testing of DNN models. DiffGAN leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II to generate diverse and valid triggering inputs that reveal behavioral discrepancies between models. DiffGAN employs two custom fitness functions, focusing on diversity and divergence, to guide the exploration of the GAN input space and identify discrepancies between models' outputs. By strategically searching this space, DiffGAN generates inputs with specific features that trigger differences in model behavior. DiffGAN is black-box, making it applicable in more situations. We evaluate DiffGAN on eight DNN model pairs trained on widely used image datasets. Our results show DiffGAN significantly outperforms a SOTA baseline, generating four times more triggering inputs, with greater diversity and validity, within the same budget. Additionally, the generated inputs improve the accuracy of a machine learning-based model selection mechanism, which selects the best-performing model based on input characteristics and can serve as a smart output voting mechanism when using alternative models.

Abstract: The features of self-supervised vision transformers (ViTs) contain strong semantic and positional information relevant to downstream tasks like object localization and segmentation. Recent works combine these features with traditional methods like clustering, graph partitioning or region correlations to achieve impressive baselines without finetuning or training additional networks. We leverage upsampled features from ViT networks (e.g DINOv2) in two workflows: in a clustering based approach for object localization and segmentation, and paired with standard classifiers in weakly supervised materials segmentation. Both show strong performance on benchmarks, especially in weakly supervised segmentation where the ViT features capture complex relationships inaccessible to classical approaches. We expect the flexibility and generalizability of these features will both speed up and strengthen materials characterization, from segmentation to property-prediction.

Abstract: Inverse problems arise in many applications, especially tomographic imaging. We develop a Learned Alternating Minimization Algorithm (LAMA) to solve such problems via two-block optimization by synergizing data-driven and classical techniques with proven convergence. LAMA is naturally induced by a variational model with learnable regularizers in both data and image domains, parameterized as composite functions of neural networks trained with domain-specific data. We allow these regularizers to be nonconvex and nonsmooth to extract features from data effectively. We minimize the overall objective function using Nesterov's smoothing technique and residual learning architecture. It is demonstrated that LAMA reduces network complexity, improves memory efficiency, and enhances reconstruction accuracy, stability, and interpretability. Extensive experiments show that LAMA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmark datasets for Computed Tomography.

Abstract: Robustness audits of deep neural networks (DNN) provide a means to uncover model sensitivities to the challenging real-world imaging conditions that significantly degrade DNN performance in-the-wild. Such conditions are often the result of multiple interacting factors inherent to the environment, sensor, or processing pipeline and may lead to complex image distortions that are not easily categorized. When robustness audits are limited to a set of isolated imaging effects or distortions, the results cannot be (easily) transferred to real-world conditions where image corruptions may be more complex or nuanced. To address this challenge, we present a new alternative robustness auditing method that uses causal inference to measure DNN sensitivities to the factors of the imaging process that cause complex distortions. Our approach uses causal models to explicitly encode assumptions about the domain-relevant factors and their interactions. Then, through extensive experiments on natural and rendered images across multiple vision tasks, we show that our approach reliably estimates causal effects of each factor on DNN performance using only observational domain data. These causal effects directly tie DNN sensitivities to observable properties of the imaging pipeline in the domain of interest towards reducing the risk of unexpected DNN failures when deployed in that domain.

<title>Modality and Task Adaptation for Enhanced Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval</title>

Abstract: As a challenging vision-language task, Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) is designed to retrieve target images using bi-modal (image+text) queries. Typical ZS-CIR methods employ an inversion network to generate pseudo-word tokens that effectively represent the input semantics. However, the inversion-based methods suffer from two inherent issues: First, the task discrepancy exists because inversion training and CIR inference involve different objectives. Second, the modality discrepancy arises from the input feature distribution mismatch between training and inference. To this end, we propose a lightweight post-hoc framework, consisting of two components: (1) A new text-anchored triplet construction pipeline leverages a large language model (LLM) to transform a standard image-text dataset into a triplet dataset, where a textual description serves as the target of each triplet. (2) The MoTa-Adapter, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, adapts the dual encoder to the CIR task using our constructed triplet data. Specifically, on the text side, multiple sets of learnable task prompts are integrated via a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer to capture task-specific priors and handle different types of modifications. On the image side, MoTa-Adapter modulates the inversion network's input to better match the downstream text encoder. In addition, an entropy-based optimization strategy is proposed to assign greater weight to challenging samples, thus ensuring efficient adaptation. Experiments show that, with the incorporation of our proposed components, inversion-based methods achieve significant improvements, reaching state-of-the-art performance across four widely-used benchmarks. All data and code will be made publicly available.

<title>Interpretable Estimation of CNN Deep Feature Density using Copula and the Generalized Characteristic Function</title>

Abstract: We present a novel empirical approach toward estimating the Probability Density Function (PDF) of the deep features of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Estimating the PDF of deep CNN features is an important task, because it will yield new insight into deep representations. Moreover, characterizing the statistical behavior has implications for the feasibility of promising downstream tasks such as density based anomaly detection. Expressive, yet interpretable estimation of the deep feature PDF is challenging due to the Curse of Dimensionality (CoD) as well as our limited ability to comprehend high-dimensional inter-dependencies. Our novel estimation technique combines copula analysis with the Method of Orthogonal Moments (MOM), in order to directly estimate the Generalized Characteristic Function (GCF) of the multivariate deep feature PDF. We find that the one-dimensional marginals of non-negative deep CNN features after major blocks are not well approximated by a Gaussian distribution, and that the features of deep layers are much better approximated by the Exponential, Gamma, and/or Weibull distributions. Furthermore, we observe that deep features become increasingly long-tailed with network depth, although surprisingly the rate of this increase is much slower than theoretical estimates. Finally, we observe that many deep features exhibit strong dependence (either correlation or anti-correlation) with other extremely strong detections, even if these features are independent within typical ranges. We elaborate on these findings in our discussion, where we hypothesize that the long-tail of large valued features corresponds to the strongest computer vision detections of semantic targets, which would imply that these large-valued features are not outliers but rather an important detection signal.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), grounding and referring capabilities have gained increasing attention for achieving detailed understanding and flexible user interaction. However, these capabilities still remain underdeveloped in visual document understanding due to the scarcity of fine-grained datasets and comprehensive benchmarks. To fill this gap, we propose the DOcument Grounding and Referring data engine (DOGR-Engine), which generates two types of high-quality fine-grained document data: (1) multi-granular parsing data to improve text localization and recognition, and (2) instruction-tuning data to activate MLLMs' grounding and referring capabilities in dialogue and reasoning. Using the DOGR-Engine, we construct DOGR-Bench, a benchmark covering seven grounding and referring tasks across three document types (chart, poster, and PDF document), offering a comprehensive evaluation of fine-grained document understanding. Leveraging the generated data, we further develop DOGR, a strong baseline model that excels in text localization and recognition, while precisely grounds and refers to key textual information during conversation and reasoning, thereby advancing document understanding to a finer granularity and enable flexible interaction paradigms.

Abstract: Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) aims to extract visual information perceived by humans from brain activity recorded through functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Despite notable advancements in recent years, existing studies in VBU continue to face the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, where models lose knowledge from prior subjects as they adapt to new ones. Addressing continual learning in this field is, therefore, essential. This paper introduces a novel framework called Continual Learning for Vision-Brain (COBRA) to address continual learning in VBU. Our approach includes three novel modules: a Subject Commonality (SC) module, a Prompt-based Subject Specific (PSS) module, and a transformer-based module for fMRI, denoted as MRIFormer module. The SC module captures shared vision-brain patterns across subjects, preserving this knowledge as the model encounters new subjects, thereby reducing the impact of catastrophic forgetting. On the other hand, the PSS module learns unique vision-brain patterns specific to each subject. Finally, the MRIFormer module contains a transformer encoder and decoder that learns the fMRI features for VBU from common and specific patterns. In a continual learning setup, COBRA is trained in new PSS and MRIFormer modules for new subjects, leaving the modules of previous subjects unaffected. As a result, COBRA effectively addresses catastrophic forgetting and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both continual learning and vision-brain reconstruction tasks, surpassing previous methods.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies offer a promising paradigm to mitigate the limitations of constrained observability in single-vehicle systems. Prior work primarily focuses on single-frame cooperative perception, which fuses agents' information across different spatial locations but ignores temporal cues and temporal tasks (e.g., temporal perception and prediction). In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal fusion in V2X scenarios and design one-step and multi-step communication strategies (when to transmit) as well as examine their integration with three fusion strategies - early, late, and intermediate (what to transmit), providing comprehensive benchmarks with 11 fusion models (how to fuse). Furthermore, we propose V2XPnP, a novel intermediate fusion framework within one-step communication for end-to-end perception and prediction. Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple agents, frames, and high-definition maps. Moreover, we introduce the V2XPnP Sequential Dataset that supports all V2X collaboration modes and addresses the limitations of existing real-world datasets, which are restricted to single-frame or single-mode cooperation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perception and prediction tasks.

Abstract: Foreground-conditioned inpainting aims to seamlessly fill the background region of an image by utilizing the provided foreground subject and a text description. While existing T2I-based image inpainting methods can be applied to this task, they suffer from issues of subject shape expansion, distortion, or impaired ability to align with the text description, resulting in inconsistencies between the visual elements and the text description. To address these challenges, we propose Pinco, a plug-and-play foreground-conditioned inpainting adapter that generates high-quality backgrounds with good text alignment while effectively preserving the shape of the foreground subject. Firstly, we design a Self-Consistent Adapter that integrates the foreground subject features into the layout-related self-attention layer, which helps to alleviate conflicts between the text and subject features by ensuring that the model can effectively consider the foreground subject's characteristics while processing the overall image layout. Secondly, we design a Decoupled Image Feature Extraction method that employs distinct architectures to extract semantic and spatial features separately, significantly improving subject feature extraction and ensuring high-quality preservation of the subject's shape. Thirdly, to ensure precise utilization of the extracted features and to focus attention on the subject region, we introduce a Shared Positional Embedding Anchor, greatly improving the model's understanding of subject features and boosting training efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance and efficiency in foreground-conditioned inpainting.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been recognized for their ability to generate images that are not only visually appealing but also of high artistic quality. As a result, Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation has been proposed to leverage region-specific positions and descriptions to enable more precise and controllable generation. However, previous methods primarily focus on UNet-based models (\eg SD1.5 and SDXL), and limited effort has explored Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiTs), which have demonstrated powerful image generation capabilities. Enabling MM-DiT for layout-to-image generation seems straightforward but is challenging due to the complexity of how layout is introduced, integrated, and balanced among multiple modalities. To this end, we explore various network variants to efficiently incorporate layout guidance into MM-DiT, and ultimately present SiamLayout. To inherit the advantages of MM-DiT, we use a separate set of network weights to process the layout, treating it as equally important as the image and text modalities. Meanwhile, to alleviate the competition among modalities, we decouple the image-layout interaction into a siamese branch alongside the image-text one and fuse them in the later stage. Moreover, we contribute a large-scale layout dataset, named LayoutSAM, which includes 2.7 million image-text pairs and 10.7 million entities. Each entity is annotated with a bounding box and a detailed description. We further construct the LayoutSAM-Eval benchmark as a comprehensive tool for evaluating the L2I generation quality. Finally, we introduce the Layout Designer, which taps into the potential of large language models in layout planning, transforming them into experts in layout generation and optimization. These components form CreatiLayout -- a systematic solution that integrates the layout model, dataset, and planner for creative layout-to-image generation.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) across diverse tasks, the substantial training and inference costs impede their advancement. In this paper, we propose p-MoD, an efficient MLLM architecture that significantly reduces training and inference costs while maintaining model performance. The majority of computation in MLLMs stems from the overwhelming volume of vision tokens processed by the transformer-based LLM. Accordingly, we leverage the Mixture-of-Depths (MoD) mechanism, where each LLM layer selects essential vision tokens to process while skipping redundant ones. However, integrating MoD into MLLMs is non-trivial. To address the challenges of training and inference stability as well as limited training data, we adapt the MoD module with two novel designs: tanh-gated weight normalization (TanhNorm) and symmetric token reweighting (STRing). Moreover, we observe that vision tokens exhibit higher redundancy in deeper layers and thus design a progressive ratio decay (PRD) strategy, which gradually reduces the token retention ratio layer by layer, employing a shifted cosine schedule. This crucial design fully unleashes the potential of MoD, significantly boosting the efficiency and performance of our models. Extensive experiments on two baseline models across 15 benchmarks show that our model matches or even surpasses the performance of corresponding baselines, while requiring only 55.6% TFLOPs and 53.7% KV cache storage during inference, and 77.7% GPU hours during training.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated exceptional comprehension and interpretation capabilities in Autonomous Driving (AD) by incorporating large language models. Despite the advancements, current data-driven AD approaches tend to concentrate on a single dataset and specific tasks, neglecting their overall capabilities and ability to generalize. To bridge these gaps, we propose RoboTron-Drive, a general large multimodal model designed to process diverse data inputs, such as images and multi-view videos, while performing a broad spectrum of AD tasks, including perception, prediction, and planning. Initially, the model undergoes curriculum pre-training to process varied visual signals and perform basic visual comprehension and perception tasks. Subsequently, we augment and standardize various AD datasets to finetune the model, resulting in an all-in-one LMM for autonomous driving. To assess the general capabilities and generalization ability, we conduct evaluations on six public benchmarks and undertake zero-shot transfer on three unseen datasets, where RoboTron-Drive achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. We hope RoboTron-Drive as a promising solution for AD in the real world. Project page with code: https://github.com/zhijian11/RoboTron-Drive.

Abstract: A 3D scene graph represents a compact scene model by capturing both the objects present and the semantic relationships between them, making it a promising structure for robotic applications. To effectively interact with users, an embodied intelligent agent should be able to answer a wide range of natural language queries about the surrounding 3D environment. Large Language Models (LLMs) are beneficial solutions for user-robot interaction due to their natural language understanding and reasoning abilities. Recent methods for learning scene representations have shown that adapting these representations to the 3D world can significantly improve the quality of LLM responses. However, existing methods typically rely only on geometric information, such as object coordinates, and overlook the rich semantic relationships between objects. In this work, we propose 3DGraphLLM, a method for constructing a learnable representation of a 3D scene graph that explicitly incorporates semantic relationships. This representation is used as input to LLMs for performing 3D vision-language tasks. In our experiments on popular ScanRefer, Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, Sqa3D, and Scan2cap datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms baselines that do not leverage semantic relationships between objects. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/CognitiveAISystems/3DGraphLLM.

Abstract: Dynamic 3D scene representation and novel view synthesis are crucial for enabling immersive experiences required by AR/VR and metaverse applications. It is a challenging task due to the complexity of unconstrained real-world scenes and their temporal dynamics. In this paper, we reformulate the reconstruction of a time-varying 3D scene as approximating its underlying spatiotemporal 4D volume by optimizing a collection of native 4D primitives, i.e., 4D Gaussians, with explicit geometry and appearance modeling. Equipped with a tailored rendering pipeline, our representation can be end-to-end optimized using only photometric supervision while free viewpoint viewing at interactive frame rate, making it suitable for representing real world scene with complex dynamic. This approach has been the first solution to achieve real-time rendering of high-resolution, photorealistic novel views for complex dynamic scenes. To facilitate real-world applications, we derive several compact variants that effectively reduce the memory footprint to address its storage bottleneck. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of 4DGS in terms of visual quality and efficiency across a range of dynamic scene-related tasks (e.g., novel view synthesis, 4D generation, scene understanding) and scenarios (e.g., single object, indoor scenes, driving environments, synthetic and real data).

Abstract: Generative modeling aims to transform random noise into structured outputs. In this work, we enhance video diffusion models by allowing motion control via structured latent noise sampling. This is achieved by just a change in data: we pre-process training videos to yield structured noise. Consequently, our method is agnostic to diffusion model design, requiring no changes to model architectures or training pipelines. Specifically, we propose a novel noise warping algorithm, fast enough to run in real time, that replaces random temporal Gaussianity with correlated warped noise derived from optical flow fields, while preserving the spatial Gaussianity. The efficiency of our algorithm enables us to fine-tune modern video diffusion base models using warped noise with minimal overhead, and provide a one-stop solution for a wide range of user-friendly motion control: local object motion control, global camera movement control, and motion transfer. The harmonization between temporal coherence and spatial Gaussianity in our warped noise leads to effective motion control while maintaining per-frame pixel quality. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate the advantages of our method, making it a robust and scalable approach for controlling motion in video diffusion models.

Abstract: Snapshot Compressed Imaging (SCI) offers high-speed, low-bandwidth, and energy-efficient image acquisition, but remains challenged by low-light and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Moreover, practical hardware constraints in high-resolution sensors limit the use of large frame-sized masks, necessitating smaller, hardware-friendly designs. In this work, we present a novel SCI-based computer vision framework using pseudo-random binary masks of only 8$\times$8 in size for physically feasible implementations. At its core is CompDAE, a Compressive Denoising Autoencoder built on the STFormer architecture, designed to perform downstream tasks--such as edge detection and depth estimation--directly from noisy compressive raw pixel measurements without image reconstruction. CompDAE incorporates a rate-constrained training strategy inspired by BackSlash to promote compact, compressible models. A shared encoder paired with lightweight task-specific decoders enables a unified multi-task platform. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that CompDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly lower complexity, especially under ultra-low-light conditions where traditional CMOS and SCI pipelines fail.

Abstract: Egocentric vision systems aim to understand the spatial surroundings and the wearer's behavior inside it, including motions, activities, and interactions. We argue that egocentric systems must additionally detect physiological states to capture a person's attention and situational responses, which are critical for context-aware behavior modeling. In this paper, we propose egoPPG, a novel vision task for egocentric systems to recover a person's cardiac activity to aid downstream vision tasks. We introduce PulseFormer, a method to extract heart rate as a key indicator of physiological state from the eye tracking cameras on unmodified egocentric vision systems. PulseFormer continuously estimates the photoplethysmogram (PPG) from areas around the eyes and fuses motion cues from the headset's inertial measurement unit to track HR values. We demonstrate egoPPG's downstream benefit for a key task on EgoExo4D, an existing egocentric dataset for which we find PulseFormer's estimates of HR to improve proficiency estimation by 14%. To train and validate PulseFormer, we collected a dataset of 13+ hours of eye tracking videos from Project Aria and contact-based PPG signals as well as an electrocardiogram (ECG) for ground-truth HR values. Similar to EgoExo4D, 25 participants performed diverse everyday activities such as office work, cooking, dancing, and exercising, which induced significant natural motion and HR variation (44-164 bpm). Our model robustly estimates HR (MAE=7.67 bpm) and captures patterns (r=0.85). Our results show how egocentric systems may unify environmental and physiological tracking to better understand users and that egoPPG as a complementary task provides meaningful augmentations for existing datasets and tasks. We release our code, dataset, and HR augmentations for EgoExo4D to inspire research on physiology-aware egocentric tasks.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) leverages audio and visual modalities to improve robustness in noisy environments. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong performance in speech recognition, including AVSR. However, the long speech representations lead to high computational costs for LLMs. Prior methods compress inputs before feeding them to LLMs, but high compression often harms accuracy. To address this, we propose Llama-MTSK, the first Matryoshka-based Multimodal LLM for AVSR, which flexibly adapts audio-visual token allocation under varying compute constraints. Inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, our model encodes representations at multiple granularities with a single architecture, avoiding the need for separate models. For efficient fine-tuning, we introduce three LoRA-based strategies using global and scale-specific modules. Evaluations on major AVSR datasets show Llama-MTSK matches or outperforms models trained at fixed compression levels.

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs) often suffer from visual hallucination, where the generated responses contain inaccuracies that are not grounded in the visual input. Efforts to address this issue without model finetuning primarily mitigate hallucination by contrastively reducing language biases or amplifying the weights of visual embedding during decoding. However, these approaches remain limited in their ability to capture fine-grained visual details. In this work, we propose the Perception Magnifier (PM), a novel visual decoding method that iteratively isolates relevant visual tokens based on attention and magnifies the corresponding regions, spurring the model to concentrate on fine-grained visual details during decoding. By magnifying critical regions while preserving the structural and contextual information at each decoding step, PM allows the VLM to enhance its scrutiny of the visual input, hence producing more accurate and faithful responses. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PM not only achieves superior hallucination mitigation but also enhances language generation while preserving strong reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Flat minima, known to enhance generalization and robustness in supervised learning, remain largely unexplored in generative models. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of loss surface flatness in generative models, both theoretically and empirically, with a particular focus on diffusion models. We establish a theoretical claim that flatter minima improve robustness against perturbations in target prior distributions, leading to benefits such as reduced exposure bias -- where errors in noise estimation accumulate over iterations -- and significantly improved resilience to model quantization, preserving generative performance even under strong quantization constraints. We further observe that Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), which explicitly controls the degree of flatness, effectively enhances flatness in diffusion models even surpassing the indirectly promoting flatness methods -- Input Perturbation (IP) which enforces the Lipschitz condition, ensembling-based approach like Stochastic Weight Averaging (SWA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) -- are less effective. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, LSUN Tower, and FFHQ, we demonstrate that flat minima in diffusion models indeed improve not only generative performance but also robustness.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across various domains; however, their ability to comprehend driving scenes remains less proven. The complexity of driving scenarios, which includes multi-view information, poses significant challenges for existing MLLMs. In this paper, we introduce NuPlanQA-Eval, a multi-view, multi-modal evaluation benchmark for driving scene understanding. To further support generalization to multi-view driving scenarios, we also propose NuPlanQA-1M, a large-scale dataset comprising 1M real-world visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. For context-aware analysis of traffic scenes, we categorize our dataset into nine subtasks across three core skills: Road Environment Perception, Spatial Relations Recognition, and Ego-Centric Reasoning. Furthermore, we present BEV-LLM, integrating Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) features from multi-view images into MLLMs. Our evaluation results reveal key challenges that existing MLLMs face in driving scene-specific perception and spatial reasoning from ego-centric perspectives. In contrast, BEV-LLM demonstrates remarkable adaptability to this domain, outperforming other models in six of the nine subtasks. These findings highlight how BEV integration enhances multi-view MLLMs while also identifying key areas that require further refinement for effective adaptation to driving scenes. To facilitate further research, we publicly release NuPlanQA at https://github.com/sungyeonparkk/NuPlanQA.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has shown remarkable performance in novel view synthesis but requires numerous multi-view images, limiting its practicality in few-shot scenarios. Ray augmentation has been proposed to alleviate overfitting caused by sparse training data by generating additional rays. However, existing methods, which generate augmented rays only near the original rays, exhibit pronounced floaters and appearance distortions due to limited viewpoints and inconsistent rays obstructed by nearby obstacles and complex surfaces. To address these problems, we propose DivCon-NeRF, which introduces novel sphere-based ray augmentations to significantly enhance both diversity and consistency. By employing a virtual sphere centered at the predicted surface point, our method generates diverse augmented rays from all 360-degree directions, facilitated by our consistency mask that effectively filters out inconsistent rays. We introduce tailored loss functions that leverage these augmentations, effectively reducing floaters and visual distortions. Consequently, our method outperforms existing few-shot NeRF approaches on the Blender, LLFF, and DTU datasets. Furthermore, DivCon-NeRF demonstrates strong generalizability by effectively integrating with both regularization- and framework-based few-shot NeRFs. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in customized video generation have led to significant improvements in the simultaneous adaptation of appearance and motion. While prior methods typically decouple appearance and motion training, the stage-wise strategy often introduces concept interference, resulting in inaccurate rendering of appearance features or motion patterns. Another challenge is appearance contamination, where background and foreground elements from reference videos distort the customized subject. In this work, we propose JointTuner, a novel framework that enables joint optimization of both appearance and motion components by leveraging two key innovations: Synaptic Low-Rank Adaptation (Synaptic LoRA) and Appearance-independent Temporal Loss (AiT Loss). Synaptic LoRA introduces a synaptic regulator, implemented as a context-aware linear activation layer, to dynamically guide LoRA modules to focus on either subject appearance or motion patterns, thereby enabling consistent optimization across spatial and temporal dimensions. AiT Loss disrupts the gradient flow of appearance-related components, guiding the model to focus exclusively on motion learning and minimizing appearance interference. JointTuner is compatible with both UNet-based models (e.g., ZeroScope) and Diffusion Transformer-based models (e.g., CogVideoX), supporting the generation of longer and higher-quality customized videos. Additionally, we present a systematic evaluation framework for appearance-motion combined customization, covering 90 combinations evaluated along four critical dimensions: semantic alignment, motion dynamism, temporal consistency, and perceptual quality.

Abstract: Wide-angle cameras, despite their popularity for content creation, suffer from distortion-induced facial stretching-especially at the edge of the lens-which degrades visual appeal. To address this issue, we propose a structure-to-detail portrait correction model named ImagePC. It integrates the long-range awareness of the transformer and multi-step denoising of diffusion models into a unified framework, achieving global structural robustness and local detail refinement. Besides, considering the high cost of obtaining video labels, we then repurpose ImagePC for unlabeled wide-angle videos (termed VideoPC), by spatiotemporal diffusion adaption with spatial consistency and temporal smoothness constraints. For the former, we encourage the denoised image to approximate pseudo labels following the wide-angle distortion distribution pattern, while for the latter, we derive rectification trajectories with backward optical flows and smooth them. Compared with ImagePC, VideoPC maintains high-quality facial corrections in space and mitigates the potential temporal shakes sequentially in blind scenarios. Finally, to establish an evaluation benchmark and train the framework, we establish a video portrait dataset with a large diversity in the number of people, lighting conditions, and background. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing solutions quantitatively and qualitatively, contributing to high-fidelity wide-angle videos with stable and natural portraits. The codes and dataset will be available.

Abstract: Precise optical inspection in industrial applications is crucial for minimizing scrap rates and reducing the associated costs. Besides merely detecting if a product is anomalous or not, it is crucial to know the distinct type of defect, such as a bent, cut, or scratch. The ability to recognize the "exact" defect type enables automated treatments of the anomalies in modern production lines. Current methods are limited to solely detecting whether a product is defective or not without providing any insights on the defect type, nevertheless detecting and identifying multiple defects. We propose MultiADS, a zero-shot learning approach, able to perform Multi-type Anomaly Detection and Segmentation. The architecture of MultiADS comprises CLIP and extra linear layers to align the visual- and textual representation in a joint feature space. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal, is the first approach to perform a multi-type anomaly segmentation task in zero-shot learning. Contrary to the other baselines, our approach i) generates specific anomaly masks for each distinct defect type, ii) learns to distinguish defect types, and iii) simultaneously identifies multiple defect types present in an anomalous product. Additionally, our approach outperforms zero/few-shot learning SoTA methods on image-level and pixel-level anomaly detection and segmentation tasks on five commonly used datasets: MVTec-AD, Visa, MPDD, MAD and Real-IAD.

Abstract: Images captured under low-light conditions present significant limitations in many applications, as poor lighting can obscure details, reduce contrast, and hide noise. Removing the illumination effects and enhancing the quality of such images is crucial for many tasks, such as image segmentation and object detection. In this paper, we propose a variational method for low-light image enhancement based on the Retinex decomposition into illumination, reflectance, and noise components. A color correction pre-processing step is applied to the low-light image, which is then used as the observed input in the decomposition. Moreover, our model integrates a novel nonlocal gradient-type fidelity term designed to preserve structural details. Additionally, we propose an automatic gamma correction module. Building on the proposed variational approach, we extend the model by introducing its deep unfolding counterpart, in which the proximal operators are replaced with learnable networks. We propose cross-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in both the nonlocal prior of the reflectance and the nonlocal gradient-based constraint. Experimental results demonstrate that both methods compare favorably with several recent and state-of-the-art techniques across different datasets. In particular, despite not relying on learning strategies, the variational model outperforms most deep learning approaches both visually and in terms of quality metrics.

Abstract: Existing pedestrian attribute recognition methods are generally developed based on RGB frame cameras. However, these approaches are constrained by the limitations of RGB cameras, such as sensitivity to lighting conditions and motion blur, which hinder their performance. Furthermore, current attribute recognition primarily focuses on analyzing pedestrians' external appearance and clothing, lacking an exploration of emotional dimensions. In this paper, we revisit these issues and propose a novel multi-modal RGB-Event attribute recognition task by drawing inspiration from the advantages of event cameras in low-light, high-speed, and low-power consumption. Specifically, we introduce the first large-scale multi-modal pedestrian attribute recognition dataset, termed EventPAR, comprising 100K paired RGB-Event samples that cover 50 attributes related to both appearance and six human emotions, diverse scenes, and various seasons. By retraining and evaluating mainstream PAR models on this dataset, we establish a comprehensive benchmark and provide a solid foundation for future research in terms of data and algorithmic baselines. In addition, we propose a novel RWKV-based multi-modal pedestrian attribute recognition framework, featuring an RWKV visual encoder and an asymmetric RWKV fusion module. Extensive experiments are conducted on our proposed dataset as well as two simulated datasets (MARS-Attribute and DukeMTMC-VID-Attribute), achieving state-of-the-art results. The source code and dataset will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenPAR

Abstract: Recent advances in Talking Head Generation (THG) have achieved impressive lip synchronization and visual quality through diffusion models; yet existing methods struggle to generate emotionally expressive portraits while preserving speaker identity. We identify three critical limitations in current emotional talking head generation: insufficient utilization of audio's inherent emotional cues, identity leakage in emotion representations, and isolated learning of emotion correlations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework dubbed as DICE-Talk, following the idea of disentangling identity with emotion, and then cooperating emotions with similar characteristics. First, we develop a disentangled emotion embedder that jointly models audio-visual emotional cues through cross-modal attention, representing emotions as identity-agnostic Gaussian distributions. Second, we introduce a correlation-enhanced emotion conditioning module with learnable Emotion Banks that explicitly capture inter-emotion relationships through vector quantization and attention-based feature aggregation. Third, we design an emotion discrimination objective that enforces affective consistency during the diffusion process through latent-space classification. Extensive experiments on MEAD and HDTF datasets demonstrate our method's superiority, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in emotion accuracy while maintaining competitive lip-sync performance. Qualitative results and user studies further confirm our method's ability to generate identity-preserving portraits with rich, correlated emotional expressions that naturally adapt to unseen identities.

Abstract: While accurate and user-friendly Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is crucial for industrial design and manufacturing, existing methods still struggle to achieve this due to their over-simplified representations or architectures incapable of supporting multimodal design requirements. In this paper, we attempt to tackle this problem from both methods and datasets aspects. First, we propose a cascade MAR with topology predictor (CMT), the first multimodal framework for CAD generation based on Boundary Representation (B-Rep). Specifically, the cascade MAR can effectively capture the ``edge-counters-surface'' priors that are essential in B-Reps, while the topology predictor directly estimates topology in B-Reps from the compact tokens in MAR. Second, to facilitate large-scale training, we develop a large-scale multimodal CAD dataset, mmABC, which includes over 1.3 million B-Rep models with multimodal annotations, including point clouds, text descriptions, and multi-view images. Extensive experiments show the superior of CMT in both conditional and unconditional CAD generation tasks. For example, we improve Coverage and Valid ratio by +10.68% and +10.3%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art methods on ABC in unconditional generation. CMT also improves +4.01 Chamfer on image conditioned CAD generation on mmABC.

Abstract: Multi-focus color image fusion refers to integrating multiple partially focused color images to create a single all-in-focus color image. However, existing methods struggle with complex real-world scenarios due to limitations in handling color information and intricate textures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a quaternion multi-focus color image fusion framework to perform high-quality color image fusion completely in the quaternion domain. This framework introduces 1) a quaternion sparse decomposition model to jointly learn fine-scale image details and structure information of color images in an iterative fashion for high-precision focus detection, 2) a quaternion base-detail fusion strategy to individually fuse base-scale and detail-scale results across multiple color images for preserving structure and detail information, and 3) a quaternion structural similarity refinement strategy to adaptively select optimal patches from initial fusion results and obtain the final fused result for preserving fine details and ensuring spatially consistent outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are crucial for computer vision tasks on resource-constrained devices. Quantization effectively compresses these models, reducing storage size and energy cost. However, in modern depthwise-separable architectures, the computational cost is distributed unevenly across its components, with pointwise operations being the most expensive. By applying a general quantization scheme to this imbalanced cost distribution, existing quantization approaches fail to fully exploit potential efficiency gains. To this end, we introduce PROM, a straightforward approach for quantizing modern depthwise-separable convolutional networks by selectively using two distinct bit-widths. Specifically, pointwise convolutions are quantized to ternary weights, while the remaining modules use 8-bit weights, which is achieved through a simple quantization-aware training procedure. Additionally, by quantizing activations to 8-bit, our method transforms pointwise convolutions with ternary weights into int8 additions, which enjoy broad support across hardware platforms and effectively eliminates the need for expensive multiplications. Applying PROM to MobileNetV2 reduces the model's energy cost by more than an order of magnitude (23.9x) and its storage size by 2.7x compared to the float16 baseline while retaining similar classification performance on ImageNet. Our method advances the Pareto frontier for energy consumption vs. top-1 accuracy for quantized convolutional models on ImageNet. PROM addresses the challenges of quantizing depthwise-separable convolutional networks to both ternary and 8-bit weights, offering a simple way to reduce energy cost and storage size.

Abstract: Performance comparisons are fundamental in medical imaging Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, often driving claims of superiority based on relative improvements in common performance metrics. However, such claims frequently rely solely on empirical mean performance. In this paper, we investigate whether newly proposed methods genuinely outperform the state of the art by analyzing a representative cohort of medical imaging papers. We quantify the probability of false claims based on a Bayesian approach that leverages reported results alongside empirically estimated model congruence to estimate whether the relative ranking of methods is likely to have occurred by chance. According to our results, the majority (>80%) of papers claims outperformance when introducing a new method. Our analysis further revealed a high probability (>5%) of false outperformance claims in 86% of classification papers and 53% of segmentation papers. These findings highlight a critical flaw in current benchmarking practices: claims of outperformance in medical imaging AI are frequently unsubstantiated, posing a risk of misdirecting future research efforts.

Abstract: The segmentation of substantial brain lesions is a significant and challenging task in the field of medical image segmentation. Substantial brain lesions in brain imaging exhibit high heterogeneity, with indistinct boundaries between lesion regions and normal brain tissue. Small lesions in single slices are difficult to identify, making the accurate and reproducible segmentation of abnormal regions, as well as their feature description, highly complex. Existing methods have the following limitations: 1) They rely solely on single-modal information for learning, neglecting the multi-modal information commonly used in diagnosis. This hampers the ability to comprehensively acquire brain lesion information from multiple perspectives and prevents the effective integration and utilization of multi-modal data inputs, thereby limiting a holistic understanding of lesions. 2) They are constrained by the amount of data available, leading to low sensitivity to small lesions and difficulty in detecting subtle pathological changes. 3) Current SAM-based models rely on external prompts, which cannot achieve automatic segmentation and, to some extent, affect diagnostic efficiency.To address these issues, we have developed a large-scale fully automated segmentation model specifically designed for brain lesion segmentation, named BrainSegDMLF. This model has the following features: 1) Dynamic Modal Interactive Fusion (DMIF) module that processes and integrates multi-modal data during the encoding process, providing the SAM encoder with more comprehensive modal information. 2) Layer-by-Layer Upsampling Decoder, enabling the model to extract rich low-level and high-level features even with limited data, thereby detecting the presence of small lesions. 3) Automatic segmentation masks, allowing the model to generate lesion masks automatically without requiring manual prompts.

Abstract: This work aims at a challenging task: human action-reaction synthesis, i.e., generating human reactions conditioned on the action sequence of another person. Currently, autoregressive modeling approaches with vector quantization (VQ) have achieved remarkable performance in motion generation tasks. However, VQ has inherent disadvantages, including quantization information loss, low codebook utilization, etc. In addition, while dividing the body into separate units can be beneficial, the computational complexity needs to be considered. Also, the importance of mutual perception among units is often neglected. In this work, we propose MARRS, a novel framework designed to generate coordinated and fine-grained reaction motions using continuous representations. Initially, we present the Unit-distinguished Motion Variational AutoEncoder (UD-VAE), which segments the entire body into distinct body and hand units, encoding each independently. Subsequently, we propose Action-Conditioned Fusion (ACF), which involves randomly masking a subset of reactive tokens and extracting specific information about the body and hands from the active tokens. Furthermore, we introduce Adaptive Unit Modulation (AUM) to facilitate interaction between body and hand units by using the information from one unit to adaptively modulate the other. Finally, for the diffusion model, we employ a compact MLP as a noise predictor for each distinct body unit and incorporate the diffusion loss to model the probability distribution of each token. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture design has attracted growing research interests. However, they typically apply single receptive field (RF), small asymmetric RFs, or pyramid RFs to learn different feature representations, still encountering two significant challenges in medical image classification tasks: 1) They have limitations in capturing diverse lesion characteristics efficiently, e.g., tiny, coordination, small and salient, which have unique roles on the classification results, especially imbalanced medical image classification. 2) The predictions generated by those CNNs are often unfair/biased, bringing a high risk when employing them to real-world medical diagnosis conditions. To tackle these issues, we develop a new concept, Expert-Like Reparameterization of Heterogeneous Pyramid Receptive Fields (ERoHPRF), to simultaneously boost medical image classification performance and fairness. This concept aims to mimic the multi-expert consultation mode by applying the well-designed heterogeneous pyramid RF bag to capture lesion characteristics with varying significances effectively via convolution operations with multiple heterogeneous kernel sizes. Additionally, ERoHPRF introduces an expert-like structural reparameterization technique to merge its parameters with the two-stage strategy, ensuring competitive computation cost and inference speed through comparisons to a single RF. To manifest the effectiveness and generalization ability of ERoHPRF, we incorporate it into mainstream efficient CNN architectures. The extensive experiments show that our proposed ERoHPRF maintains a better trade-off than state-of-the-art methods in terms of medical image classification, fairness, and computation overhead.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve remarkable performance within image generation via the transformer architecture. Conventionally, DiTs are constructed by stacking serial isotropic global modeling transformers, which face significant quadratic computational cost. However, through empirical analysis, we find that DiTs do not rely as heavily on global information as previously believed. In fact, most layers exhibit significant redundancy in global computation. Additionally, conventional attention mechanisms suffer from low-frequency inertia, limiting their efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Pseudo Shifted Window Attention (PSWA), which fundamentally mitigates global attention redundancy. PSWA achieves moderate global-local information through window attention. It further utilizes a high-frequency bridging branch to simulate shifted window operations, which both enrich the high-frequency information and strengthen inter-window connections. Furthermore, we propose the Progressive Coverage Channel Allocation (PCCA) strategy that captures high-order attention without additional computational cost. Based on these innovations, we propose a series of Pseudo \textbf{P}rogressive D\textbf{i}ffusion \textbf{T}ransformer (\textbf{PiT}). Our extensive experiments show their superior performance; for example, our proposed PiT-L achieves 54\%$\uparrow$ FID improvement over DiT-XL/2 while using less computation.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction offers an intuitive and efficient scene understanding and has attracted significant interest in autonomous driving perception. Existing approaches either rely on full supervision, which demands costly voxel-level annotations, or on self-supervision, which provides limited guidance and yields suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose OccLE, a Label-Efficient 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction that takes images and LiDAR as inputs and maintains high performance with limited voxel annotations. Our intuition is to decouple the semantic and geometric learning tasks and then fuse the learned feature grids from both tasks for the final semantic occupancy prediction. Therefore, the semantic branch distills 2D foundation model to provide aligned pseudo labels for 2D and 3D semantic learning. The geometric branch integrates image and LiDAR inputs in cross-plane synergy based on their inherency, employing semi-supervision to enhance geometry learning. We fuse semantic-geometric feature grids through Dual Mamba and incorporate a scatter-accumulated projection to supervise unannotated prediction with aligned pseudo labels. Experiments show that OccLE achieves competitive performance with only 10\% of voxel annotations on the SemanticKITTI and Occ3D-nuScenes datasets.

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for perceiving surrounding scenes in autonomous driving. However, existing works rely on explicit occupancy state inference, leading to numerous incorrect feature assignments, and insufficient samples restrict the learning of occupancy class inference. To address these challenges, we propose leveraging Depth awareness and Semantic aid to boost camera-based 3D semantic Occupancy prediction (DSOcc). We jointly perform occupancy state and occupancy class inference, where soft occupancy confidence is calculated by non-learning method and multiplied with image features to make voxels aware of depth, enabling adaptive implicit occupancy state inference. Instead of enhancing feature learning, we directly utilize well-trained image semantic segmentation and fuse multiple frames with their occupancy probabilities to aid occupancy class inference, thereby enhancing robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that DSOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset among camera-based methods.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have achieved remarkable results in video synthesis but require iterative denoising steps, leading to substantial computational overhead. Consistency Models have made significant progress in accelerating diffusion models. However, directly applying them to video diffusion models often results in severe degradation of temporal consistency and appearance details. In this paper, by analyzing the training dynamics of Consistency Models, we identify a key conflicting learning dynamics during the distillation process: there is a significant discrepancy in the optimization gradients and loss contributions across different timesteps. This discrepancy prevents the distilled student model from achieving an optimal state, leading to compromised temporal consistency and degraded appearance details. To address this issue, we propose a parameter-efficient \textbf{Dual-Expert Consistency Model~(DCM)}, where a semantic expert focuses on learning semantic layout and motion, while a detail expert specializes in fine detail refinement. Furthermore, we introduce Temporal Coherence Loss to improve motion consistency for the semantic expert and apply GAN and Feature Matching Loss to enhance the synthesis quality of the detail expert.Our approach achieves state-of-the-art visual quality with significantly reduced sampling steps, demonstrating the effectiveness of expert specialization in video diffusion model distillation.

Abstract: A major challenge in developing robust and generalizable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems for smart homes is the lack of large and diverse labeled datasets. Variations in home layouts, sensor configurations, and individual behaviors further exacerbate this issue. To address this, we leverage the idea of embodied AI agents-virtual agents that perceive and act within simulated environments guided by internal world models. We introduce AgentSense, a virtual data generation pipeline in which agents live out daily routines in simulated smart homes, with behavior guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). The LLM generates diverse synthetic personas and realistic routines grounded in the environment, which are then decomposed into fine-grained actions. These actions are executed in an extended version of the VirtualHome simulator, which we augment with virtual ambient sensors that record the agents' activities. Our approach produces rich, privacy-preserving sensor data that reflects real-world diversity. We evaluate AgentSense on five real HAR datasets. Models pretrained on the generated data consistently outperform baselines, especially in low-resource settings. Furthermore, combining the generated virtual sensor data with a small amount of real data achieves performance comparable to training on full real-world datasets. These results highlight the potential of using LLM-guided embodied agents for scalable and cost-effective sensor data generation in HAR.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong performance in conditional generation by progressively denoising Gaussian samples toward a target data distribution. This denoising process can be interpreted as a form of hill climbing in a learned latent space, where the model iteratively refines a sample toward regions of higher probability. However, this learned climbing often converges to local optima with plausible but suboptimal generations due to latent space complexity and suboptimal initialization. While prior efforts often strengthen guidance signals or introduce fixed exploration strategies to address this, they exhibit limited capacity to escape steep local maxima. In contrast, we propose Controlled Random Zigzag Sampling (Ctrl-Z Sampling), a novel sampling strategy that adaptively detects and escapes such traps through controlled exploration. In each diffusion step, we first identify potential local maxima using a reward model. Upon such detection, we inject noise and revert to a previous, noisier state to escape the current plateau. The reward model then evaluates candidate trajectories, accepting only those that offer improvement, otherwise scheming progressively deeper explorations when nearby alternatives fail. This controlled zigzag process allows dynamic alternation between forward refinement and backward exploration, enhancing both alignment and visual quality in the generated outputs. The proposed method is model-agnostic and also compatible with existing diffusion frameworks. Experimental results show that Ctrl-Z Sampling substantially improves generation quality with only around 6.72x increase in the number of function evaluations.

Abstract: Generation of images containing multiple humans, performing complex actions, while preserving their facial identities, is a significant challenge. A major factor contributing to this is the lack of a dedicated benchmark. To address this, we introduce MultiHuman-Testbench, a novel benchmark for rigorously evaluating generative models for multi-human generation. The benchmark comprises 1800 samples, including carefully curated text prompts, describing a range of simple to complex human actions. These prompts are matched with a total of 5,550 unique human face images, sampled uniformly to ensure diversity across age, ethnic background, and gender. Alongside captions, we provide human-selected pose conditioning images which accurately match the prompt. We propose a multi-faceted evaluation suite employing four key metrics to quantify face count, ID similarity, prompt alignment, and action detection. We conduct a thorough evaluation of a diverse set of models, including zero-shot approaches and training-based methods, with and without regional priors. We also propose novel techniques to incorporate image and region isolation using human segmentation and Hungarian matching, significantly improving ID similarity. Our proposed benchmark and key findings provide valuable insights and a standardized tool for advancing research in multi-human image generation. The dataset and evaluation codes will be available at https://github.com/Qualcomm-AI-research/MultiHuman-Testbench.

Abstract: We introduce the Aging Multiverse, a framework for generating multiple plausible facial aging trajectories from a single image, each conditioned on external factors such as environment, health, and lifestyle. Unlike prior methods that model aging as a single deterministic path, our approach creates an aging tree that visualizes diverse futures. To enable this, we propose a training-free diffusion-based method that balances identity preservation, age accuracy, and condition control. Our key contributions include attention mixing to modulate editing strength and a Simulated Aging Regularization strategy to stabilize edits. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across identity preservation, aging realism, and conditional alignment, outperforming existing editing and age-progression models, which often fail to account for one or more of the editing criteria. By transforming aging into a multi-dimensional, controllable, and interpretable process, our approach opens up new creative and practical avenues in digital storytelling, health education, and personalized visualization.

Abstract: Generating high-quality novel views of a scene from a single image requires maintaining structural coherence across different views, referred to as view consistency. While diffusion models have driven advancements in novel view synthesis, they still struggle to preserve spatial continuity across views. Diffusion models have been combined with 3D models to address the issue, but such approaches lack efficiency due to their complex multi-step pipelines. This paper proposes a novel view-consistent image generation method which utilizes diffusion models without additional modules. Our key idea is to enhance diffusion models with a training-free method that enables adaptive attention manipulation and noise reinitialization by leveraging view-guided warping to ensure view consistency. Through our comprehensive metric framework suitable for novel-view datasets, we show that our method improves view consistency across various diffusion models, demonstrating its broader applicability.

Abstract: Short-video misinformation detection has attracted wide attention in the multi-modal domain, aiming to accurately identify the misinformation in the video format accompanied by the corresponding audio. Despite significant advancements, current models in this field, trained on particular domains (source domains), often exhibit unsatisfactory performance on unseen domains (target domains) due to domain gaps. To effectively realize such domain generalization on the short-video misinformation detection task, we propose deep insights into the characteristics of different domains: (1) The detection on various domains may mainly rely on different modalities (i.e., mainly focusing on videos or audios). To enhance domain generalization, it is crucial to achieve optimal model performance on all modalities simultaneously. (2) For some domains focusing on cross-modal joint fraud, a comprehensive analysis relying on cross-modal fusion is necessary. However, domain biases located in each modality (especially in each frame of videos) will be accumulated in this fusion process, which may seriously damage the final identification of misinformation. To address these issues, we propose a new DOmain generalization model via ConsisTency and invariance learning for shORt-video misinformation detection (named DOCTOR), which contains two characteristic modules: (1) We involve the cross-modal feature interpolation to map multiple modalities into a shared space and the interpolation distillation to synchronize multi-modal learning; (2) We design the diffusion model to add noise to retain core features of multi modal and enhance domain invariant features through cross-modal guided denoising. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DOCTOR model. Our code is public available at https://github.com/ghh1125/DOCTOR.

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However, current VLA models suffer from two drawbacks: (i) generation of massive tokens leading to high inference latency and increased training cost, and (ii) insufficient utilization of generated actions resulting in potential performance loss. To address these issues, we develop a training framework to finetune VLA models for generating significantly fewer action tokens with high parallelism, effectively reducing inference latency and training cost. Furthermore, we introduce an inference optimization technique with a novel voting-based ensemble strategy to combine current and previous action predictions, improving the utilization of generated actions and overall performance. Our results demonstrate that we achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, achieving significantly higher success rates and 39$\times$ faster inference than OpenVLA with 46 Hz throughput on edge platforms, demonstrating practical deployability.

Abstract: As a challenging vision-language (VL) task, Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. Although many existing CIR methods have attained promising performance, their reliance on costly, manually labeled triplets hinders scalability and zero-shot capability. To address this issue, we propose a scalable pipeline for automatic triplet generation, along with a fully synthetic dataset named Composed Image Retrieval on High-quality Synthetic Triplets (CIRHS). Our pipeline leverages a large language model (LLM) to generate diverse prompts, controlling a text-to-image generative model to produce image pairs with identical elements in each pair, which are then filtered and reorganized to form the CIRHS dataset. In addition, we introduce Hybrid Contextual Alignment (CoAlign), a novel CIR framework, which can accomplish global alignment and local reasoning within a broader context, enabling the model to learn more robust and informative representations. By utilizing the synthetic CIRHS dataset, CoAlign achieves outstanding zero-shot performance on three commonly used benchmarks, demonstrating for the first time the feasibility of training CIR models on a fully synthetic dataset. Furthermore, under supervised training, our method outperforms all the state-of-the-art supervised CIR approaches, validating the effectiveness of our proposed retrieval framework. The code and the CIRHS dataset will be released soon.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models have exhibited remarkable abilities in detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. However, some challenging OOD samples, which lie close to in-distribution (InD) data in image feature space, can still lead to misclassification. The emergence of foundation models like diffusion models and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offers a potential solution to this issue. In this work, we propose SynOOD, a novel approach that harnesses foundation models to generate synthetic, challenging OOD data for fine-tuning CLIP models, thereby enhancing boundary-level discrimination between InD and OOD samples. Our method uses an iterative in-painting process guided by contextual prompts from MLLMs to produce nuanced, boundary-aligned OOD samples. These samples are refined through noise adjustments based on gradients from OOD scores like the energy score, effectively sampling from the InD/OOD boundary. With these carefully synthesized images, we fine-tune the CLIP image encoder and negative label features derived from the text encoder to strengthen connections between near-boundary OOD samples and a set of negative labels. Finally, SynOOD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale ImageNet benchmark, with minimal increases in parameters and runtime. Our approach significantly surpasses existing methods, and the code is available at https://github.com/Jarvisgivemeasuit/SynOOD.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language backbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new tasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and answers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language datasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the demonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on textual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal adaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its practical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the improved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual context. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably evaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues, we first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by rebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present TrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that explicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly visual content-for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements in the true multimodal in-context learning capabilities.

Abstract: Motion forecasting and planning are tasked with estimating the trajectories of traffic agents and the ego vehicle, respectively, to ensure the safety and efficiency of autonomous driving systems in dynamically changing environments. State-of-the-art methods typically adopt a one-query-one-trajectory paradigm, where each query corresponds to a unique trajectory for predicting multi-mode trajectories. While this paradigm can produce diverse motion intentions, it often falls short in modeling the intricate spatiotemporal evolution of trajectories, which can lead to collisions or suboptimal outcomes. To overcome this limitation, we propose DeMo++, a framework that decouples motion estimation into two distinct components: holistic motion intentions to capture the diverse potential directions of movement, and fine spatiotemporal states to track the agent's dynamic progress within the scene and enable a self-refinement capability. Further, we introduce a cross-scene trajectory interaction mechanism to explore the relationships between motions in adjacent scenes. This allows DeMo++ to comprehensively model both the diversity of motion intentions and the spatiotemporal evolution of each trajectory. To effectively implement this framework, we developed a hybrid model combining Attention and Mamba. This architecture leverages the strengths of both mechanisms for efficient scene information aggregation and precise trajectory state sequence modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeMo++ achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks, including motion forecasting (Argoverse 2 and nuScenes), motion planning (nuPlan), and end-to-end planning (NAVSIM).

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for multimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness. Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts (DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer (MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS 2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy, interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing modality scenarios at test time.

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$ contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models (MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples. Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements, demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical chart editing systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a pose-free, feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework designed to handle unfavorable input views. A common rendering setup for training feed-forward approaches places a 3D object at the world origin and renders it from cameras pointed toward the origin -- i.e., from favorable views, limiting the applicability of these models to real-world scenarios involving varying and unknown camera poses. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel adaptation framework that enables pretrained pose-free feed-forward 3DGS models to handle unfavorable views. We leverage priors learned from favorable images by feeding recentered images into a pretrained model augmented with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers. We further propose a Gaussian adapter module to enhance the geometric consistency of the Gaussians derived from the recentered inputs, along with a Gaussian alignment method to render accurate target views for training. Additionally, we introduce a new training strategy that utilizes an off-the-shelf dataset composed solely of favorable images. Experimental results on both synthetic images from the Google Scanned Objects dataset and real images from the OmniObject3D dataset validate the effectiveness of our method in handling unfavorable input views.

Abstract: Early Exit Neural Networks (EENNs) endow astandard Deep Neural Network (DNN) with Early Exit Classifiers (EECs), to provide predictions at intermediate points of the processing when enough confidence in classification is achieved. This leads to many benefits in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Currently, the design of EENNs is carried out manually by experts, a complex and time-consuming task that requires accounting for many aspects, including the correct placement, the thresholding, and the computational overhead of the EECs. For this reason, the research is exploring the use of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automatize the design of EENNs. Currently, few comprehensive NAS solutions for EENNs have been proposed in the literature, and a fully automated, joint design strategy taking into consideration both the backbone and the EECs remains an open problem. To this end, this work presents Neural Architecture Search for Hardware Constrained Early Exit Neural Networks (NACHOS), the first NAS framework for the design of optimal EENNs satisfying constraints on the accuracy and the number of Multiply and Accumulate (MAC) operations performed by the EENNs at inference time. In particular, this provides the joint design of backbone and EECs to select a set of admissible (i.e., respecting the constraints) Pareto Optimal Solutions in terms of best tradeoff between the accuracy and number of MACs. The results show that the models designed by NACHOS are competitive with the state-of-the-art EENNs. Additionally, this work investigates the effectiveness of two novel regularization terms designed for the optimization of the auxiliary classifiers of the EENN

Abstract: Model Inversion (MI) attacks pose a significant privacy threat by reconstructing private training data from machine learning models. While existing defenses primarily concentrate on model-centric approaches, the impact of data on MI robustness remains largely unexplored. In this work, we explore Random Erasing (RE), a technique traditionally used for improving model generalization under occlusion, and uncover its surprising effectiveness as a defense against MI attacks. Specifically, our novel feature space analysis shows that models trained with RE-images introduce a significant discrepancy between the features of MI-reconstructed images and those of the private data. At the same time, features of private images remain distinct from other classes and well-separated from different classification regions. These effects collectively degrade MI reconstruction quality and attack accuracy while maintaining reasonable natural accuracy. Furthermore, we explore two critical properties of RE including Partial Erasure and Random Location. Partial Erasure prevents the model from observing entire objects during training. We find this has a significant impact on MI, which aims to reconstruct the entire objects. Random Location of erasure plays a crucial role in achieving a strong privacy-utility trade-off. Our findings highlight RE as a simple yet effective defense mechanism that can be easily integrated with existing privacy-preserving techniques. Extensive experiments across 37 setups demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in the privacy-utility trade-off. The results consistently demonstrate the superiority of our defense over existing methods across different MI attacks, network architectures, and attack configurations. For the first time, we achieve a significant degradation in attack accuracy without a decrease in utility for some configurations.

Abstract: Recent advances in parameter-efficient transfer learning have demonstrated the utility of composing LoRA adapters from libraries of pretrained modules. However, most existing approaches rely on simple retrieval heuristics or uniform averaging, which overlook the latent structure of task relationships in representation space. We propose a new framework for adapter reuse that moves beyond retrieval, formulating adapter composition as a geometry-aware sparse reconstruction problem. Specifically, we represent each task by a latent prototype vector derived from the base model's encoder and aim to approximate the target task prototype as a sparse linear combination of retrieved reference prototypes, under an $\ell_1$-regularized optimization objective. The resulting combination weights are then used to blend the corresponding LoRA adapters, yielding a composite adapter tailored to the target task. This formulation not only preserves the local geometric structure of the task representation manifold, but also promotes interpretability and efficient reuse by selecting a minimal set of relevant adapters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple domains-including medical image segmentation, medical report generation and image synthesis. Our results highlight the benefit of coupling retrieval with latent geometry-aware optimization for improved zero-shot generalization.

Abstract: We developed a rapid scanning optical microscope, termed "BlurryScope", that leverages continuous image acquisition and deep learning to provide a cost-effective and compact solution for automated inspection and analysis of tissue sections. This device offers comparable speed to commercial digital pathology scanners, but at a significantly lower price point and smaller size/weight. Using BlurryScope, we implemented automated classification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) scores on motion-blurred images of immunohistochemically (IHC) stained breast tissue sections, achieving concordant results with those obtained from a high-end digital scanning microscope. Using a test set of 284 unique patient cores, we achieved testing accuracies of 79.3% and 89.7% for 4-class (0, 1+, 2+, 3+) and 2-class (0/1+, 2+/3+) HER2 classification, respectively. BlurryScope automates the entire workflow, from image scanning to stitching and cropping, as well as HER2 score classification.

Abstract: Off-road environments remain significant challenges for autonomous ground vehicles, due to the lack of structured roads and the presence of complex obstacles, such as uneven terrain, vegetation, and occlusions. Traditional perception algorithms, primarily designed for structured environments, often fail in unstructured scenarios. In this paper, traversable area recognition is achieved through semantic scene completion. A novel multimodal method, 3DTTNet, is proposed to generate dense traversable terrain estimations by integrating LiDAR point clouds with monocular images from a forward-facing perspective. By integrating multimodal data, environmental feature extraction is strengthened, which is crucial for accurate terrain modeling in complex terrains. Furthermore, RELLIS-OCC, a dataset with 3D traversable annotations, is introduced, incorporating geometric features such as step height, slope, and unevenness. Through a comprehensive analysis of vehicle obsta cle-crossing conditions and the incorporation of vehicle body structure constraints, four traversability cost labels are generated: lethal, medium-cost, low-cost, and free. Experimental results demonstrate that 3DTTNet outperforms the comparison approaches in 3D traversable area recognition, particularly in off-road environments with irregular geometries and partial occlusions. Specifically, 3DTTNet achieves a 42\% improvement in scene completion IoU compared to other models. The proposed framework is scalable and adaptable to various vehicle platforms, allowing for adjustments to occupancy grid parameters and the integration of advanced dynamic models for traversability cost estimation.

Abstract: Binaural audio generation (BAG) aims to convert monaural audio to stereo audio using visual prompts, requiring a deep understanding of spatial and semantic information. However, current models risk overfitting to room environments and lose fine-grained spatial details. In this paper, we propose a new audio-visual binaural generation model incorporating an audio-visual conditional normalisation layer that dynamically aligns the mean and variance of the target difference audio features using visual context, along with a new contrastive learning method to enhance spatial sensitivity by mining negative samples from shuffled visual features. We also introduce a cost-efficient way to utilise test-time augmentation in video data to enhance performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art generation accuracy on the FAIR-Play and MUSIC-Stereo benchmarks.

<title>Probabilistic Modeling of Jailbreak on Multimodal LLMs: From Quantification to Application</title>

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated their superior ability in understanding multimodal content. However, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which exploit weaknesses in their safety alignment to generate harmful responses. Previous studies categorize jailbreaks as successful or failed based on whether responses contain malicious content. However, given the stochastic nature of MLLM responses, this binary classification of an input's ability to jailbreak MLLMs is inappropriate. Derived from this viewpoint, we introduce jailbreak probability to quantify the jailbreak potential of an input, which represents the likelihood that MLLMs generated a malicious response when prompted with this input. We approximate this probability through multiple queries to MLLMs. After modeling the relationship between input hidden states and their corresponding jailbreak probability using Jailbreak Probability Prediction Network (JPPN), we use continuous jailbreak probability for optimization. Specifically, we propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Attack (JPA) that optimizes adversarial perturbations on input image to maximize jailbreak probability, and further enhance it as Multimodal JPA (MJPA) by including monotonic text rephrasing. To counteract attacks, we also propose Jailbreak-Probability-based Finetuning (JPF), which minimizes jailbreak probability through MLLM parameter updates. Extensive experiments show that (1) (M)JPA yields significant improvements when attacking a wide range of models under both white and black box settings. (2) JPF vastly reduces jailbreaks by at most over 60\%. Both of the above results demonstrate the significance of introducing jailbreak probability to make nuanced distinctions among input jailbreak abilities.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in visual reasoning, yet come with substantial computational cost, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained settings. Despite recent effort on improving the efficiency of MLLMs, prior solutions fall short in responding to varying runtime conditions, in particular changing resource availability (e.g., contention due to the execution of other programs on the device). To bridge this gap, we introduce AdaLLaVA, an adaptive inference framework that learns to dynamically reconfigure operations in an MLLM during inference, accounting for the input data and a latency budget. We conduct extensive experiments across benchmarks involving question-answering, reasoning, and hallucination. Our results show that AdaLLaVA effectively adheres to input latency budget, achieving varying accuracy and latency tradeoffs at runtime. Further, we demonstrate that AdaLLaVA adapts to both input latency and content, can be integrated with token selection for enhanced efficiency, and generalizes across MLLMs. Our project webpage with code release is at https://zhuoyan-xu.github.io/ada-llava/.

Abstract: We propose VISO-Grasp, a novel vision-language-informed system designed to systematically address visibility constraints for grasping in severely occluded environments. By leveraging Foundation Models (FMs) for spatial reasoning and active view planning, our framework constructs and updates an instance-centric representation of spatial relationships, enhancing grasp success under challenging occlusions. Furthermore, this representation facilitates active Next-Best-View (NBV) planning and optimizes sequential grasping strategies when direct grasping is infeasible. Additionally, we introduce a multi-view uncertainty-driven grasp fusion mechanism that refines grasp confidence and directional uncertainty in real-time, ensuring robust and stable grasp execution. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that VISO-Grasp achieves a success rate of $87.5\%$ in target-oriented grasping with the fewest grasp attempts outperforming baselines. To the best of our knowledge, VISO-Grasp is the first unified framework integrating FMs into target-aware active view planning and 6-DoF grasping in environments with severe occlusions and entire invisibility constraints.

Abstract: Efficient and reliable operation of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants is essential for meeting the growing demand for sustainable energy. However, high-temperature solar receivers face severe operational risks, such as freezing, deformation, and corrosion, resulting in costly downtime and maintenance. To monitor CSP plants, cameras mounted on solar receivers record infrared images at irregular intervals ranging from one to five minutes throughout the day. Anomalous images can be detected by thresholding an anomaly score, where the threshold is chosen to optimize metrics such as the F1-score on a validation set. This work proposes a framework, using risk control, for generating more reliable decision thresholds with finite-sample coverage guarantees on any chosen risk function. Our framework also incorporates an abstention mechanism, allowing high-risk predictions to be deferred to domain experts. Second, we propose a density forecasting method to estimate the likelihood of an observed image given a sequence of previously observed images, using this likelihood as its anomaly score. Third, we analyze the deployment results of our framework across multiple training scenarios over several months for two CSP plants. This analysis provides valuable insights to our industry partner for optimizing maintenance operations. Finally, given the confidential nature of our dataset, we provide an extended simulated dataset, leveraging recent advancements in generative modeling to create diverse thermal images that simulate multiple CSP plants. Our code is publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-based weather forecasting models, such as FourCastNet, Pangu-Weather, and GraphCast, have demonstrated the remarkable ability of deep learning to emulate complex atmospheric dynamics. Building on this momentum, we propose Mj\"olnir, a novel deep learning-based framework for global lightning flash density parameterization. Trained on ERA5 atmospheric predictors and World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) observations at a daily temporal resolution and 1 degree spatial resolution, Mj\"olnir captures the nonlinear mapping between large-scale environmental conditions and lightning activity. The model architecture is based on the InceptionNeXt backbone with SENet, and a multi-task learning strategy to simultaneously predict lightning occurrence and magnitude. Extensive evaluations yield that Mollnir accurately reproduces the global distribution, seasonal variability, and regional characteristics of lightning activity, achieving a global Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 for annual mean fields. These results suggest that Mj\"olnir serves not only as an effective data-driven global lightning parameterization but also as a promising AI-based scheme for next-generation Earth system models (AI-ESMs).

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) seeks to localize the anomaly mask of an input image with respect to normal samples. Either by reconstructing normal counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples, comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network, guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for both single- and multi-class UAD tasks. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD.

Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge. Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion (GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days. In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally efficient long-range weather prediction.

However, existing static, non-interactive evaluation paradigms fail to adequately assess risks within these interactive environments, since they cannot simulate dynamic risks that emerge from an agent's actions and rely on unreliable post-hoc evaluations that ignore unsafe intermediate steps. To bridge this critical gap, we propose evaluating an agent's interactive safety: its ability to perceive emergent risks and execute mitigation steps in the correct procedural order. We thus present IS-Bench, the first multi-modal benchmark designed for interactive safety, featuring 161 challenging scenarios with 388 unique safety risks instantiated in a high-fidelity simulator. Crucially, it facilitates a novel process-oriented evaluation that verifies whether risk mitigation actions are performed before/after specific risk-prone steps. Extensive experiments on leading VLMs, including the GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5 series, reveal that current agents lack interactive safety awareness, and that while safety-aware Chain-of-Thought can improve performance, it often compromises task completion. By highlighting these critical limitations, IS-Bench provides a foundation for developing safer and more reliable embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Field (NeRF)-based segmentation methods focus on object semantics and rely solely on RGB data, lacking intrinsic material properties. This limitation restricts accurate material perception, which is crucial for robotics, augmented reality, simulation, and other applications. We introduce UnMix-NeRF, a framework that integrates spectral unmixing into NeRF, enabling joint hyperspectral novel view synthesis and unsupervised material segmentation. Our method models spectral reflectance via diffuse and specular components, where a learned dictionary of global endmembers represents pure material signatures, and per-point abundances capture their distribution. For material segmentation, we use spectral signature predictions along learned endmembers, allowing unsupervised material clustering. Additionally, UnMix-NeRF enables scene editing by modifying learned endmember dictionaries for flexible material-based appearance manipulation. Extensive experiments validate our approach, demonstrating superior spectral reconstruction and material segmentation to existing methods. Project page: https://www.factral.co/UnMix-NeRF.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a promising approach for automatically designing neural network architectures. However, the architecture estimation of NAS is computationally expensive and time-consuming because of training multiple architectures from scratch. Although existing zero-shot NAS methods use training-free proxies to accelerate the architecture estimation, their effectiveness, stability, and generality are still lacking. We present a novel training-free estimation proxy called weighted response correlation (WRCor). WRCor utilizes correlation coefficient matrices of responses across different input samples to calculate the proxy scores of estimated architectures, which can measure their expressivity and generalizability. Experimental results on proxy evaluation demonstrate that WRCor and its voting proxies are more efficient estimation strategies than existing proxies. We also apply them with different search strategies in architecture search. Experimental results on architecture search show that our zero-shot NAS algorithm outperforms most existing NAS algorithms in different search spaces. Our NAS algorithm can discover an architecture with a 22.1% test error on the ImageNet-1k dataset within 4 GPU hours. All codes are publicly available at https://github.com/kunjing96/ZSNAS-WRCor.git.

Abstract: Confounders are extraneous variables that affect both the input and the target, resulting in spurious correlations and biased predictions. There are recent advances in dealing with or removing confounders in traditional models, such as metadata normalization (MDN), where the distribution of the learned features is adjusted based on the study confounders. However, in the context of continual learning, where a model learns continuously from new data over time without forgetting, learning feature representations that are invariant to confounders remains a significant challenge. To remove their influence from intermediate feature representations, we introduce the Recursive MDN (R-MDN) layer, which can be integrated into any deep learning architecture, including vision transformers, and at any model stage. R-MDN performs statistical regression via the recursive least squares algorithm to maintain and continually update an internal model state with respect to changing distributions of data and confounding variables. Our experiments demonstrate that R-MDN promotes equitable predictions across population groups, both within static learning and across different stages of continual learning, by reducing catastrophic forgetting caused by confounder effects changing over time.

Abstract: Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) have become one of the fundamental architectural component in point cloud analysis due to its effective feature learning mechanism. However, when processing complex geometric structures in point clouds, MLPs' fixed activation functions struggle to efficiently capture local geometric features, while suffering from poor parameter efficiency and high model redundancy. In this paper, we propose PointKAN, which applies Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to point cloud analysis tasks to investigate their efficacy in hierarchical feature representation. First, we introduce a Geometric Affine Module (GAM) to transform local features, improving the model's robustness to geometric variations. Next, in the Local Feature Processing (LFP), a parallel structure extracts both group-level features and global context, providing a rich representation of both fine details and overall structure. Finally, these features are combined and processed in the Global Feature Processing (GFP). By repeating these operations, the receptive field gradually expands, enabling the model to capture complete geometric information of the point cloud. To overcome the high parameter counts and computational inefficiency of standard KANs, we develop Efficient-KANs in the PointKAN-elite variant, which significantly reduces parameters while maintaining accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that PointKAN outperforms PointMLP on benchmark datasets such as ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and ShapeNetPart, with particularly strong performance in Few-shot Learning task. Additionally, PointKAN achieves substantial reductions in parameter counts and computational complexity (FLOPs). This work highlights the potential of KANs-based architectures in 3D vision and opens new avenues for research in point cloud understanding.

Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars, where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets, yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability. Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image, leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer learning performance.

Summary: 
The paper introduces MoCHA, a novel visual framework that integrates four vision backbones and a sparse Mixture of Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to effectively handle complex visual information. MoCHA also employs a Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) mechanism with intra- and inter-group operations to refine visual features and an adaptive gating strategy for feature selection. Training MoCHA on mainstream Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B shows superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models like CuMo (Mistral-7B) in tasks like mitigating hallucination and following visual instructions. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the MoECs and HGA components in enhancing MoCHA's overall performance. The proposed framework demonstrates advancements in bridging modalities and extracting visual details efficiently. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Vision large language models (VLLMs) are focusing primarily on handling complex and fine-grained visual information by incorporating advanced vision encoders and scaling up visual models. However, these approaches face high training and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual details, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a novel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework integrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to extract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of Experts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to different visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the visual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a Hierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and an adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two mainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance across various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art open-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo (Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate hallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual instructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in improving the overall performance of MoCHA.

Summary:
DreamVVT introduces a two-stage framework utilizing Diffusion Transformers to enhance VVT technology. By leveraging unpaired human-centric data, the model improves adaptability in real-world scenarios. The first stage generates keyframe try-on images using a vision-language model and pretrained models, providing appearance guidance for video generation. In the second stage, skeleton maps, motion, and appearance descriptions are used along with keyframe images in a pretrained video generation model with LoRA adapters for long-term temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate DreamVVT's superiority in preserving fine garment details and temporal stability in unconstrained scenarios. <div>
arXiv:2508.02807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic interest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and entertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images. These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content and temporal stability in real-world scenarios.

<div> Keywords: IJEPA, feature normalization, DynTanh activation, ImageNet, self-supervised learning

Summary:
IJEPA is a common architecture for visual representation learning but suffers from issues related to feature normalization. Feature normalization in IJEPA disrupts the natural energy hierarchy of visual tokens, leading to checkerboard artifacts in loss maps. The proposed solution is to replace feature normalization with DynTanh activation, which preserves token energies and allows semantically rich regions to be prioritized. This modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy and reduces RMSE in depth estimation tasks. The results indicate that preserving natural token energies is crucial for effective self-supervised visual representation learning. <div>
arXiv:2508.02829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard image joint embedding predictive architecture (IJEPA), features at the output of the teacher encoder are layer normalized (LN) before serving as a distillation target for the student encoder and predictor. We propose that this feature normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy of visual tokens, where high-energy tokens (those with larger L2 norms) encode semantically important image regions. LN forces all features to have identical L2 norms, effectively equalizing their energies and preventing the model from prioritizing semantically rich regions. We find that IJEPA models trained with feature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We propose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter better preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater contribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature DynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard artifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for ViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation. These results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for effective self-supervised visual representation learning.

GENIE uses trainable feature embeddings for Gaussian primitives, allowing for efficient conditioning of the NeRF network. The model also introduces Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search for fast nearest Gaussian search and a multi-resolution hash grid for initializing and updating Gaussian features. This approach enables real-time, locality-aware editing, where changes to Gaussian primitives immediately impact the rendered output. By merging implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene manipulation, dynamic interaction, and integration with physical simulation, bridging the gap between traditional editing methods and neural rendering. The code for GENIE is available on GitHub for further exploration and development. <div>
arXiv:2508.02831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently transformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features. Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation, bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering.

A new approach for medical image segmentation using coarse-level annotations is proposed.

By training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, the network can infer precise segmentation labels.

This demonstrates the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach in generating high-quality pixel-level annotations for medical images.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.02844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality pixel-level annotations of medical images are essential for supervised segmentation tasks, but obtaining such annotations is costly and requires medical expertise. To address this challenge, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that relies entirely on coarse-level annotations, encompassing both target and complementary drawings, despite their inherent noise. The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order to model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By jointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively refines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution, achieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based modeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, we demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and MSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset. Experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods and closely matches the fully supervised approach.

MIDAR utilizes a Refined Multi-hop Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph to capture occlusion relationships among vehicles and employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP architecture for feature propagation.

arXiv:2508.02858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives (TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position, speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will be open-sourced upon publication.

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers, we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such, it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper, we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity. Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction methodologies and detection algorithms.

Abstract: This paper introduces VisuCraft, a novel framework designed to significantly enhance the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex visual-guided creative content generation. Existing LVLMs often exhibit limitations in maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and precise adherence to nuanced user instructions when generating long-form texts. VisuCraft addresses these challenges by integrating a multimodal structured information extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G). The extractor distills fine-grained visual attributes from input images into a rich, structured representation, which the dynamic prompt module then combines with user instructions to create highly optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs (e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP). Evaluated on the self-constructed ImageStoryGen-500K dataset using VisuGen Metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity, and Instruction Adherence), VisuCraft consistently outperforms baseline LVLMs across tasks like story generation and poetry composition. Our results demonstrate remarkable improvements, particularly in creativity and instruction adherence, validating VisuCraft's effectiveness in producing imaginative, visually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text. This work unlocks new potential for LVLMs in sophisticated creative AI applications.

<div> Keywords: Diffusion models, Anomaly segmentation, Robust denoising, Unsupervised learning, Maximum likelihood estimation

Summary:<br />
Recent advancements in diffusion models have shown promise in unsupervised anomaly segmentation, where the models are trained on normal data and used to segment anomalies. However, these models typically require access to normal data for training, limiting their practicality. This paper introduces robust denoising diffusion models that can handle scenarios where only contaminated unlabeled data is available. By framing maximum likelihood estimation as a nonlinear regression problem, the authors reinterpret the denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens and derive robust versions of these models using robust regression techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing diffusion-based methods in unsupervised anomaly segmentation tasks, achieving higher AUROC and AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The code implementation is provided on GitHub for further validation and use.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\% higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets.

Summary: 
The study introduces the concept of material-controlled acoustic profile generation, aiming to generate a target acoustic profile based on specific material configurations in an indoor scene. They propose an encoder-decoder model that encodes scene properties from audio-visual observations and generates Room Impulse Responses (RIRs) based on user-defined material specifications. A new benchmark dataset, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, is developed to support the task.

Abstract: How would the sound in a studio change with a carpeted floor and acoustic tiles on the walls? We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic profile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual characteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a user-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task with a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties from an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response (RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our model enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material configurations defined dynamically at inference time. To support this task, we create a new benchmark, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, designed for developing and evaluating material-aware RIR prediction methods under diverse and challenging settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively encodes material information and generates high-fidelity RIRs, outperforming several baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

Summary:
The paper explores the use of off-the-shelf LVLMs for Vision-and-Language Navigation tasks, specifically examining their performance in both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. The study fine-tunes the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model on the R2R dataset and evaluates its success rate, finding that while off-the-shelf LVLMs can be adapted for VLN tasks, they still fall short compared to models specifically designed for navigation. The best-performing model achieves a 41% success rate on the R2R test set, indicating that further optimization is needed to fully leverage the potential of LVLMs in VLN tasks. <div>

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41% success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind models specifically designed for this task.

<div> Keywords: Maximum A Posteriori, blind deconvolution, diffusion-based priors, local minimizers, numerical experiments

Summary: 
The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is commonly used in blind deconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. However, when combined with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP estimation tends to favor blurry solutions. In this study, the authors revisit this issue using diffusion-based priors, which better capture realistic image distributions. Through empirical analysis, they find that blurry images have higher likelihoods in the prior's landscape, but there are also local minimizers corresponding to natural images. The theoretical analysis reveals that MAP estimation tends to produce sharp filters and blurry solutions. However, utilizing gradient descent to find local minimizers can lead to realistic image solutions. The study emphasizes the importance of good local initialization for overcoming MAP's limitations. Numerical experiments validate the findings and suggest practical implications for improving priors and optimization techniques. 

<br /><br />Summary: The Maximum A Posteriori estimation in blind deconvolution often favors blurry solutions when utilizing sparsity-promoting priors. Diffusion-based priors offer a more realistic image distribution model, revealing a landscape with both blurry images and natural image local minimizers. The study highlights that MAP estimation tends to produce sharp filters and blurriness but utilizing gradient descent to find local minimizers can lead to realistic image solutions. Overcoming MAP's limitations requires good local initialization for reaching local minima in the posterior landscape. Numerical experiments support these findings and suggest implications for enhancing priors and optimization methods. <div>

Abstract: The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is a widely used framework in blind deconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. The estimated image and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior distribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP estimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its effectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based priors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through an empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two key properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second, the landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural images. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the blind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to produce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions. However local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient descent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind deconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations requires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape. We validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the practical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and optimization techniques.

Summary:
This study examines the impact of ImageNet pretraining on small backbone architectures (ultra-small models with <1M parameters) for object detection tasks in the infrared visual modality. The research investigates the performance of two ultra-small backbone families under different conditions and datasets. Results show that pre-training is beneficial for small models, but its effectiveness diminishes beyond a certain capacity threshold. While pre-training is recommended, using extremely small models may compromise robustness in out-of-distribution detection scenarios. Practitioners are advised to balance model size with performance requirements to avoid brittleness in varied working conditions. <div>
arXiv:2508.02927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models, pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working conditions are different.

<div> Framework, Animation, Audio-driven, Portrait, Emotion <br />
Summary: 

X-Actor introduces a novel audio-driven portrait animation framework that creates realistic talking head videos based on a single image and audio input. This framework differs from previous methods by focusing on capturing nuanced emotions that align with speech content and rhythm, rather than just lip synchronization. The approach involves a two-stage process: an autoregressive diffusion model generates facial motion tokens based on the audio input, and a video synthesis module translates these motions into high-quality animations. By decoupling visual and identity cues, the model effectively predicts long-range facial dynamics without error accumulation. X-Actor produces cinematic-style performances that surpass standard talking head animations and sets a new benchmark in long-range, emotionally expressive portrait acting. <div>
arXiv:2508.02944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present X-Actor, a novel audio-driven portrait animation framework that generates lifelike, emotionally expressive talking head videos from a single reference image and an input audio clip. Unlike prior methods that emphasize lip synchronization and short-range visual fidelity in constrained speaking scenarios, X-Actor enables actor-quality, long-form portrait performance capturing nuanced, dynamically evolving emotions that flow coherently with the rhythm and content of speech. Central to our approach is a two-stage decoupled generation pipeline: an audio-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model that predicts expressive yet identity-agnostic facial motion latent tokens within a long temporal context window, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis module that translates these motions into high-fidelity video animations. By operating in a compact facial motion latent space decoupled from visual and identity cues, our autoregressive diffusion model effectively captures long-range correlations between audio and facial dynamics through a diffusion-forcing training paradigm, enabling infinite-length emotionally-rich motion prediction without error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-Actor produces compelling, cinematic-style performances that go beyond standard talking head animations and achieves state-of-the-art results in long-range, audio-driven emotional portrait acting.

Summary:
In this work, the focus is on improving image denoising models' ability to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions with spatially variant noise. The researchers propose incorporating scale-equivariant structures as a core inductive bias to enhance OOD robustness. Their framework includes a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM) to stabilize feature distributions and correct features under varying noise intensities and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM) for effective information modulation. The model consistently outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world benchmarks, particularly under spatially heterogeneous noise. This research sheds light on the importance of scale equivariance in improving denoising models' performance in diverse noise conditions. The code for the framework will be publicly available for further exploration and development.

arXiv:2508.02967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially variant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored challenge. In this work, we investigate \emph{scale equivariance} as a core inductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating scale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on spatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations. Building on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework equipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM) and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions and dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM facilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between signal and feature paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, especially under spatially heterogeneous noise. Code will be made publicly available.

Summary: 
Diffusion models have shown great potential in creating detailed images from text prompts, but prompt adherence and quality can vary. A method called negative prompting aims to improve prompt compliance by specifying what should not be included in the image. This study explores the combination of negative prompting and classifier-free guidance to develop a technique called Adaptive Negative Sampling Without External Resources (ANSWER). ANSWER leverages the model's internal understanding of negation to improve image fidelity to the prompt without requiring additional training. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating ANSWER into existing diffusion models outperforms baseline methods on various benchmarks and is preferred by human evaluators. <div>
arXiv:2508.02973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create diverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also well-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality. Negative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying what an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\it Adaptive Negative Sampling Without External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique, applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the other methods.

Analysis of the dimensions of LoRA weights is also conducted to understand their impact on the learning process. Overall, the proposed method offers a new perspective on multi-domain learning architectures, highlighting the importance of optimizing adapter placement for improved performance. <br /> <div>

The paper introduces the Attention-Focused Offensive Gradient (AFOG) attack, a neural-architecture agnostic method that effectively targets both large transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors. AFOG incorporates a learnable attention mechanism to focus perturbations on vulnerable image regions, improving performance by up to 30.6% compared to non-attention baselines.

AFOG is efficient and stealthy, capable of causing well-trained object detection models to fail with visually imperceptible perturbations. Extensive experiments on COCO dataset demonstrate AFOG's efficacy, outperforming existing attacks on both transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to 83% in terms of speed and imperceptibility.

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks, increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second, AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to 83% with superior speed and imperceptibility.

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models enable high-quality image generation but also pose significant risks of misuse, particularly in producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content. While prior detection methods have focused on filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.

arXiv:2508.03007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to improve the generalization ability of models across unseen domains without access to target data during training. Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies. However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning, while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability. Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic segmentation task of domain generalization.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal Large Language Models, video understanding, SceneQA, LVSQA dataset, SLFG

Summary:
The paper introduces a new scenario called SceneQA for improving long video understanding by emphasizing scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. A new dataset, LVSQA, is developed to support this task and consists of question-answer pairs for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models. The proposed SLFG method aims to enhance understanding capabilities by combining individual frames into semantically coherent scene frames. SLFG utilizes scene localization methods and dynamic frame reassembly mechanisms without requiring modifications to existing model architectures.

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG. The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability. Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at http://www.slfg.pkuzwh.cn.

<div> Keywords: 3D Gaussian Splatting, scene representation, compression, rendering quality, pruning

Summary: 
The article introduces a new method, SA-3DGS, to address the storage demands and practical deployment limitations of 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis. SA-3DGS learns importance scores to identify insignificant Gaussian points, enabling effective pruning and compression. The importance-aware clustering module compresses Gaussians attributes accurately into a codebook, improving expressive capability while reducing model size. The codebook repair module leverages contextual information to recover original Gaussian attributes, mitigating degradation in rendering quality. Experimental results show up to 66x compression with maintained or improved rendering quality. The proposed approach not only adapts to other pruning-based methods but also enhances their performance and generalization ability.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and high-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS, a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering quality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but also improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing excellent performance and strong generalization ability.

Abstract: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals, promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face similarity.

arXiv:2508.03039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and 3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly outperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for cross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through person-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed visual information while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Existing studies on talking video generation have predominantly focused on single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, limiting their applicability to realistic multi-human interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce MIT, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-human talking video generation. To this end, we develop an automatic pipeline that collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos. The resulting dataset comprises 12 hours of high-resolution footage, each featuring two to four speakers, with fine-grained annotations of body poses and speech interactions. It captures natural conversational dynamics in multi-speaker scenario, offering a rich resource for studying interactive visual behaviors. To demonstrate the potential of MIT, we furthur propose CovOG, a baseline model for this novel task. It integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) to handle varying numbers of speakers by aggregating individual pose embeddings, and an Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) to modulate head dynamics based on speaker-specific audio features. Together, these components showcase the feasibility and challenges of generating realistic multi-human talking videos, establishing MIT as a valuable benchmark for future research.

<div> Keywords: Face filters, face matting, occlusions, alpha mattes, real-time applications

Summary:
Face filters are popular in short-form video content but face performance can degrade in the presence of occlusions. A novel task of face matting is introduced to separate occluding elements from facial regions. FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework, is proposed to predict high-quality alpha mattes under complex occlusions. It leverages a two-stage training pipeline with a teacher-student model to improve generalization and preserve semantic consistency. Unlike previous approaches, FaceMat requires no auxiliary inputs, making it suitable for real-time applications. The matting objective is reformulated to clarify compositing strategies by treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background. A new dataset, CelebAMat, specifically designed for occlusion-aware face matting, is introduced. Experimental results show that FaceMat outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing the visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained video scenarios.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However, their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation, we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained video scenarios.

<div> Keywords: Modality-agnostic, Semantic Segmentation, CHARM, Mutual Perception Unit, Dual-path optimization

Summary: 
CHARM is a novel framework for modality-agnostic semantic segmentation that focuses on cooperative harmonization of different input modalities rather than explicit alignment. It includes a Mutual Perception Unit (MPU) for implicit alignment through cross-modal interaction and a dual-path optimization strategy for collaborative learning and individual enhancement. Experiments show that CHARM outperforms existing methods, particularly improving fragile modalities. This approach shifts the focus from homogenization to harmonization, allowing for true cross-modal complementarity and better performance in diverse scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modality-agnostic Semantic Segmentation (MaSS) aims to achieve robust scene understanding across arbitrary combinations of input modality. Existing methods typically rely on explicit feature alignment to achieve modal homogenization, which dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their inherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than homogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework designed to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific advantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling implicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where modalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover modality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy that decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for complementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for protected modality-specific optimization. Experiments across multiple datasets and backbones indicate that CHARM consistently outperform the baselines, with significant increment on the fragile modalities. This work shifts the focus from model homogenization to harmonization, enabling cross-modal complementarity for true harmony in diversity.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage, based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels. A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local information within global features is introduced to enhance learning comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels. Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision, Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution for the UDA in Person ReID.

Summary:
SSFMamba is introduced as a Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network designed for 3D medical image segmentation. The approach utilizes a dual-branch architecture to extract features from both spatial and frequency domains, emphasizing the unique properties of frequency domain information such as conjugate symmetry. The Mamba block is employed to effectively fuse these heterogeneous features, preserving global context while reinforcing local details. A 3D multi-directional scanning mechanism is implemented to enhance the fusion of local and global cues. The frequency domain branch leverages Mamba's ability to extract global contextual information and synergistic effects of frequency domain features, resulting in improved global modeling. Experimental results on BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across various evaluation metrics. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In light of the spatial domain's limited capacity for modeling global context in 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate frequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction strategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain information, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the fundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency domains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths that frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba, a Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D medical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch architecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency domains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to preserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency domain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global contextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency domain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D multi-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and global cues. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various evaluation metrics.

arXiv:2508.03077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes the limitations of optimization-based 3DGS by enabling fast and high-quality reconstruction without the need for per-scene optimization. However, existing feedforward approaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and high-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward 3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views, enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further improving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play manner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across various types of degradations.

Summary:
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), like GPT-4o, are facing scrutiny for fairness concerns in their outputs. While previous studies have mainly focused on demographic attributes, this research explores bias across a wider range of characteristics. By creating a knowledge base of bias attributes using Large Language Models (LLMs), the study assesses LVLM fairness in finer-grained attributes. The findings reveal biased outputs by LVLMs across a variety of attributes, with cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors influencing decisions more than traditional demographics. This highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the biases present in LVLMs and the importance of addressing fairness across multiple dimensions. The study emphasizes the significance of considering a broader range of attributes in evaluating fairness in LVLM outputs.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of applications using Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, has raised significant concerns about their fairness. While existing studies primarily focus on demographic attributes such as race and gender, fairness across a broader range of attributes remains largely unexplored. In this study, we construct an open-set knowledge base of bias attributes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the fairness of LVLMs across finer-grained attributes. Our experimental results reveal that LVLMs exhibit biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes and further demonstrate that cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors have a more pronounced impact on LVLM decision-making than traditional demographic attributes.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces $C^2Aug$, a Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation method for improving the diversity of pseudo-bags in Multiple Instance Learning-based Whole Slide Image classification. By sampling instances from all bags with the same class, $C^2Aug$ increases diversity but also raises the number of critical instances, potentially impacting model performance. To address this, a bag-level and group-level contrastive learning framework is proposed to enhance feature discrimination. Experimental results show that $C^2Aug$ outperforms existing methods in various evaluation metrics. This approach aims to address the issue of constrained diversity in pseudo-bag augmentation methods, particularly in scenarios with small tumor areas on test slides. <div>
arXiv:2508.03081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances, thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

Summary: <br />
Continual learning is crucial for medical image classification systems to adapt to changing clinical environments. Existing approaches integrating multimodal information often lack in-depth semantic information beyond class names. A novel framework proposed in this study leverages visual concepts from large language models to enhance learning. By dynamically creating a visual concept pool and using a filtering mechanism, redundancy is minimized. A cross-modal image-concept attention module, combined with an attention loss, enables the integration of visual concepts into the learning process. This approach results in state-of-the-art performance on medical and natural image datasets, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority. The code will also be made publicly available. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to adapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of multimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image classes. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality information, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name, thereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention module, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can leverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce class-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical and natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We will release the code publicly.

<div> AVATAR, multimodal reasoning, video, spatiotemporal fusion, alignment <br />
Summary: AVATAR introduces a framework for multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video, addressing limitations of existing methods. It utilizes an off-policy training architecture to improve data efficiency and resolve vanishing advantage issues, along with a novel credit assignment strategy called Temporal Advantage Shaping (TAS) that emphasizes critical reasoning steps. The framework outperforms baseline models on various benchmarks such as MMVU, OmniBench, and Video-Holmes by significant margins, demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency. AVATAR's success is attributed to its ability to handle precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities, making it a promising approach for long-horizon video reasoning tasks. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping (TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks, outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and +4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.

<title>Causal Disentanglement and Cross-Modal Alignment for Enhanced Few-Shot Learning</title>

<div> Keywords: Few-shot learning, disentangled representations, CLIP, Causal CLIP Adapter, multimodal contrastive learning

Summary:
The article introduces a new framework called Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA) for few-shot learning, which explicitly disentangles visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component Analysis (ICA). This approach reduces the need to learn the unmixing process from labeled data, leading to fewer trainable parameters and less overfitting. CCA enhances CLIP's cross-modal alignment through fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier and a cross-attention mechanism enriching visual and textual representations. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification outputs are combined linearly for improved accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that CCA outperforms existing methods in few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts while maintaining computational efficiency.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining computational efficiency.

<div> latent fusion, attention-based feature aggregation, 3D reconstruction, multi-view correspondence modeling, hybrid framework

Summary: 
The paper introduces H3R, a hybrid framework that integrates volumetric latent fusion and attention-based feature aggregation to improve generalizable 3D reconstruction, especially in multi-view correspondence modeling. H3R addresses the trade-off between geometric precision and robustness by combining an efficient latent volume enforcing geometric consistency with a camera-aware Transformer for correspondence refinement. This integration enhances generalization and speeds up convergence by 2 times compared to existing methods. The use of spatial-aligned foundation models like SD-VAE is shown to outperform semantic-aligned models like DINOv2, resolving representation mismatches. H3R supports variable-number and high-resolution input views and demonstrates robust cross-dataset generalization. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as RealEstate10K, ACID, and DTU show state-of-the-art performance with significant PSNR improvements.(Source:https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03118v1)

arXiv:2508.03118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting, generalizable 3D reconstruction remains challenging, particularly in multi-view correspondence modeling. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: explicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous regions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow convergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\"ucker coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both paradigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\times$ faster than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that spatial-aligned foundation models (e.g., SD-VAE) substantially outperform semantic-aligned models (e.g., DINOv2), resolving the mismatch between semantic representations and spatial reconstruction requirements. Our method supports variable-number and high-resolution input views while demonstrating robust cross-dataset generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with significant PSNR improvements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on the RealEstate10K, ACID, and DTU datasets, respectively.

<div> Keywords: Vision language models, Landsat imagery, Earth observation, Satellite data, Remote sensing

Summary:<br /><br />Vision language models (VLMs) can revolutionize Earth observation by enabling natural language interaction with satellite imagery. To address the lack of datasets covering long-term, multi-satellite, low-resolution archives like Landsat, the Landsat30-AU dataset was created. It includes image-caption pairs and visual question answering samples from Landsat imagery over Australia spanning 36 years. Evaluation of VLMs showed existing models struggle with satellite imagery understanding. The EarthDial model had low performance, but Qwen2.5-VL-7B showed improvement with fine-tuning on Landsat30-AU data. The open-source code and dataset are available for further research. <div>
arXiv:2508.03127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term, high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components: Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA, comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87.

Summary:
COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast Feature Extractor, is a real-time pose estimation framework designed for asteroids. It leverages sun phase angle information to detect features invariant to the motion of shadows, providing bias-free and accurate pose estimates. By associating salient contours with projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected and matched using a Sparse Neural Network and attention-based Graph Neural Network model. The pipeline is faster and more accurate than existing methods, especially for objects with opaque self-cast shadows like tumbling asteroids. The algorithm is found to be efficient on synthetic data and renderings of the asteroid Apophis, demonstrating its potential for applications such as debris tracking and small body shape estimation in space missions. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical challenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the shape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods, such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates, whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.

Abstract: Fire scene datasets are crucial for training robust computer vision models, particularly in tasks such as fire early warning and emergency rescue operations. However, among the currently available fire-related data, there is a significant shortage of annotated data specifically targeting building units.To tackle this issue, we introduce an annotated dataset of building units captured by drones, which incorporates multiple enhancement techniques. We construct backgrounds using real multi-story scenes, combine motion blur and brightness adjustment to enhance the authenticity of the captured images, simulate drone shooting conditions under various circumstances, and employ large models to generate fire effects at different locations.The synthetic dataset generated by this method encompasses a wide range of building scenarios, with a total of 1,978 images. This dataset can effectively improve the generalization ability of fire unit detection, providing multi-scenario and scalable data while reducing the risks and costs associated with collecting real fire data.

<div> pipeline, unified VLM, image editing, training-free framework, image generation

Summary:
The paper introduces a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I that enables unified Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with image editing capability. The framework follows three iterative steps: understanding, editing, and verifying. It analyzes source images, creates source prompts, and generates target prompts based on editing instructions. Time-adaptive offset is introduced for coherent editing from coarse to fine during the denoising process. The verification step ensures alignment between the target prompt and the edited image, providing consistency scores and corrective feedback. The loop iterates until convergence, delivering high-quality editing. The method is implemented based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark. The proposed pipeline involves freezing the understanding VLM and only training generation-related modules, maintaining the model's capabilities while enabling image generation. The framework shows promising potential for future development in unified VLMs with image editing abilities. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced, effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices, the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image. The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps: understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3. The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop. This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence, delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.

Summary: 
The paper introduces SARD, a novel anomaly synthesis framework that addresses limitations in existing diffusion-based methods. SARD utilizes a Region-Constrained Diffusion process to maintain spatial controllability and fine-grained regional fidelity by selectively updating only anomaly regions during the reverse denoising phase. This approach reduces background artifacts and enhances anomaly realism. The incorporation of a Discriminative Mask Guidance module in the discriminator allows for joint evaluation of both global realism and local anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Experimental results on MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD outperforms existing methods in segmentation accuracy and visual quality, establishing a new state-of-the-art for pixel-level anomaly synthesis. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic and spatially precise anomalies is essential for enhancing the robustness of industrial anomaly detection systems. While recent diffusion-based methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling complex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and fail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts. Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for pixel-level anomaly synthesis.

Summary:
LORE is introduced as a training-free and efficient image editing method to address the limitations of inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models. The structural flaw identified in existing methods regarding attention bias is overcome by directly optimizing the inverted noise in LORE. This approach enables stable, controllable, and general-purpose concept replacement without the need for architectural modification or model fine-tuning. The effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose image editing are demonstrated through comprehensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks. LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, offering a promising solution for flexible and high-quality text-driven image editing tasks. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose image editing.

A four-stage pipeline is used to generate captions, ensuring they are based solely on discernible data from the chart. Human verification through a cycle consistency-based approach accelerates quality control without compromising accuracy. A novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, evaluates caption quality by comparing the regenerated chart from a caption to the original chart. Experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned on ChartCap produce more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations compared to existing models and human-annotated captions. ChartCap surpasses open-source and proprietary models, highlighting the effectiveness of the dataset in enhancing caption generation for charts.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.03164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific, dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

Summary: <br />
- Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown breakthroughs in complex visual-textual understanding but face hallucination issues, especially in stylized images. 
- A dataset with photographic and stylized image pairs and annotated captions was created for benchmarking 13 LVLMs on discriminative and generative tasks. 
- Stylized images induce more hallucinations than photographic ones, posing risks in critical scenarios. 
- A novel mechanism called SAVER was introduced to adjust LVLM outputs based on visual attention patterns, mitigating hallucinations from stylized images. 
- Extensive experiments showed that SAVER significantly improved hallucination mitigation in various models, datasets, and tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.03177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) recently achieve significant breakthroughs in understanding complex visual-textual contexts. However, hallucination issues still limit their real-world applicability. Although previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images, which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware Visual Early Revision SAVER, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts LVLMs' final outputs based on the token-level visual attention patterns, leveraging early-layer feedback to mitigate hallucinations caused by stylized images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAVER achieves state-of-the-art performance in hallucination mitigation across various models, datasets, and tasks.

The paper introduces Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that combines proxy Gaussian representations and order-independent rendering to enhance 3D Gaussian Splatting efficiency and realism. By incorporating cell proxies and cell search rasterization, the method addresses the computational overhead associated with view-adaptive radix sort. It integrates Order-Independent Transparency (OIT) to develop a weighted sum rendering technique that resolves artifacts and improves rendering accuracy. Extensive experiments validate the robustness of the approach across various scenarios, achieving a 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT-based methods and reducing radix sort overhead by 52.2% to 86.9% without compromising quality. The proposed method offers high-quality rendering in real-time, demonstrating significant advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting technology. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable rendering fidelity and efficiency. However, these methods still rely on computationally expensive sequential alpha-blending operations, resulting in significant overhead, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. In this paper, we propose Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that integrates proxy Gaussian representations with order-independent rendering techniques to achieve photorealistic results while sustaining real-time performance. To mitigate the overhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for local Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further acceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent Transparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering technique that simultaneously eliminates "popping" and "transparency" artifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale training views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the advantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving high-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT based Gaussian Splatting approaches and 52.2% to 86.9% reduction of the radix sort overhead without quality degradation.

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation remains a challenging problem due to the inherent ambiguity that stems from the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D structure from a single view, where multiple plausible depth configurations can produce identical 2D projections. In this paper, we present a novel depth estimation method that combines both local and global cues to improve prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose the Gated Large Kernel Attention Module (GLKAM) to effectively capture multi-scale local structural information by leveraging large kernel convolutions with a gated mechanism. To further enhance the global perception of the network, we introduce the Global Bin Prediction Module (GBPM), which estimates the global distribution of depth bins and provides structural guidance for depth regression. Extensive experiments on the NYU-V2 and KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance and outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness of each proposed component.

Summary:
The paper discusses the challenge of face forgery detection in a continually evolving landscape of forgery techniques. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are proposed as a solution due to their ability to adapt to new forgery types while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs face limitations in handling high-dimensional image inputs and overlapping features from different domains. The proposed KAN-based Continual Face Forgery Detection (KAN-CFD) framework addresses these limitations through a Domain-Group KAN Detector (DG-KD) for high-dimensional image inputs and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP) to prevent overlap of KAN input spaces. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance in face forgery detection while reducing forgetting significantly.<br /><br />Summary: The paper introduces a novel approach called KAN-CFD for continual face forgery detection, leveraging KANs with locally plastic splines to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. By using DG-KD for high-dimensional image inputs and FS-KDCP to prevent input space overlap, the framework achieves superior performance in adapting to new forgery types while addressing the limitations of traditional KANs. <div>

Abstract: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector (DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance while notably reducing forgetting.

Summary: <br />
Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is a major factor in wet age-related macular degeneration, a common cause of blindness. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is used to study CNV, but challenges exist in accurate segmentation due to irregular shapes and image limitations. To address this, a new publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg) is introduced, along with a novel segmentation network called MTG-Net. This network combines region and vessel information, utilizing graph-based modules to analyze geometric features and relationships across tasks. An uncertainty-weighted loss helps improve segmentation accuracy. Experimental results show MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving high Dice scores for region and vessel segmentation. <div>

Abstract: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus, accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR) and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism, enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally, an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\% for region segmentation and 88.12\% for vessel segmentation.

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information and global context, effectively mitigating interference from category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/AlignCAT.

<title>Open-Vocabulary HOI Detection with Interaction-aware Prompt and Concept Calibration</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03207</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to detect interactions between humans and objects while generalizing to novel interaction classes beyond the training set. Current methods often rely on Vision and Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues, we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/ltttpku/INP-CC.

<title>GeoShield: Safeguarding Geolocation Privacy from Vision-Language Models via Adversarial Perturbations</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03209</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating privacy concerns.

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models. Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore, developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code is available in the supplementary materials.

<title>ActionSink: Toward Precise Robot Manipulation with Dynamic Integration of Action Flow</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03218</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance. To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e., ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos, called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically, ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\% success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.

arXiv:2508.03227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian Splatting. Existing methods often suffer from inconsistent 2D masks across viewpoints and produce noisy segmentation boundaries as they neglect these semantic cues to refine the learned Gaussians. To overcome this, we introduce Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation boundaries. Experimental results show that our method extracts clean 3D assets and consistently improves 3D segmentation in both online (e.g., self-prompting) and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) settings, enabling applications such as hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient characterization of nanoparticle morphology in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images is critical for ensuring product quality in nanomaterial synthesis and accelerating development. However, conventional deep learning methods for shape classification require extensive labeled datasets and computationally demanding training, limiting their accessibility to the typical nanoparticle practitioner in research and industrial settings. In this study, we introduce a zero-shot classification pipeline that leverages two vision foundation models: the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for object segmentation and DINOv2 for feature embedding. By combining these models with a lightweight classifier, we achieve high-precision shape classification across three morphologically diverse nanoparticle datasets - without the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning. Our methodology outperforms a fine-tuned YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high baselines, demonstrating robustness to small datasets, subtle morphological variations, and domain shifts from natural to scientific imaging. Quantitative clustering metrics on PCA plots of the DINOv2 features are discussed as a means of assessing the progress of the chemical synthesis. This work highlights the potential of foundation models to advance automated microscopy image analysis, offering an alternative to traditional deep learning pipelines in nanoparticle research which is both more efficient and more accessible to the user.

Abstract: Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression, undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.

Abstract: We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features, our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution, low latency, and high dynamic range. However, their limited spatial resolution poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN. Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss (LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or using it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks.

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust 3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this, we propose a \textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \textbf{S}parse 3D object \textbf{D}etection \textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations. Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference, further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art detection.

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality. To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO, that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2% and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation.

Abstract: Existing handwritten text generation methods primarily focus on isolated words. However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text lines emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style patterns encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships, and maintaining content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2) multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text lines, particularly in style reproduction and content preservation.

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for applications in augmented and virtual reality, egocentric action recognition has emerged as a prominent research area. It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed behavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon (i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most existing approaches treat these two components as independent classification tasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking their inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented representations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct the egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting strategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified Prompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component representations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and nouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair form. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an attention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure the prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training objective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two perspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge Orthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt achieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and base-to-novel generalization benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via whole slide images (WSIs) is critical for preventing severe maternal and fetal complications. However, WSI analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1) inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich global contextual understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on both a self-constructed patient-level Placental dataset and two public datasets demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance.

<title>Zero Shot Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation by Synthetic Data Generation and Progressive Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results yet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test data. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy, ensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot semantic segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/ROUJINN/SDGPA

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

Abstract: Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD) provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods, distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level, neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation). We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.

Abstract: We introduce Skywork UniPic, a 1.5 billion-parameter autoregressive model that unifies image understanding, text-to-image generation, and image editing within a single architecture-eliminating the need for task-specific adapters or inter-module connectors-and demonstrate that compact multimodal systems can achieve state-of-the-art performance on commodity hardware. Skywork UniPic achieves a GenEval score of 0.86, surpassing most existing unified models; sets a new DPG-Bench complex-generation record of 85.5; attains 5.83 on GEditBench-EN and 3.49 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing; and generates 1024 x 1024 images with under 15 GB of GPU memory (e.g., RTX 4090). (1) a decoupled encoding strategy that leverages a masked autoregressive encoder for synthesis and a SigLIP2 encoder for understanding, all feeding a shared autoregressive decoder; (2) a progressive, resolution-aware training schedule scaling from 256 x 256 to 1024 x 1024 while dynamically unfreezing parameters to balance capacity and stability; and (3) meticulously curated, 100 million-scale datasets augmented with task-specific reward models to refine generation and editing objectives. By demonstrating that high-fidelity multimodal integration need not incur prohibitive resource demands, Skywork UniPic establishes a practical paradigm for deployable, high-fidelity multimodal AI.

Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding. These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based HGR.

Abstract: The exponential growth in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usage underscores the critical need of detecting them at extended distances to ensure safe operations, especially in densely populated areas. Despite the tremendous advances made in computer vision through deep learning, the detection of these small airborne objects remains a formidable challenge. While several datasets have been developed specifically for drone detection, the need for a more extensive and diverse collection of drone image data persists, particularly for long-range detection under varying environmental conditions. We introduce here the Long Range Drone Detection (LRDD) Version 2 dataset, comprising 39,516 meticulously annotated images, as a second release of the LRDD dataset released previously. The LRDDv2 dataset enhances the LRDDv1 by incorporating a greater variety of images, providing a more diverse and comprehensive resource for drone detection research. What sets LRDDv2 apart is its inclusion of target range information for over 8,000 images, making it possible to develop algorithms for drone range estimation. Tailored for long-range aerial object detection, the majority of LRDDv2's dataset consists of images capturing drones with 50 or fewer pixels in 1080p resolution.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL) for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning. Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments. Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated videos and comparison results are in our project page.

<title>Beyond Illumination: Fine-Grained Detail Preservation in Extreme Dark Image Restoration</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging due to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges, limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with minimal computational overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/bywlzts/RFGM.

<title>Less is More: Token-Efficient Video-QA via Adaptive Frame-Pruning and Semantic Graph Integration</title>

arXiv:2508.03337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution. Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective, still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon publication.

<title>CIVQLLIE: Causal Intervention with Vector Quantization for Low-Light Image Enhancement</title>

arXiv:2508.03338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Images captured in nighttime scenes suffer from severely reduced visibility, hindering effective content perception. Current low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping networks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling under extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on simplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that leverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal reasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps continuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from large-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior, encoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of degradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to distribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook. Therefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to systematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level Causal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with the brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective Attention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by illumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while enhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible feature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail Reconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the matched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable convolution techniques.

Abstract: Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment. To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information. (3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving 17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets, respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

arXiv:2508.03351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining. While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models (LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.}, limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs. However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations. Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

arXiv:2508.03356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows, conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients. Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process: first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy, and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while assuming limited-resource clients.

Abstract: Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details. The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method, Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models. Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then, parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.

arXiv:2508.03374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates anatomical context.

Abstract: Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when encountering new datasets. Nevertheless, retrained models frequently encounter difficulties in preserving knowledge from previous datasets, leading to a significant decline in performance on earlier test sets. To tackle these challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt, which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks, thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation \textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}). Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively addressing the ETTA challenge.

<title>DepthGait: Multi-Scale Cross-Level Feature Fusion of RGB-Derived Depth and Silhouette Sequences for Robust Gait Recognition</title>

Abstract: Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which are closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons have dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of capturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations, and capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and silhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D silhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly estimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new modality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In addition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been developed to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed DepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and attains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.

<title>SCFlow: Implicitly Learning Style and Content Disentanglement with Flow Models</title>

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51 styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks, we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at estimating material signatures (known as endmembers) and the corresponding proportions (referred to abundances), which is a critical preprocessing step in various hyperspectral imagery applications. This study develops a novel approach called sparsity and total variation (TV) constrained multilayer linear unmixing (STVMLU) for hyperspectral imagery. Specifically, based on a multilayer matrix factorization model, to improve the accuracy of unmixing, a TV constraint is incorporated to consider adjacent spatial similarity. Additionally, a L1/2-norm sparse constraint is adopted to effectively characterize the sparsity of the abundance matrix. For optimizing the STVMLU model, the method of alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is employed, which allows for the simultaneous extraction of endmembers and their corresponding abundance matrix. Experimental results illustrate the enhanced performance of the proposed STVMLU when compared to other algorithms.

arXiv:2508.03404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists, remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks. To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e., planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code will be available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/MACT.git.

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task, especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running 1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video segmentation models.

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics, including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and qualitative output.

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved. However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention. Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph, input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Medical_Image_Analysis.

<title>Spatial Imputation Drives Cross-Domain Alignment for EEG Classification</title>

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations. Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods, IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across 10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification accuracy.

Abstract: Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) aims to select informative samples for annotation without prior knowledge, which is important for improving annotation efficiency and model performance under a limited annotation budget in medical image analysis. Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated, with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for classification. The code is available at https://github.com/HiLab-git/MedCAL-Bench.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in image and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the standard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image (SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality, robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and hyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance adaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative models.

Abstract: Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models have shown remarkable performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). With fine-tuning on a single auxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on diverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to manually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert knowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis (CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling. Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into prompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism, extensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and medical datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/cqylunlun/CoPS.

Abstract: Moire patterns, unwanted color artifacts in images and videos, arise from the interference between spatially high-frequency scene contents and the spatial discrete sampling of digital cameras. Existing demoireing methods primarily rely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical challenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real textures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while removing moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus (retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture, so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely outperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.

Abstract: Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and intermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images, dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network (AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI) module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling, sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales, thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive performance in video-based polyp detection tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows, yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost. Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient framework applicable to various models.

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity. Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the baseline methods.

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models without requiring additional fine-tuning.

<title>When Cars Have Stereotypes: Auditing Demographic Bias in Objects from Text-to-Image Models</title>

arXiv:2508.03483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories. Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

<title>LRQ-DiT: Log-Rotation Post-Training Quantization of Diffusion Transformers for Text-to-Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in text-to-image generation. However, their high computational cost and large parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors; (2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ, and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

Abstract: The construction industry represents a major sector in terms of resource consumption. Recycled construction material has high reuse potential, but quality monitoring of the aggregates is typically still performed with manual methods. Vision-based machine learning methods could offer a faster and more efficient solution to this problem, but existing segmentation methods are by design not directly applicable to images with hundreds of small particles. In this paper, we propose ParticleSAM, an adaptation of the segmentation foundation model to images with small and dense objects such as the ones often encountered in construction material particles. Moreover, we create a new dense multi-particle dataset simulated from isolated particle images with the assistance of an automated data generation and labeling pipeline. This dataset serves as a benchmark for visual material quality control automation while our segmentation approach has the potential to be valuable in application areas beyond construction where small-particle segmentation is needed. Our experimental results validate the advantages of our method by comparing to the original SAM method both in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

<title>Quality Versus Sparsity in Image Recovery by Dictionary Learning Using Iterative Shrinkage</title>

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) is a fundamental technique that is useful for many image processing tasks. As an example we consider here image recovery, where SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of problems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms that are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the learned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing or storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a combination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible. Therefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in SDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the sparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization methods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on the method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in general not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite different from the learning database.

<title>Prototype-Enhanced Confidence Modeling for Cross-Modal Medical Image-Report Retrieval</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03494</link>

Abstract: In cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as image-to-report and report-to-image retrieval, accurately aligning medical images with relevant text reports is essential but challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and variability in medical data. Existing models often struggle to capture the nuanced, multi-level semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable retrieval results. To address these issues, we propose the Prototype-Enhanced Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework, which introduces multi-level prototypes for each modality to better capture semantic variability and enhance retrieval robustness. PECM employs a dual-stream confidence estimation that leverages prototype similarity distributions and an adaptive weighting mechanism to control the impact of high-uncertainty data on retrieval rankings. Applied to radiology image-report datasets, our method achieves significant improvements in retrieval precision and consistency, effectively handling data ambiguity and advancing reliability in complex clinical scenarios. We report results on multiple different datasets and tasks including fully supervised and zero-shot retrieval obtaining performance gains of up to 10.17%, establishing in new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization. Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing.

Abstract: Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (CD-FSMIS) is a potential solution for segmenting medical images with limited annotation using knowledge from other domains. The significant performance of current CD-FSMIS models relies on the heavily training procedure over other source medical domains, which degrades the universality and ease of model deployment. With the development of large visual models of natural images, we propose a training-free CD-FSMIS model that introduces the Multi-center Adaptive Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP) strategy for adapting the foundation model Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is trained with natural images, into the CD-FSMIS task. To be specific, MAUP consists of three key innovations: (1) K-means clustering based multi-center prompts generation for comprehensive spatial coverage, (2) uncertainty-aware prompts selection that focuses on the challenging regions, and (3) adaptive prompt optimization that can dynamically adjust according to the target region complexity. With the pre-trained DINOv2 feature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three medical datasets without any additional training compared with several conventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model. The source code is available at: https://github.com/YazhouZhu19/MAUP.

<title>Distribution-aware Knowledge Unification and Association for Non-exemplar Lifelong Person Re-identification</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03516</link>

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) encounters a key challenge: balancing the preservation of old knowledge with adaptation to new information. Existing LReID methods typically employ knowledge distillation to enforce representation alignment. However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects: specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning, both of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing anti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a distribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the current domain into the domain-specific representations with the different domain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next, we propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the unified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further mitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA) mechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly model inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally, distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current domain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center, improving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms the existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively. Our code will be publicly released.

<title>Semantic Mosaicing of Histo-Pathology Image Fragments using Visual Foundation Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03524</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope slide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire structures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling analysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation, inhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing regions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits state-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to reconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce SemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual histopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different fragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching candidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments on three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher yields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art in correct boundary matches.

<title>CoEmoGen: Towards Semantically-Coherent and Scalable Emotional Image Content Generation</title>

Abstract: Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) aims to generate semantically clear and emotionally faithful images based on given emotion categories, with broad application prospects. While recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating concrete concepts, they struggle with the complexity of abstract emotions. There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but they excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer from semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore, inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank Adaptation (HiLoRA) module to cohesively model both polarity-shared low-level features and emotion-specific high-level semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic coherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives. To intuitively showcase scalability, we curate EmoArt, a large-scale dataset of emotionally evocative artistic images, providing endless inspiration for emotion-driven artistic creation. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/yuankaishen2001/CoEmoGen.

<title>Retinal Lipidomics Associations as Candidate Biomarkers for Cardiovascular Health</title>

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits, applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes independent of disease status or treatment effects.

<title>Quality-Aware Language-Conditioned Local Auto-Regressive Anomaly Synthesis and Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing diffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural deficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic controllability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis approach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized dataset will be publicly available.

<title>Speech-to-LaTeX: New Models and Datasets for Converting Spoken Equations and Sentences</title>

Abstract: Conversion of spoken mathematical expressions is a challenging task that involves transcribing speech into a strictly structured symbolic representation while addressing the ambiguity inherent in the pronunciation of equations. Although significant progress has been achieved in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and language models (LM), the problem of converting spoken mathematics into LaTeX remains underexplored. This task directly applies to educational and research domains, such as lecture transcription or note creation. Based on ASR post-correction, prior work requires 2 transcriptions, focuses only on isolated equations, has a limited test set, and provides neither training data nor multilingual coverage. To address these issues, we present the first fully open-source large-scale dataset, comprising over 66,000 human-annotated audio samples of mathematical equations and sentences in both English and Russian, drawn from diverse scientific domains. In addition to the ASR post-correction models and few-shot prompting, we apply audio language models, demonstrating comparable character error rate (CER) results on the MathSpeech benchmark (28% vs. 30%) for the equations conversion. In contrast, on the proposed S2L-equations benchmark, our models outperform the MathSpeech model by a substantial margin of more than 40 percentage points, even after accounting for LaTeX formatting artifacts (27% vs. 64%). We establish the first benchmark for mathematical sentence recognition (S2L-sentences) and achieve an equation CER of 40%. This work lays the groundwork for future advances in multimodal AI, with a particular focus on mathematical content recognition.

<title>Advancing Wildlife Monitoring: Drone-Based Sampling for Roe Deer Density Estimation</title>

Abstract: We use unmanned aerial drones to estimate wildlife density in southeastern Austria and compare these estimates to camera trap data. Traditional methods like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape. Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects. This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones, minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity: naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM, except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife density estimation.

<title>Beyond Meme Templates: Limitations of Visual Similarity Measures in Meme Matching</title>

Abstract: Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in how users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain insight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However, most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that requires more sophisticated matching techniques.

<title>A Scalable Machine Learning Pipeline for Building Footprint Detection in Historical Maps</title>

Abstract: Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes and settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6 inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co. Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25 inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the Great Famine period.

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of adapting the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for various downstream tasks. However, constructing a more powerful and generalizable encoder to further enhance performance remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose SAM2-UNeXT, an advanced framework that builds upon the core principles of SAM2-UNet while extending the representational capacity of SAM2 through the integration of an auxiliary DINOv2 encoder. By incorporating a dual-resolution strategy and a dense glue layer, our approach enables more accurate segmentation with a simple architecture, relaxing the need for complex decoder designs. Extensive experiments conducted on four benchmarks, including dichotomous image segmentation, camouflaged object detection, marine animal segmentation, and remote sensing saliency detection, demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/WZH0120/SAM2-UNeXT.

<title>RadProPoser: A Framework for Human Pose Estimation with Uncertainty Quantification from Raw Radar Data</title>

arXiv:2508.03578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving, illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy, multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26 three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals, with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021. As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification, resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently, with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses (micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution. However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics. MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment (OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF) distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

Abstract: Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines, DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95 across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and autonomous systems.

Abstract: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions remain significant limitations in satellite-based remote sensing, often restricting the availability and usability of multi-spectral imagery. In contrast, Sentinel-1 radar images are unaffected by cloud cover and can provide consistent data regardless of weather or lighting conditions. To address the challenges of limited satellite imagery, we propose CloudBreaker, a novel framework that generates high-quality multi-spectral Sentinel-2 signals from Sentinel-1 data. This includes the reconstruction of optical (RGB) images as well as critical vegetation and water indices such as NDVI and NDWI.We employed a novel multi-stage training approach based on conditional latent flow matching and, to the best of our knowledge, are the first to integrate cosine scheduling with flow matching. CloudBreaker demonstrates strong performance, achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score of 0.7432, indicating high fidelity and realism in the generated optical imagery. The model also achieved Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 0.6156 for NDWI and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating a high degree of structural similarity. This establishes CloudBreaker as a promising solution for a wide range of remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is typically unavailable or unreliable

<title>evTransFER: A Transfer Learning Framework for Event-based Facial Expression Recognition</title>

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously capture per-pixel intensity changes with microsecond latency, high temporal resolution, and high dynamic range, providing valuable information about the spatio-temporal dynamics of the scene. In the present work, we propose evTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face expression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a feature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces, built by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem (facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to the face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer learning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions compared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an architecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression dynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as TIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed framework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed framework evTransFER achieves a 93.6\% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database, significantly improving the accuracy (25.9\% points or more) when compared to state-of-the-art performance for similar problems.

Abstract: We introduce FPG-NAS, a FLOPs-aware Gated Differentiable Neural Architecture Search framework for efficient 6DoF object pose estimation. Estimating 3D rotation and translation from a single image has been widely investigated yet remains computationally demanding, limiting applicability in resource-constrained scenarios. FPG-NAS addresses this by proposing a specialized differentiable NAS approach for 6DoF pose estimation, featuring a task-specific search space and a differentiable gating mechanism that enables discrete multi-candidate operator selection, thus improving architectural diversity. Additionally, a FLOPs regularization term ensures a balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The framework explores a vast search space of approximately 10\textsuperscript{92} possible architectures. Experiments on the LINEMOD and SPEED+ datasets demonstrate that FPG-NAS-derived models outperform previous methods under strict FLOPs constraints. To the best of our knowledge, FPG-NAS is the first differentiable NAS framework specifically designed for 6DoF object pose estimation.

arXiv:2508.03625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Attention Zoom, a modular and model-agnostic spatial attention mechanism designed to improve feature extraction in convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Unlike traditional attention approaches that require architecture-specific integration, our method introduces a standalone layer that spatially emphasizes high-importance regions in the input. We evaluated Attention Zoom on multiple CNN backbones using CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, showing consistent improvements in Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy. Visual analyses using Grad-CAM and spatial warping reveal that our method encourages fine-grained and diverse attention patterns. Our results confirm the effectiveness and generality of the proposed layer for improving CCNs with minimal architectural overhead.

<title>Uni3R: Unified 3D Reconstruction and Semantic Understanding via Generalizable Gaussian Splatting from Unposed Multi-View Images</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D scene reconstruction and understanding. The code is available at https://github.com/HorizonRobotics/Uni3R.

Abstract: We would like to estimate the pose and full shape of an object from a single observation, without assuming known 3D model or category. In this work, we propose OmniShape, the first method of its kind to enable probabilistic pose and shape estimation. OmniShape is based on the key insight that shape completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by the dataset and the other modelling a prior over object geometries represented as triplanar neural fields. By training separate conditional diffusion models for these two distributions, we enable sampling multiple hypotheses from the joint pose and shape distribution. OmniShape demonstrates compelling performance on challenging real world datasets. Project website: https://tri-ml.github.io/omnishape

<title>Veila: Panoramic LiDAR Generation from a Monocular RGB Image</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03690</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially, complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion; and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism (CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes, SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency, while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Controllable generation of realistic LiDAR scenes is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving and robotics. While recent diffusion-based models achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.

arXiv:2508.03692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids, overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic 4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence, and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.03694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging task. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to scale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In this paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate noise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the limitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose LongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video generation. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency: 1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation across clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces alignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual degradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates both dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals, complemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively balances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100 high-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments, each lasting over one minute. Extensive experiments show that LongVie achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and quality.

Abstract: Video understanding requires effective modeling of both motion and appearance information, particularly for few-shot action recognition. While recent advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information, achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits), Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym.

Abstract: The Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) 3.6's mandatory 2026 implementation transforms residential property valuation from narrative reporting to structured, machine-readable formats. This paper provides the first comprehensive analysis of this regulatory shift alongside concurrent AI advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous systems. We develop a three-layer framework for AI-augmented valuation addressing technical implementation and institutional trust requirements. Our analysis reveals how regulatory standardization converging with AI capabilities enables fundamental market restructuring with profound implications for professional practice, efficiency, and systemic risk. We make four key contributions: (1) documenting institutional failures including inter-appraiser variability and systematic biases undermining valuation reliability; (2) developing an architectural framework spanning physical data acquisition, semantic understanding, and cognitive reasoning that integrates emerging technologies while maintaining professional oversight; (3) addressing trust requirements for high-stakes financial applications including regulatory compliance, algorithmic fairness, and uncertainty quantification; (4) proposing evaluation methodologies beyond generic AI benchmarks toward domain-specific protocols. Our findings indicate successful transformation requires not merely technological sophistication but careful human-AI collaboration, creating systems that augment rather than replace professional expertise while addressing historical biases and information asymmetries in real estate markets.

Abstract: Counterfactual generation offers a principled framework for simulating hypothetical changes in medical imaging, with potential applications in understanding disease mechanisms and generating physiologically plausible data. However, generating realistic structural 3D brain MRIs that respect anatomical and causal constraints remains challenging due to data scarcity, structural complexity, and the lack of standardized evaluation protocols. In this work, we convert six generative models into 3D counterfactual approaches by incorporating an anatomy-guided framework based on a causal graph, in which regional brain volumes serve as direct conditioning inputs. Each model is evaluated with respect to composition, reversibility, realism, effectiveness and minimality on T1-weighted brain MRIs (T1w MRIs) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In addition, we test the generalizability of each model with respect to T1w MRIs of the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA). Our results indicate that anatomically grounded conditioning successfully modifies the targeted anatomical regions; however, it exhibits limitations in preserving non-targeted structures. Beyond laying the groundwork for more interpretable and clinically relevant generative modeling of brain MRIs, this benchmark highlights the need for novel architectures that more accurately capture anatomical interdependencies.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) in brain imaging is crucial for identifying pathologies without the need for labeled data. However, accurately localizing anomalies remains challenging due to the intricate structure of brain anatomy and the scarcity of abnormal examples. In this work, we introduce REFLECT, a novel framework that leverages rectified flows to establish a direct, linear trajectory for correcting abnormal MR images toward a normal distribution. By learning a straight, one-step correction transport map, our method efficiently corrects brain anomalies and can precisely localize anomalies by detecting discrepancies between anomalous input and corrected counterpart. In contrast to the diffusion-based UAD models, which require iterative stochastic sampling, rectified flows provide a direct transport map, enabling single-step inference. Extensive experiments on popular UAD brain segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that REFLECT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection methods. The code is available at https://github.com/farzad-bz/REFLECT.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss, making effective prognosis crucial for timely intervention. In this work, we propose AMD-Mamba, a novel multi-modal framework for AMD prognosis, and further develop a new AMD biomarker. This framework integrates color fundus images with genetic variants and socio-demographic variables. At its core, AMD-Mamba introduces an innovative metric learning strategy that leverages AMD severity scale score as prior knowledge. This strategy allows the model to learn richer feature representations by aligning learned features with clinical phenotypes, thereby improving the capability of conventional prognosis methods in capturing disease progression patterns. In addition, unlike existing models that use traditional CNN backbones and focus primarily on local information, such as the presence of drusen, AMD-Mamba applies Vision Mamba and simultaneously fuses local and long-range global information, such as vascular changes. Furthermore, we enhance prediction performance through multi-scale fusion, combining image information with clinical variables at different resolutions. We evaluate AMD-Mamba on the AREDS dataset, which includes 45,818 color fundus photographs, 52 genetic variants, and 3 socio-demographic variables from 2,741 subjects. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed biomarker is one of the most significant biomarkers for the progression of AMD. Notably, combining this biomarker with other existing variables yields promising improvements in detecting high-risk AMD patients at early stages. These findings highlight the potential of our multi-modal framework to facilitate more precise and proactive management of AMD.

Abstract: Despite their success in image classification, modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) exhibit fundamental limitations, including data inefficiency, poor out-of-distribution generalization, and vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. The primate visual system, in contrast, demonstrates superior efficiency and robustness, suggesting that its architectural principles may offer a blueprint for more capable artificial vision systems. This paper introduces Visual Cortex Network (VCNet), a novel neural network architecture whose design is informed by the macro-scale organization of the primate visual cortex. VCNet emulates key biological mechanisms, including hierarchical processing across distinct cortical areas, dual-stream information segregation, and top-down predictive feedback. We evaluate VCNet on two specialized benchmarks: the Spots-10 animal pattern dataset and a light field image classification task. Our results show that VCNet achieves a classification accuracy of 92.1\% on Spots-10 and 74.4\% on the light field dataset, surpassing contemporary models of comparable size. This work demonstrates that integrating neuroscientific principles into network design can lead to more efficient and robust models, providing a promising direction for addressing long-standing challenges in machine learning.

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion integrates complementary information from different imaging modalities to enhance diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. While deep learning methods have advanced performance, existing approaches face critical limitations: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at local feature extraction but struggle to model global context effectively, while Transformers achieve superior long-range modeling at the cost of quadratic computational complexity, limiting clinical deployment. Recent State Space Models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative, enabling efficient long-range dependency modeling in linear time through selective scan mechanisms. Despite these advances, the extension to 3D volumetric data and the clinical validation of fused images remains underexplored. In this work, we propose ClinicalFMamba, a novel end-to-end CNN-Mamba hybrid architecture that synergistically combines local and global feature modeling for 2D and 3D images. We further design a tri-plane scanning strategy for effectively learning volumetric dependencies in 3D images. Comprehensive evaluations on three datasets demonstrate the superior fusion performance across multiple quantitative metrics while achieving real-time fusion. We further validate the clinical utility of our approach on downstream 2D/3D brain tumor classification tasks, achieving superior performance over baseline methods. Our method establishes a new paradigm for efficient multimodal medical image fusion suitable for real-time clinical deployment.

Abstract: Point clouds have become an increasingly important representation for 3D medical imaging, offering a compact, surface-preserving alternative to traditional voxel or mesh-based approaches. Recent advances in deep learning have enabled rapid progress in extracting, modeling, and analyzing anatomical shapes directly from point cloud data. This paper provides a comprehensive and systematic survey of learning-based shape analysis for medical point clouds, focusing on three fundamental tasks: registration, reconstruction, and variation modeling. We review recent literature from 2021 to 2025, summarize representative methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics, and highlight clinical applications and unique challenges in the medical domain. Key trends include the integration of hybrid representations, large-scale self-supervised models, and generative techniques. We also discuss current limitations, such as data scarcity, inter-patient variability, and the need for interpretable and robust solutions for clinical deployment. Finally, future directions are outlined for advancing point cloud-based shape learning in medical imaging.

Abstract: Arbitrary-resolution super-resolution (ARSR) provides crucial flexibility for medical image analysis by adapting to diverse spatial resolutions. However, traditional CNN-based methods are inherently ill-suited for ARSR, as they are typically designed for fixed upsampling factors. While INR-based methods overcome this limitation, they still struggle to effectively process and leverage multi-modal images with varying resolutions and details. In this paper, we propose Nexus-INR, a Diverse Knowledge-guided ARSR framework, which employs varied information and downstream tasks to achieve high-quality, adaptive-resolution medical image super-resolution. Specifically, Nexus-INR contains three key components. A dual-branch encoder with an auxiliary classification task to effectively disentangle shared anatomical structures and modality-specific features; a knowledge distillation module using cross-modal attention that guides low-resolution modality reconstruction with high-resolution reference, enhanced by self-supervised consistency loss; an integrated segmentation module that embeds anatomical semantics to improve both reconstruction quality and downstream segmentation performance. Experiments on the BraTS2020 dataset for both super-resolution and downstream segmentation demonstrate that Nexus-INR outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics.

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples (UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox: users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image (noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

Abstract: In recent years,Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in the field of image generation.However,recent studies have shown that diffusion models are susceptible to backdoor attacks,in which attackers can manipulate the output by injecting covert triggers such as specific visual patterns or textual phrases into the training dataset.Fortunately,with the continuous advancement of defense techniques,defenders have become increasingly capable of identifying and mitigating most backdoor attacks using visual inspection and neural network-based detection methods.However,in this paper,we identify a novel type of backdoor threat that is more lightweight and covert than existing approaches,which we name BadBlocks,requires only about 30\% of the computational resources and 20\% GPU time typically needed by previous backdoor attacks,yet it successfully injects backdoors and evades the most advanced defense frameworks.BadBlocks enables attackers to selectively contaminate specific blocks within the UNet architecture of diffusion models while maintaining normal functionality in the remaining components.Experimental results demonstrate that BadBlocks achieves a high attack success rate (ASR) and low perceptual quality loss (as measured by FID Score),even under extremely constrained computational resources and GPU time.Moreover,BadBlocks is able to bypass existing defense frameworks,especially the attention-based backdoor detection method, highlighting it as a novel and noteworthy threat.Ablation studies further demonstrate that effective backdoor injection does not require fine-tuning the entire network and highlight the pivotal role of certain neural network layers in backdoor mapping.Overall,BadBlocks significantly reduces the barrier to conducting backdoor attacks in all aspects.It enables attackers to inject backdoors into large-scale diffusion models even using consumer-grade GPUs.

Abstract: Galaxy image translation is an important application in galaxy physics and cosmology. With deep learning-based generative models, image translation has been performed for image generation, data quality enhancement, information extraction, and generalized for other tasks such as deblending and anomaly detection. However, most endeavors on image translation primarily focus on the pixel-level and morphology-level statistics of galaxy images. There is a lack of discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical information, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely on high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical information (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and morphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin Transformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS and CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of incapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures of galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In particular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain meaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable uncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to the nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images may still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise for downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly required. Our work can facilitate further research on how complex physical information is manifested on galaxy images, and it provides implications on the development of image translation models for scientific use.

Abstract: Dexterous grasp datasets are vital for embodied intelligence, but mostly emphasize grasp stability, ignoring functional grasps needed for tasks like opening bottle caps or holding cup handles. Most rely on bulky, costly, and hard-to-control high-DOF Shadow Hands. Inspired by the human hand's underactuated mechanism, we establish UniFucGrasp, a universal functional grasp annotation strategy and dataset for multiple dexterous hand types. Based on biomimicry, it maps natural human motions to diverse hand structures and uses geometry-based force closure to ensure functional, stable, human-like grasps. This method supports low-cost, efficient collection of diverse, high-quality functional grasps. Finally, we establish the first multi-hand functional grasp dataset and provide a synthesis model to validate its effectiveness. Experiments on the UFG dataset, IsaacSim, and complex robotic tasks show that our method improves functional manipulation accuracy and grasp stability, enables efficient generalization across diverse robotic hands, and overcomes annotation cost and generalization challenges in dexterous grasping.

Abstract: Chest X-Ray (CXR) imaging for pulmonary diagnosis raises significant challenges, primarily because bone structures can obscure critical details necessary for accurate diagnosis. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly with diffusion models, offer significant promise for effectively minimizing the visibility of bone structures in CXR images, thereby improving clarity and diagnostic accuracy. Nevertheless, existing diffusion-based methods for bone suppression in CXR imaging struggle to balance the complete suppression of bones with preserving local texture details. Additionally, their high computational demand and extended processing time hinder their practical use in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we introduce a Global-Local Latent Consistency Model (GL-LCM) architecture. This model combines lung segmentation, dual-path sampling, and global-local fusion, enabling fast high-resolution bone suppression in CXR images. To tackle potential boundary artifacts and detail blurring in local-path sampling, we further propose Local-Enhanced Guidance, which addresses these issues without additional training. Comprehensive experiments on a self-collected dataset SZCH-X-Rays, and the public dataset JSRT, reveal that our GL-LCM delivers superior bone suppression and remarkable computational efficiency, significantly outperforming several competitive methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/diaoquesang/GL-LCM.

<title>READ: Real-time and Efficient Asynchronous Diffusion for Audio-driven Talking Head Generation</title>

Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.

<title>Evaluating the Predictive Value of Preoperative MRI for Erectile Dysfunction Following Radical Prostatectomy</title>

Abstract: Accurate preoperative prediction of erectile dysfunction (ED) is important for counseling patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. While clinical features are established predictors, the added value of preoperative MRI remains underexplored. We investigate whether MRI provides additional predictive value for ED at 12 months post-surgery, evaluating four modeling strategies: (1) a clinical-only baseline, representing current state-of-the-art; (2) classical models using handcrafted anatomical features derived from MRI; (3) deep learning models trained directly on MRI slices; and (4) multimodal fusion of imaging and clinical inputs. Imaging-based models (maximum AUC 0.569) slightly outperformed handcrafted anatomical approaches (AUC 0.554) but fell short of the clinical baseline (AUC 0.663). Fusion models offered marginal gains (AUC 0.586) but did not exceed clinical-only performance. SHAP analysis confirmed that clinical features contributed most to predictive performance. Saliency maps from the best-performing imaging model suggested a predominant focus on anatomically plausible regions, such as the prostate and neurovascular bundles. While MRI-based models did not improve predictive performance over clinical features, our findings suggest that they try to capture patterns in relevant anatomical structures and may complement clinical predictors in future multimodal approaches.

<title>CADD: Context aware disease deviations via restoration of brain images using normative conditional diffusion models</title>

Abstract: Applying machine learning to real-world medical data, e.g. from hospital archives, has the potential to revolutionize disease detection in brain images. However, detecting pathology in such heterogeneous cohorts is a difficult challenge. Normative modeling, a form of unsupervised anomaly detection, offers a promising approach to studying such cohorts where the ``normal'' behavior is modeled and can be used at subject level to detect deviations relating to disease pathology. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for anomaly detection due to their ability to capture complex data distributions and generate high-quality images. Their performance relies on image restoration; differences between the original and restored images highlight potential abnormalities. However, unlike normative models, these diffusion model approaches do not incorporate clinical information which provides important context to guide the disease detection process. Furthermore, standard approaches often poorly restore healthy regions, resulting in poor reconstructions and suboptimal detection performance. We present CADD, the first conditional diffusion model for normative modeling in 3D images. To guide the healthy restoration process, we propose a novel inference inpainting strategy which balances anomaly removal with retention of subject-specific features. Evaluated on three challenging datasets, including clinical scans, which may have lower contrast, thicker slices, and motion artifacts, CADD achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting neurological abnormalities in heterogeneous cohorts.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show great promise for complex document understanding, yet their development is critically hampered by inadequate evaluation. Current benchmarks often focus on specific part of document RAG system and use synthetic data with incomplete ground truth and evidence labels, therefore failing to reflect real-world bottlenecks and challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Double-Bench: a new large-scale, multilingual, and multimodal evaluation system that is able to produce fine-grained assessment to each component within document RAG systems. It comprises 3,276 documents (72,880 pages) and 5,168 single- and multi-hop queries across 6 languages and 4 document types with streamlined dynamic update support for potential data contamination issues. Queries are grounded in exhaustively scanned evidence pages and verified by human experts to ensure maximum quality and completeness. Our comprehensive experiments across 9 state-of-the-art embedding models, 4 MLLMs and 4 end-to-end document RAG frameworks demonstrate the gap between text and visual embedding models is narrowing, highlighting the need in building stronger document retrieval models. Our findings also reveal the over-confidence dilemma within current document RAG frameworks that tend to provide answer even without evidence support. We hope our fully open-source Double-Bench provide a rigorous foundation for future research in advanced document RAG systems. We plan to retrieve timely corpus and release new benchmarks on an annual basis.

<title>DiWA: Diffusion Policy Adaptation with World Models</title>

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency, making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex linguistic phenomenon that involves a disparity between literal and intended meanings, making it challenging for sentiment analysis and other emotion-sensitive tasks. While traditional sarcasm detection methods primarily focus on text, recent approaches have incorporated multimodal information. However, the application of Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) in Multimodal Sarcasm Analysis (MSA) remains underexplored. In this paper, we evaluate LVLMs in MSA tasks, specifically focusing on Multimodal Sarcasm Detection and Multimodal Sarcasm Explanation. Through comprehensive experiments, we identify key limitations, such as insufficient visual understanding and a lack of conceptual knowledge. To address these issues, we propose a training-free framework that integrates in-depth object extraction and external conceptual knowledge to improve the model's ability to interpret and explain sarcasm in multimodal contexts. The experimental results on multiple models show the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The code is available at https://github.com/cp-cp/LVLM-MSA.

Abstract: In the knowledge distillation literature, feature-based methods have dominated due to their ability to effectively tap into extensive teacher models. In contrast, logit-based approaches, which aim to distill "dark knowledge" from teachers, typically exhibit inferior performance compared to feature-based methods. To bridge this gap, we present LumiNet, a novel knowledge distillation algorithm designed to enhance logit-based distillation. We introduce the concept of "perception", aiming to calibrate logits based on the model's representation capability. This concept addresses overconfidence issues in the logit-based distillation method while also introducing a novel method to distill knowledge from the teacher. It reconstructs the logits of a sample/instances by considering relationships with other samples in the batch. LumiNet excels on benchmarks like CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and MSCOCO, outperforming the leading feature-based methods, e.g., compared to KD with ResNet18 and MobileNetV2 on ImageNet, it shows improvements of 1.5% and 2.05%, respectively. Codes are available at https://github.com/ismail31416/LumiNet.

Abstract: Information Pursuit (IP) is an explainable prediction algorithm that greedily selects a sequence of interpretable queries about the data in order of information gain, updating its posterior at each step based on observed query-answer pairs. The standard paradigm uses hand-crafted dictionaries of potential data queries curated by a domain expert or a large language model after a human prompt. However, in practice, hand-crafted dictionaries are limited by the expertise of the curator and the heuristics of prompt engineering. This paper introduces a novel approach: learning a dictionary of interpretable queries directly from the dataset. Our query dictionary learning problem is formulated as an optimization problem by augmenting IP's variational formulation with learnable dictionary parameters. To formulate learnable and interpretable queries, we leverage the latent space of large vision and language models like CLIP. To solve the optimization problem, we propose a new query dictionary learning algorithm inspired by classical sparse dictionary learning. Our experiments demonstrate that learned dictionaries significantly outperform hand-crafted dictionaries generated with large language models.

Abstract: Medical phrase grounding is crucial for identifying relevant regions in medical images based on phrase queries, facilitating accurate image analysis and diagnosis. However, current methods rely on manual extraction of key phrases from medical reports, reducing efficiency and increasing the workload for clinicians. Additionally, the lack of model confidence estimation limits clinical trust and usability. In this paper, we introduce a novel task called Medical Report Grounding (MRG), which aims to directly identify diagnostic phrases and their corresponding grounding boxes from medical reports in an end-to-end manner. To address this challenge, we propose uMedGround, a robust and reliable framework that leverages a multimodal large language model to predict diagnostic phrases by embedding a unique token, $<$$\mathtt{BOX}$$>$, into the vocabulary to enhance detection capabilities. A vision encoder-decoder processes the embedded token and input image to generate grounding boxes. Critically, uMedGround incorporates an uncertainty-aware prediction model, significantly improving the robustness and reliability of grounding predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that uMedGround outperforms state-of-the-art medical phrase grounding methods and fine-tuned large visual-language models, validating its effectiveness and reliability. This study represents a pioneering exploration of the MRG task, marking the first-ever endeavor in this domain. Additionally, we demonstrate the applicability of uMedGround in medical visual question answering and class-based localization tasks, where it highlights visual evidence aligned with key diagnostic phrases, supporting clinicians in interpreting various types of textual inputs, including free-text reports, visual question answering queries, and class labels.

Abstract: We examine the problem of selecting a small set of linear measurements for reconstructing high-dimensional signals. Well-established methods for optimizing such measurements include principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA) and compressed sensing (CS) based on random projections, all of which rely on axis- or subspace-aligned statistical characterization of the signal source. However, many naturally occurring signals, including photographic images, contain richer statistical structure. To exploit such structure, we introduce a general method for obtaining an optimized set of linear measurements for efficient image reconstruction, where the signal statistics are expressed by the prior implicit in a neural network trained to perform denoising (known as a "diffusion model"). We demonstrate that the optimal measurements derived for two natural image datasets differ from those of PCA, ICA, or CS, and result in substantially lower mean squared reconstruction error. Interestingly, the marginal distributions of the measurement values are asymmetrical (skewed), substantially more so than those of previous methods. We also find that optimizing with respect to perceptual loss, as quantified by structural similarity (SSIM), leads to measurements different from those obtained when optimizing for MSE. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating the specific statistical regularities of natural signals when designing effective linear measurements.

Abstract: Haze removal aims to restore a clear image from a hazy input. Existing methods achieve notable success by specializing in either short-range dependencies to preserve local details or long-range dependencies to capture global context. Given the complementary strengths of both, a natural progression is to explicitly integrate them within a unified framework and enable their reasonable aggregation. However, this integration remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose DehazeMatic, which simultaneously and explicitly captures both short- and long-range dependencies through a dual-stream design. To optimize the contribution of dependencies at varying ranges, we conduct extensive experiments to identify key influencing factors and find that an effective aggregation mechanism should be guided by the joint consideration of haze density and semantic information. Building on these insights, we introduce the CLIP-enhanced Dual-path Aggregator, which not only enables the generation of fine-grained haze density maps for the first time, but also produces semantic maps within a shared backbone, ultimately leveraging both to instruct the aggregation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DehazeMatic outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Reconstructing objects and extracting high-quality surfaces play a vital role in the real world. Current 4D representations show the ability to render high-quality novel views for dynamic objects, but cannot reconstruct high-quality meshes due to their implicit or geometrically inaccurate representations. In this paper, we propose a novel representation that can reconstruct accurate meshes from sparse image input, named Dynamic 2D Gaussians (D-2DGS). We adopt 2D Gaussians for basic geometry representation and use sparse-controlled points to capture the 2D Gaussian's deformation. By extracting the object mask from the rendered high-quality image and masking the rendered depth map, we remove floaters that are prone to occur during reconstruction and can extract high-quality dynamic mesh sequences of dynamic objects. Experiments demonstrate that our D-2DGS is outstanding in reconstructing detailed and smooth high-quality meshes from sparse inputs. The code is available at https://github.com/hustvl/Dynamic-2DGS.

Abstract: In image editing tasks, high-quality text editing capabilities can significantly reduce both human and material resource costs. Existing methods, however, face significant limitations in terms of stroke accuracy for complex text and controllability of generated text styles. To address these challenges, we propose TextMaster, a solution capable of accurately editing text across various scenarios and image regions, while ensuring proper layout and controllable text style. Our method enhances the accuracy and fidelity of text rendering by incorporating high-resolution standard glyph information and applying perceptual loss within the text editing region. Additionally, we leverage an attention mechanism to compute intermediate layer bounding box regression loss for each character, enabling the model to learn text layout across varying contexts. Furthermore, we propose a novel style injection technique that enables controllable style transfer for the injected text. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method.

Abstract: Data augmentation is a critical component of deep learning pipelines, enhancing model generalization by increasing dataset diversity. Traditional augmentation strategies rely on manually designed transformations, stochastic sampling, or automated search-based approaches. Although automated methods improve performance, they often require extensive computational resources and are specifically designed for certain datasets. In this work, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided augmentation optimization strategy that refines augmentation policies based on model performance feedback. We propose two approaches: (1) LLM-Guided Augmentation Policy Optimization, where augmentation policies selected by LLM are refined iteratively across training cycles, and (2) Adaptive LLM-Guided Augmentation Policy Optimization, which adjusts policies at each iteration based on performance metrics. This in-training approach eliminates the need for full model retraining before getting LLM feedback, reducing computational costs while increasing performance. Our methodology employs an LLM to dynamically select augmentation transformations based on dataset characteristics, model architecture, and prior training performance. Leveraging LLMs' contextual knowledge, especially in domain-specific tasks like medical imaging, our method selects augmentations tailored to dataset characteristics and model performance. Experiments across domain-specific image classification datasets show consistent accuracy improvements over traditional methods.

Abstract: As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses.

Abstract: This paper aims to design a unified Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generation system that can easily generate CAD models based on the user's inputs in the form of textual description, images, point clouds, or even a combination of them. Towards this goal, we introduce the CAD-MLLM, the first system capable of generating parametric CAD models conditioned on the multimodal input. Specifically, within the CAD-MLLM framework, we leverage the command sequences of CAD models and then employ advanced large language models (LLMs) to align the feature space across these diverse multi-modalities data and CAD models' vectorized representations. To facilitate the model training, we design a comprehensive data construction and annotation pipeline that equips each CAD model with corresponding multimodal data. Our resulting dataset, named Omni-CAD, is the first multimodal CAD dataset that contains textual description, multi-view images, points, and command sequence for each CAD model. It contains approximately 450K instances and their CAD construction sequences. To thoroughly evaluate the quality of our generated CAD models, we go beyond current evaluation metrics that focus on reconstruction quality by introducing additional metrics that assess topology quality and surface enclosure extent. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CAD-MLLM significantly outperforms existing conditional generative methods and remains highly robust to noises and missing points.

Abstract: Human's perception of the visual world is shaped by the stereo processing of 3D information. Understanding how the brain perceives and processes 3D visual stimuli in the real world has been a longstanding endeavor in neuroscience. Towards this goal, we introduce a new neuroscience task: decoding 3D visual perception from EEG signals, a neuroimaging technique that enables real-time monitoring of neural dynamics enriched with complex visual cues. To provide the essential benchmark, we first present EEG-3D, a pioneering dataset featuring multimodal analysis data and extensive EEG recordings from 12 subjects viewing 72 categories of 3D objects rendered in both videos and images. Furthermore, we propose Neuro-3D, a 3D visual decoding framework based on EEG signals. This framework adaptively integrates EEG features derived from static and dynamic stimuli to learn complementary and robust neural representations, which are subsequently utilized to recover both the shape and color of 3D objects through the proposed diffusion-based colored point cloud decoder. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore EEG-based 3D visual decoding. Experiments indicate that Neuro-3D not only reconstructs colored 3D objects with high fidelity, but also learns effective neural representations that enable insightful brain region analysis. The dataset and associated code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Personalizing large-scale diffusion models poses serious privacy risks, especially when adapting to small, sensitive datasets. A common approach is to fine-tune the model using differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD), but this suffers from severe utility degradation due to the high noise needed for privacy, particularly in the small data regime. We propose an alternative that leverages Textual Inversion (TI), which learns an embedding vector for an image or set of images, to enable adaptation under differential privacy (DP) constraints. Our approach, Differentially Private Aggregation via Textual Inversion (DPAgg-TI), adds calibrated noise to the aggregation of per-image embeddings to ensure formal DP guarantees while preserving high output fidelity. We show that DPAgg-TI outperforms DP-SGD finetuning in both utility and robustness under the same privacy budget, achieving results closely matching the non-private baseline on style adaptation tasks using private artwork from a single artist and Paris 2024 Olympic pictograms. In contrast, DP-SGD fails to generate meaningful outputs in this setting.

<title>4D Scaffold Gaussian Splatting with Dynamic-Aware Anchor Growing for Efficient and High-Fidelity Dynamic Scene Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Modeling dynamic scenes through 4D Gaussians offers high visual fidelity and fast rendering speeds, but comes with significant storage overhead. Recent approaches mitigate this cost by aggressively reducing the number of Gaussians. However, this inevitably removes Gaussians essential for high-quality rendering, leading to severe degradation in dynamic regions. In this paper, we introduce a novel 4D anchor-based framework that tackles the storage cost in different perspective. Rather than reducing the number of Gaussians, our method retains a sufficient quantity to accurately model dynamic contents, while compressing them into compact, grid-aligned 4D anchor features. Each anchor is processed by an MLP to spawn a set of neural 4D Gaussians, which represent a local spatiotemporal region. We design these neural 4D Gaussians to capture temporal changes with minimal parameters, making them well-suited for the MLP-based spawning. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic-aware anchor growing strategy to effectively assign additional anchors to under-reconstructed dynamic regions. Our method adjusts the accumulated gradients with Gaussians' temporal coverage, significantly improving reconstruction quality in dynamic regions. Experimental results highlight that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual quality in dynamic regions, outperforming all baselines by a large margin with practical storage costs.

<title>Talking to DINO: Bridging Self-Supervised Vision Backbones with Language for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) aims at segmenting images from free-form textual concepts without predefined training classes. While existing vision-language models such as CLIP can generate segmentation masks by leveraging coarse spatial information from Vision Transformers, they face challenges in spatial localization due to their global alignment of image and text features. Conversely, self-supervised visual models like DINO excel in fine-grained visual encoding but lack integration with language. To bridge this gap, we present Talk2DINO, a novel hybrid approach that combines the spatial accuracy of DINOv2 with the language understanding of CLIP. Our approach aligns the textual embeddings of CLIP to the patch-level features of DINOv2 through a learned mapping function without the need to fine-tune the underlying backbones. At training time, we exploit the attention maps of DINOv2 to selectively align local visual patches with textual embeddings. We show that the powerful semantic and localization abilities of Talk2DINO can enhance the segmentation process, resulting in more natural and less noisy segmentations, and that our approach can also effectively distinguish foreground objects from the background. Experimental results demonstrate that Talk2DINO achieves state-of-the-art performance across several unsupervised OVS benchmarks. Source code and models are publicly available at: https://lorebianchi98.github.io/Talk2DINO/.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computational pathology have produced patch-level Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), but these models are limited by their inability to analyze whole slide images (WSIs) comprehensively and their tendency to bypass crucial morphological features that pathologists rely on for diagnosis. To address these challenges, we first introduce WSI-Bench, a large-scale morphology-aware benchmark containing 180k VQA pairs from 9,850 WSIs across 30 cancer types, designed to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of morphological characteristics crucial for accurate diagnosis. Building upon this benchmark, we present WSI-LLaVA, a novel framework for gigapixel WSI understanding that employs a three-stage training approach: WSI-text alignment, feature space alignment, and task-specific instruction tuning. To better assess model performance in pathological contexts, we develop two specialized WSI metrics: WSI-Precision and WSI-Relevance. Experimental results demonstrate that WSI-LLaVA outperforms existing models across all capability dimensions, with a significant improvement in morphological analysis, establishing a clear correlation between morphological understanding and diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) have emerged as a bio-inspired alternative to traditional cameras, offering advantages in power efficiency, temporal resolution, and high dynamic range. However, the development of image analysis methods for EBCs is challenging due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of the data. This work addresses the problem of object detection for EBC cameras. The current approaches to EBC object detection focus on constructing complex data representations and rely on specialized architectures. We introduce I2EvDet (Image-to-Event Detection), a novel adaptation framework that bridges mainstream object detection with temporal event data processing. First, we demonstrate that a Real-Time DEtection TRansformer, or RT-DETR, a state-of-the-art natural image detector, trained on a simple image-like representation of the EBC data achieves performance comparable to specialized EBC methods. Next, as part of our framework, we develop an efficient adaptation technique that transforms image-based detectors into event-based detection models by modifying their frozen latent representation space through minimal architectural additions. The resulting EvRT-DETR model reaches state-of-the-art performance on the standard benchmark datasets Gen1 (mAP $+2.3$) and 1Mpx/Gen4 (mAP $+1.4$). These results demonstrate a fundamentally new approach to EBC object detection through principled adaptation of mainstream architectures, offering an efficient alternative with potential applications to other temporal visual domains.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have recently gained widespread adoption. This has spurred concerns about safeguarding intellectual property rights and an increasing demand for mechanisms that prevent the generation of specific artistic styles. Existing methods for style extraction typically necessitate the collection of custom datasets and the training of specialized models. This, however, is resource-intensive, time-consuming, and often impractical for real-time applications. We present a novel, training-free framework to solve the style attribution problem, using the features produced by a diffusion model alone, without any external modules or retraining. This is denoted as Introspective Style attribution (IntroStyle) and is shown to have superior performance to state-of-the-art models for style attribution. We also introduce a synthetic dataset of Artistic Style Split (ArtSplit) to isolate artistic style and evaluate fine-grained style attribution performance. Our experimental results on WikiArt and DomainNet datasets show that \ours is robust to the dynamic nature of artistic styles, outperforming existing methods by a wide margin.

Abstract: An image may convey a thousand words, but a video composed of hundreds or thousands of image frames tells a more intricate story. Despite significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), generating extended videos remains a formidable challenge. As of this writing, OpenAI's Sora, the current state-of-the-art system, is still limited to producing videos that are up to one minute in length. This limitation stems from the complexity of long video generation, which requires more than generative AI techniques for approximating density functions essential aspects such as planning, story development, and maintaining spatial and temporal consistency present additional hurdles. Integrating generative AI with a divide-and-conquer approach could improve scalability for longer videos while offering greater control. In this survey, we examine the current landscape of long video generation, covering foundational techniques like GANs and diffusion models, video generation strategies, large-scale training datasets, quality metrics for evaluating long videos, and future research areas to address the limitations of the existing video generation capabilities. We believe it would serve as a comprehensive foundation, offering extensive information to guide future advancements and research in the field of long video generation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is challenging due to the diversity of medical images and the lack of labeled data, which motivates recent developments in federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) to leverage a large amount of unlabeled data from multiple centers for model training without sharing raw data. However, what remains under-explored in FSSL is the domain shift problem which may cause suboptimal model aggregation and low effectivity of the utilization of unlabeled data, eventually leading to unsatisfactory performance in unseen domains. In this paper, we explore this previously ignored scenario, namely domain generalized federated semi-supervised learning (FedSemiDG), which aims to learn a model in a distributed manner from multiple domains with limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data such that the model can generalize well to unseen domains. We present a novel framework, Federated Generalization-Aware SemiSupervised Learning (FGASL), to address the challenges in FedSemiDG by effectively tackling critical issues at both global and local levels. Globally, we introduce Generalization-Aware Aggregation (GAA), assigning adaptive weights to local models based on their generalization performance. Locally, we use a Dual-Teacher Adaptive Pseudo Label Refinement (DR) strategy to combine global and domain-specific knowledge, generating more reliable pseudo labels. Additionally, Perturbation-Invariant Alignment (PIA) enforces feature consistency under perturbations, promoting domain-invariant learning. Extensive experiments on four medical segmentation tasks (cardiac MRI, spine MRI, bladder cancer MRI and colorectal polyp) demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art FSSL and domain generalization approaches, achieving robust generalization on unseen domains.

Next, to overcome the identified limitations, we introduce CHIRP - a new long form response benchmark we developed for more robust and complete VLM evaluation. We provide open access to the Robin training code, model suite, and CHIRP benchmark to promote reproducibility and advance VLM research.

Abstract: After pre-training on extensive image-text pairs, Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) demonstrates promising performance on a wide variety of benchmarks. However, a substantial volume of multimodal interleaved documents remains underutilized for contrastive vision-language representation learning. To fully leverage these unpaired documents, we initially establish a Real-World Data Extraction pipeline to extract high-quality images and texts. Then we design a hierarchical retrieval method to efficiently associate each image with multiple semantically relevant realistic texts. To further enhance fine-grained visual information, we propose an image semantic augmented generation module for synthetic text production. Furthermore, we employ a semantic balance sampling strategy to improve dataset diversity, enabling better learning of long-tail concepts. Based on these innovations, we construct RealSyn, a dataset combining realistic and synthetic texts, available in three scales: 15M, 30M, and 100M. We compare our dataset with other widely used datasets of equivalent scale for CLIP training. Models pre-trained on RealSyn consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks, including linear probe, zero-shot transfer, zero-shot robustness, and zero-shot retrieval. Furthermore, extensive experiments confirm that RealSyn significantly enhances contrastive vision-language representation learning and demonstrates robust scalability. To facilitate future research, the RealSyn dataset and pretrained model weights are released at https://github.com/deepglint/RealSyn.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal reasoning capabilities, but they remain susceptible to hallucination, particularly object hallucination where non-existent objects or incorrect attributes are fabricated in generated descriptions. Existing detection methods achieve strong performance but rely heavily on expensive API calls and iterative LVLM-based validation, making them impractical for large-scale or offline use. To address these limitations, we propose CutPaste\&amp;Find, a lightweight and training-free framework for detecting hallucinations in LVLM-generated outputs. Our approach leverages off-the-shelf visual and linguistic modules to perform multi-step verification efficiently without requiring LVLM inference. At the core of our framework is a Visual-aid Knowledge Base that encodes rich entity-attribute relationships and associated image representations. We introduce a scaling factor to refine similarity scores, mitigating the issue of suboptimal alignment values even for ground-truth image-text pairs. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including POPE and R-Bench, demonstrate that CutPaste\&amp;Find achieves competitive hallucination detection performance while being significantly more efficient and cost-effective than previous methods.

Abstract: Developing interpretable models for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) diagnosis presents significant challenges in effectively encoding, decoding, and integrating multimodal neuroimaging data. While many existing machine learning approaches have shown promise in brain network analysis, they typically suffer from limited interpretability, particularly in extracting meaningful biomarkers from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and establishing clear relationships between imaging features and demographic characteristics. Besides, current graph neural network methodologies face limitations in capturing both local and global functional connectivity patterns while simultaneously achieving theoretically principled multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (I2B-HGNN), a unified framework that applies information bottleneck principles to guide both brain connectivity modeling and cross-modal feature integration. This framework comprises two complementary components. The first is the Information Bottleneck Graph Transformer (IBGraphFormer), which combines transformer-based global attention mechanisms with graph neural networks through information bottleneck-guided pooling to identify sufficient biomarkers. The second is the Information Bottleneck Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (IB-HGAN), which employs meta-path-based heterogeneous graph learning with structural consistency constraints to achieve interpretable fusion of neuroimaging and demographic data. The experimental results demonstrate that I2B-HGNN achieves superior performance in diagnosing NDDs, exhibiting both high classification accuracy and the ability to provide interpretable biomarker identification while effectively analyzing non-imaging data.

Abstract: Image quality plays an important role in the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) that have been widely shown to exhibit sensitivity to changes in imaging conditions. Conventional image quality assessment (IQA) seeks to measure and align quality relative to human perceptual judgments, but we often need a metric that is not only sensitive to imaging conditions but also well-aligned with DNN sensitivities. We first ask whether conventional IQA metrics are also informative of DNN performance. We show theoretically and empirically that conventional IQA metrics are weak predictors of DNN performance for image classification. Using our causal framework, we then develop metrics that exhibit strong correlation with DNN performance, thus enabling us to effectively estimate the quality distribution of large image datasets relative to targeted vision tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has exhibited impressive generation capabilities but faces great challenges due to its high computational complexity. To address this issue, various methods, notably feature caching, have been introduced. However, these approaches focus on aligning non-cache diffusion without analyzing why caching damage the generation processes. In this paper, we first confirm that the cache greatly amplifies the exposure bias, resulting in a decline in the generation quality. However, directly applying noise scaling is challenging for this issue due to the non-smoothness of exposure bias. We found that this phenomenon stems from the mismatch between its frequency response characteristics and the simple cache of Attention and MLP. Since these two components exhibit unique preferences for frequency signals, which provides us with a caching strategy to separate Attention and MLP to achieve an enhanced fit of exposure bias and reduce it. Based on this, we introduced FEB-Cache, a joint caching strategy that aligns with the non-exposed bias diffusion process (which gives us a higher performance cap) of caching Attention and MLP based on the frequency-guided cache table. Our approach combines a comprehensive understanding of the caching mechanism and offers a new perspective on leveraging caching to accelerate the diffusion process. Empirical results indicate that FEB-Cache optimizes model performance while concurrently facilitating acceleration.

Abstract: Flow-based Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art image generation performance, but often suffer from high inference latency and computational cost due to their large parameter sizes. To improve inference efficiency without compromising quality, we propose Bridged Progressive Rectified Flow Transformers (NAMI), which decompose the generation process across temporal, spatial, and architectural demensions. We divide the rectified flow into different stages according to resolution, and use a BridgeFlow module to connect them. Fewer Transformer layers are used at low-resolution stages to generate image layouts and concept contours, and more layers are progressively added as the resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves fast convergence and reduces inference time while ensuring generation quality. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: (1) We introduce Bridged Progressive Rectified Flow Transformers that enable multi-resolution training, accelerating model convergence; (2) NAMI leverages piecewise flow and spatial cascading of Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to rapidly generate images, reducing inference time by 64% for generating 1024 resolution images; (3) We propose a BridgeFlow module to align flows between different stages; (4) We propose the NAMI-1K benchmark to evaluate human preference performance, aiming to mitigate distributional bias and comprehensively assess model effectiveness. The results show that our model is competitive with state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Fitting a body to a 3D clothed human point cloud is a common yet challenging task. Traditional optimization-based approaches use multi-stage pipelines that are sensitive to pose initialization, while recent learning-based methods often struggle with generalization across diverse poses and garment types. We propose Equivariant Tightness Fitting for Clothed Humans, or ETCH, a novel pipeline that estimates cloth-to-body surface mapping through locally approximate SE(3) equivariance, encoding tightness as displacement vectors from the cloth surface to the underlying body. Following this mapping, pose-invariant body features regress sparse body markers, simplifying clothed human fitting into an inner-body marker fitting task. Extensive experiments on CAPE and 4D-Dress show that ETCH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods -- both tightness-agnostic and tightness-aware -- in body fitting accuracy on loose clothing (16.7% ~ 69.5%) and shape accuracy (average 49.9%). Our equivariant tightness design can even reduce directional errors by (67.2% ~ 89.8%) in one-shot (or out-of-distribution) settings (~ 1% data). Qualitative results demonstrate strong generalization of ETCH, regardless of challenging poses, unseen shapes, loose clothing, and non-rigid dynamics. We will release the code and models soon for research purposes at https://boqian-li.github.io/ETCH/.

Abstract: The motion transfer task aims to transfer motion from a source video to newly generated videos, requiring the model to decouple motion from appearance. Previous diffusion-based methods primarily rely on separate spatial and temporal attention mechanisms within the 3D U-Net. In contrast, state-of-the-art video Diffusion Transformers (DiT) models use 3D full attention, which does not explicitly separate temporal and spatial information. Thus, the interaction between spatial and temporal dimensions makes decoupling motion and appearance more challenging for DiT models. In this paper, we propose DeT, a method that adapts DiT models to improve motion transfer ability. Our approach introduces a simple yet effective temporal kernel to smooth DiT features along the temporal dimension, facilitating the decoupling of foreground motion from background appearance. Meanwhile, the temporal kernel effectively captures temporal variations in DiT features, which are closely related to motion. Moreover, we introduce explicit supervision along dense trajectories in the latent feature space to further enhance motion consistency. Additionally, we present MTBench, a general and challenging benchmark for motion transfer. We also introduce a hybrid motion fidelity metric that considers both the global and local motion similarity. Therefore, our work provides a more comprehensive evaluation than previous works. Extensive experiments on MTBench demonstrate that DeT achieves the best trade-off between motion fidelity and edit fidelity.

Abstract: Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps transform the scene, and how evolving scene transformations can influence the sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Existing work has studied procedure-aware video representations by modeling the temporal order of actions, but has not explicitly learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change descriptions generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) as supervision signals for video encoders. Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining unseen "What if" scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. We conduct extensive experiments on procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection, action phase classification, frame retrieval, multi-instance retrieval, and action recognition. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant improvements on multiple tasks.

Abstract: This paper explores the task of Complex Visual Text Generation (CVTG), which centers on generating intricate textual content distributed across diverse regions within visual images. In CVTG, image generation models often rendering distorted and blurred visual text or missing some visual text. To tackle these challenges, we propose TextCrafter, a novel multi-visual text rendering method. TextCrafter employs a progressive strategy to decompose complex visual text into distinct components while ensuring robust alignment between textual content and its visual carrier. Additionally, it incorporates a token focus enhancement mechanism to amplify the prominence of visual text during the generation process. TextCrafter effectively addresses key challenges in CVTG tasks, such as text confusion, omissions, and blurriness. Moreover, we present a new benchmark dataset, CVTG-2K, tailored to rigorously evaluate the performance of generative models on CVTG tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Omnidirectional depth perception is essential for mobile robotics applications that require scene understanding across a full 360{\deg} field of view. Camera-based setups offer a cost-effective option by using stereo depth estimation to generate dense, high-resolution depth maps without relying on expensive active sensing. However, existing omnidirectional stereo matching approaches achieve only limited depth accuracy across diverse environments, depth ranges, and lighting conditions, due to the scarcity of real-world data. We present DFI-OmniStereo, a novel omnidirectional stereo matching method that leverages a large-scale pre-trained foundation model for relative monocular depth estimation within an iterative optimization-based stereo matching architecture. We introduce a dedicated two-stage training strategy to utilize the relative monocular depth features for our omnidirectional stereo matching before scale-invariant fine-tuning. DFI-OmniStereo achieves state-of-the-art results on the real-world Helvipad dataset, reducing disparity MAE by approximately 16% compared to the previous best omnidirectional stereo method.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting enables high-quality novel view synthesis (NVS) at real-time frame rates. However, its quality drops sharply as we depart from the training views. Thus, dense captures are needed to match the high-quality expectations of applications like Virtual Reality (VR). However, such dense captures are very laborious and expensive to obtain. Existing works have explored using 2D generative models to alleviate this requirement by distillation or generating additional training views. These models typically rely on a noise-to-data generative process conditioned only on a handful of reference input views, leading to hallucinations, inconsistent generation results, and subsequent reconstruction artifacts. Instead, we propose a multi-view, flow matching model that learns a flow to directly connect novel view renderings from possibly sparse reconstructions to renderings that we expect from dense reconstructions. This enables augmenting scene captures with consistent, generated views to improve reconstruction quality. Our model is trained on a novel dataset of 3.6M image pairs and can process up to 45 views at 540x960 resolution (91K tokens) on one H100 GPU in a single forward pass. Our pipeline consistently improves NVS in sparse- and dense-view scenarios, leading to higher-quality reconstructions than prior works across multiple, widely-used NVS benchmarks.

Abstract: Single-photon Lidar imaging offers a significant advantage in 3D imaging due to its high resolution and long-range capabilities, however it is challenging to apply in noisy environments with multiple targets per pixel. To tackle these challenges, several methods have been proposed. Statistical methods demonstrate interpretability on the inferred parameters, but they are often limited in their ability to handle complex scenes. Deep learning-based methods have shown superior performance in terms of accuracy and robustness, but they lack interpretability or they are limited to a single-peak per pixel. In this paper, we propose a deep unrolling algorithm for dual-peak single-photon Lidar imaging. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian model for multiple targets and propose a neural network that unrolls the underlying statistical method. To support multiple targets, we adopt a dual depth maps representation and exploit geometric deep learning to extract features from the point cloud. The proposed method takes advantages of statistical methods and learning-based methods in terms of accuracy and quantifying uncertainty. The experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate the competitive performance when compared to existing methods, while also providing uncertainty information.

<title>Prior2Former -- Evidential Modeling of Mask Transformers for Assumption-Free Open-World Panoptic Segmentation</title>

Abstract: In panoptic segmentation, individual instances must be separated within semantic classes. As state-of-the-art methods rely on a pre-defined set of classes, they struggle with novel categories and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. This is particularly problematic in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, where reliability in unseen scenarios is essential. We address the gap between outstanding benchmark performance and reliability by proposing Prior2Former (P2F), the first approach for segmentation vision transformers rooted in evidential learning. P2F extends the mask vision transformer architecture by incorporating a Beta prior for computing model uncertainty in pixel-wise binary mask assignments. This design enables high-quality uncertainty estimation that effectively detects novel and OOD objects enabling state-of-the-art anomaly instance segmentation and open-world panoptic segmentation. Unlike most segmentation models addressing unknown classes, P2F operates without access to OOD data samples or contrastive training on void (i.e., unlabeled) classes, making it highly applicable in real-world scenarios where such prior information is unavailable. Additionally, P2F can be flexibly applied to anomaly instance and panoptic segmentation. Through comprehensive experiments on the Cityscapes, COCO, SegmentMeIfYouCan, and OoDIS datasets, P2F demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across the board.

Abstract: Do we still need to represent objects explicitly in multimodal large language models (MLLMs)? To one extreme, pre-trained encoders convert images into visual tokens, with which objects and spatiotemporal relationships may be implicitly modeled. To the other extreme, image captions by themselves provide strong empirical performances for understanding tasks, despite missing fine-grained spatiotemporal information. To answer this question, we introduce ObjectMLLM, a framework capable of leveraging arbitrary computer vision algorithm to extract and integrate structured visual representation. Through extensive evaluations on six video question answering benchmarks, we confirm that explicit integration of object-centric representation remains necessary. Surprisingly, we observe that the simple approach of quantizing the continuous, structured object information and representing them as plain text performs the best, offering a data-efficient approach to integrate other visual perception modules into MLLM design. Our code and models are released at https://github.com/brown-palm/ObjectMLLM.

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) play a crucial role in underwater exploration. Vision-based methods offer cost-effective solutions for localization and mapping in the absence of conventional sensors like GPS and LiDAR. However, underwater environments present significant challenges for feature extraction and matching due to image blurring and noise caused by attenuation, scattering, and the interference of \textit{marine snow}. In this paper, we aim to improve the robustness of the feature extraction and matching in the turbid underwater environment using the cross-modal knowledge distillation method that transfers the in-air feature extraction and matching models to underwater settings using synthetic underwater images as the medium. We first propose a novel adaptive GAN-synthesis method to estimate water parameters and underwater noise distribution, to generate environment-specific synthetic underwater images. We then introduce a general knowledge distillation framework compatible with different teacher models. The evaluation of GAN-based synthesis highlights the significance of the new components, i.e. GAN-synthesized noise and forward scattering, in the proposed model. Additionally, VSLAM, as a representative downstream application of feature extraction and matching, is employed on real underwater sequences to validate the effectiveness of the transferred model.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration (AIR) aims to address diverse degradations within a unified model by leveraging informative degradation conditions to guide the restoration process. However, existing methods often rely on implicitly learned priors, which may entangle feature representations and hinder performance in complex or unseen scenarios. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) as a classical gradient representation, we observe that it has strong discriminative capability across diverse degradations, making it a powerful and interpretable prior for AIR. Based on this insight, we propose HOGformer, a Transformer-based model that integrates learnable HOG features for degradation-aware restoration. The core of HOGformer is a Dynamic HOG-aware Self-Attention (DHOGSA) mechanism, which adaptively models long-range spatial dependencies conditioned on degradation-specific cues encoded by HOG descriptors. To further adapt the heterogeneity of degradations in AIR, we propose a Dynamic Interaction Feed-Forward (DIFF) module that facilitates channel-spatial interactions, enabling robust feature transformation under diverse degradations. Besides, we propose a HOG loss to explicitly enhance structural fidelity and edge sharpness. Extensive experiments on a variety of benchmarks, including adverse weather and natural degradations, demonstrate that HOGformer achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes well to complex real-world scenarios.Code is available at https://github.com/Fire-friend/HOGformer.

Abstract: The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) framework has become a widely used approach for multimodal representation learning, particularly in image-text retrieval and clustering. However, its efficacy is constrained by three key limitations: (1) text token truncation, (2) isolated image-text encoding, and (3) deficient compositionality due to bag-of-words behavior. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant advances in generalized vision-language understanding, their potential for learning transferable multimodal representations remains underexplored.In this work, we present UniME (Universal Multimodal Embedding), a novel two-stage framework that leverages MLLMs to learn discriminative representations for diverse downstream tasks. In the first stage, we perform textual discriminative knowledge distillation from a powerful LLM-based teacher model to enhance the embedding capability of the MLLM\'s language component. In the second stage, we introduce hard negative enhanced instruction tuning to further advance discriminative representation learning. Specifically, we initially mitigate false negative contamination and then sample multiple hard negatives per instance within each batch, forcing the model to focus on challenging samples. This approach not only improves discriminative power but also enhances instruction-following ability in downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and multiple retrieval tasks, including short and long caption retrieval and compositional retrieval. Results demonstrate that UniME achieves consistent performance improvement across all tasks, exhibiting superior discriminative and compositional capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid advancement in generative artificial intelligence have enabled the creation of 3D human faces (HFs) for applications including media production, virtual reality, security, healthcare, and game development, etc. However, assessing the quality and realism of these AI-generated 3D human faces remains a significant challenge due to the subjective nature of human perception and innate perceptual sensitivity to facial features. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive study on the quality assessment of AI-generated 3D human faces. We first introduce Gen3DHF, a large-scale benchmark comprising 2,000 videos of AI-Generated 3D Human Faces along with 4,000 Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) collected across two dimensions, i.e., quality and authenticity, 2,000 distortion-aware saliency maps and distortion descriptions. Based on Gen3DHF, we propose LMME3DHF, a Large Multimodal Model (LMM)-based metric for Evaluating 3DHF capable of quality and authenticity score prediction, distortion-aware visual question answering, and distortion-aware saliency prediction. Experimental results show that LMME3DHF achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods in both accurately predicting quality scores for AI-generated 3D human faces and effectively identifying distortion-aware salient regions and distortion types, while maintaining strong alignment with human perceptual judgments. Both the Gen3DHF database and the LMME3DHF will be released upon the publication.

Abstract: We present JointDiT, a diffusion transformer that models the joint distribution of RGB and depth. By leveraging the architectural benefit and outstanding image prior of the state-of-the-art diffusion transformer, JointDiT not only generates high-fidelity images but also produces geometrically plausible and accurate depth maps. This solid joint distribution modeling is achieved through two simple yet effective techniques that we propose, namely, adaptive scheduling weights, which depend on the noise levels of each modality, and the unbalanced timestep sampling strategy. With these techniques, we train our model across all noise levels for each modality, enabling JointDiT to naturally handle various combinatorial generation tasks, including joint generation, depth estimation, and depth-conditioned image generation by simply controlling the timesteps of each branch. JointDiT demonstrates outstanding joint generation performance. Furthermore, it achieves comparable results in depth estimation and depth-conditioned image generation, suggesting that joint distribution modeling can serve as a viable alternative to conditional generation.

Abstract: Scene text editing aims to modify or add texts on images while ensuring text fidelity and overall visual quality consistent with the background. Recent methods are primarily built on UNet-based diffusion models, which have improved scene text editing results, but still struggle with complex glyph structures, especially for non-Latin ones (\eg, Chinese, Korean, Japanese). To address these issues, we present \textbf{FLUX-Text}, a simple and advanced multilingual scene text editing DiT method. Specifically, our FLUX-Text enhances glyph understanding and generation through lightweight Visual and Text Embedding Modules, while preserving the original generative capability of FLUX. We further propose a Regional Text Perceptual Loss tailored for text regions, along with a matching two-stage training strategy to better balance text editing and overall image quality. Benefiting from the DiT-based architecture and lightweight feature injection modules, FLUX-Text can be trained with only $0.1$M training examples, a \textbf{97\%} reduction compared to $2.9$M required by popular methods. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets, including English and Chinese benchmarks, demonstrate that our method surpasses other methods in visual quality and text fidelity.

Abstract: Event cameras excel in high temporal resolution and dynamic range but suffer from dense noise in rainy conditions. Existing event deraining methods face trade-offs between temporal precision, deraining effectiveness, and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose PRE-Mamba, a novel point-based event camera deraining framework that fully exploits the spatiotemporal characteristics of raw event and rain. Our framework introduces a 4D event cloud representation that integrates dual temporal scales to preserve high temporal precision, a Spatio-Temporal Decoupling and Fusion module (STDF) that enhances deraining capability by enabling shallow decoupling and interaction of temporal and spatial information, and a Multi-Scale State Space Model (MS3M) that captures deeper rain dynamics across dual-temporal and multi-spatial scales with linear computational complexity. Enhanced by frequency-domain regularization, PRE-Mamba achieves superior performance (0.95 SR, 0.91 NR, and 0.4s/M events) with only 0.26M parameters on EventRain-27K, a comprehensive dataset with labeled synthetic and real-world sequences. Moreover, our method generalizes well across varying rain intensities, viewpoints, and even snowy conditions.

Abstract: Modern automotive infotainment systems necessitate intelligent and adaptive solutions to manage frequent User Interface (UI) updates and diverse design variations. This work introduces a vision-language framework to facilitate the understanding of and interaction with automotive UIs, enabling seamless adaptation across different UI designs. To support research in this field, AutomotiveUI-Bench-4K, an open-source dataset comprising 998 images with 4,208 annotations, is also released. Additionally, a data pipeline for generating training data is presented. A Molmo-7B-based model is fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRa), incorporating generated reasoning along with visual grounding and evaluation capabilities. The fine-tuned Evaluative Large Action Model (ELAM) achieves strong performance on AutomotiveUI-Bench-4K (model and dataset are available on Hugging Face). The approach demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization, including a +5.6% improvement on ScreenSpot over the baseline model. An average accuracy of 80.8% is achieved on ScreenSpot, closely matching or surpassing specialized models for desktop, mobile, and web, despite being trained primarily on the automotive domain. This research investigates how data collection and subsequent fine-tuning can lead to AI-driven advancements in automotive UI understanding and interaction. The applied method is cost-efficient, and fine-tuned models can be deployed on consumer-grade GPUs.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has demonstrated capabilities across various domains, but comprehensive benchmarks for agricultural remote sensing (RS) remain scarce. Existing benchmarks designed for agricultural RS scenarios exhibit notable limitations, primarily in terms of insufficient scene diversity in the dataset and oversimplified task design. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgroMind, a comprehensive agricultural remote sensing benchmark covering four task dimensions: spatial perception, object understanding, scene understanding, and scene reasoning, with a total of 13 task types, ranging from crop identification and health monitoring to environmental analysis. We curate a high-quality evaluation set by integrating eight public datasets and one private farmland plot dataset, containing 27,247 QA pairs and 19,615 images. The pipeline begins with multi-source data pre-processing, including collection, format standardization, and annotation refinement. We then generate a diverse set of agriculturally relevant questions through the systematic definition of tasks. Finally, we employ LMMs for inference, generating responses, and performing detailed examinations. We evaluated 20 open-source LMMs and 4 closed-source models on AgroMind. Experiments reveal significant performance gaps, particularly in spatial reasoning and fine-grained recognition, it is notable that human performance lags behind several leading LMMs. By establishing a standardized evaluation framework for agricultural RS, AgroMind reveals the limitations of LMMs in domain knowledge and highlights critical challenges for future work.

Abstract: Personalizing 3D scenes from a single reference image enables intuitive user-guided editing, which requires achieving both multi-view consistency across perspectives and referential consistency with the input image. However, these goals are particularly challenging due to the viewpoint bias caused by the limited perspective provided in a single image. Lacking the mechanisms to effectively expand reference information beyond the original view, existing methods of image-conditioned 3DGS personalization often suffer from this viewpoint bias and struggle to produce consistent results. Therefore, in this paper, we present Consistent Personalization for 3D Gaussian Splatting (CP-GS), a framework that progressively propagates the single-view reference appearance to novel perspectives. In particular, CP-GS integrates pre-trained image-to-3D generation and iterative LoRA fine-tuning to extract and extend the reference appearance, and finally produces faithful multi-view guidance images and the personalized 3DGS outputs through a view-consistent generation process guided by geometric cues. Extensive experiments on real-world scenes show that our CP-GS effectively mitigates the viewpoint bias, achieving high-quality personalization that significantly outperforms existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/Yuxuan-W/CP-GS.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Multi-modality Large Language Models (MLLMs) is driving significant advancements in visual understanding and generation. Nevertheless, a comprehensive assessment of their capabilities, concerning the fine-grained physical principles especially in geometric optics, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GOBench, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs' ability across two tasks: 1) Generating Optically Authentic Imagery and 2) Understanding Underlying Optical Phenomena. We curates high-quality prompts of geometric optical scenarios and use MLLMs to construct GOBench-Gen-1k dataset.We then organize subjective experiments to assess the generated imagery based on Optical Authenticity, Aesthetic Quality, and Instruction Fidelity, revealing MLLMs' generation flaws that violate optical principles. For the understanding task, we apply crafted evaluation instructions to test optical understanding ability of eleven prominent MLLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that current models face significant challenges in both optical generation and understanding. The top-performing generative model, GPT-4o-Image, cannot perfectly complete all generation tasks, and the best-performing MLLM model, Gemini-2.5Pro, attains a mere 37.35\% accuracy in optical understanding. Database and codes are publicly available at https://github.com/aiben-ch/GOBench.

The task of CS Video-to-Speech generation (CSV2S) aims to convert CS videos into intelligible speech signals. Most existing research focuses on CS Recognition (CSR), which transcribes video content into text. Consequently, a common solution for CSV2S is to integrate CSR with a text-to-speech (TTS) system. However, this pipeline relies on text as an intermediate medium, which may lead to error propagation and temporal misalignment between speech and CS video dynamics. In contrast, directly generating audio speech from CS video (direct CSV2S) often suffers from the inherent multimodal complexity and the limited availability of CS data. To address these challenges, we propose UniCUE, the first unified framework for CSV2S that directly generates speech from CS videos without relying on intermediate text. The core innovation of UniCUE lies in integrating an understanding task (CSR) that provides fine-grained CS visual-semantic cues to guide speech generation. Specifically, UniCUE incorporates a pose-aware visual processor, a semantic alignment pool that enables precise visual-semantic mapping, and a VisioPhonetic adapter to bridge the understanding and generation tasks within a unified architecture. To support this framework, we construct UniCUE-HI, a large-scale Mandarin CS dataset containing 11282 videos from 14 cuers, including both hearing-impaired and normal-hearing individuals. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate that UniCUE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric inconsistency.

Abstract: We introduce EASG-Bench, a question-answering benchmark for egocentric videos where the question-answering pairs are created from spatio-temporally grounded dynamic scene graphs capturing intricate relationships among actors, actions, and objects. We propose a systematic evaluation framework and evaluate several language-only and video large language models (video-LLMs) on this benchmark. We observe a performance gap in language-only and video-LLMs, especially on questions focusing on temporal ordering, thus identifying a research gap in the area of long-context video understanding.

Abstract: Real-world object detection is a challenging task where the captured images/videos often suffer from complex degradations due to various adverse weather conditions such as rain, fog, snow, low-light, etc. Despite extensive prior efforts, most existing methods are designed for one specific type of adverse weather with constraints of poor generalization, under-utilization of visual features while handling various image degradations. Leveraging a theoretical analysis on how critical visual details are lost in adverse-weather images, we design UniDet-D, a unified framework that tackles the challenge of object detection under various adverse weather conditions, and achieves object detection and image restoration within a single network. Specifically, the proposed UniDet-D incorporates a dynamic spectral attention mechanism that adaptively emphasizes informative spectral components while suppressing irrelevant ones, enabling more robust and discriminative feature representation across various degradation types. Extensive experiments show that UniDet-D achieves superior detection accuracy across different types of adverse-weather degradation. Furthermore, UniDet-D demonstrates superior generalization towards unseen adverse weather conditions such as sandstorms and rain-fog mixtures, highlighting its great potential for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models for video understanding (videoLLMs) have enhanced their capacity to process complex spatiotemporal data. However, challenges such as factual inaccuracies, harmful content, biases, hallucinations, and privacy risks compromise their reliability. This study introduces Trust-videoLLMs, a first comprehensive benchmark evaluating 23 state-of-the-art videoLLMs (5 commercial, 18 open-source) across five critical dimensions: truthfulness, robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy. Comprising 30 tasks with adapted, synthetic, and annotated videos, the framework assesses spatiotemporal risks, temporal consistency and cross-modal impact. Results reveal significant limitations in dynamic scene comprehension, cross-modal perturbation resilience and real-world risk mitigation. While open-source models occasionally outperform, proprietary models generally exhibit superior credibility, though scaling does not consistently improve performance. These findings underscore the need for enhanced training datat diversity and robust multimodal alignment. Trust-videoLLMs provides a publicly available, extensible toolkit for standardized trustworthiness assessments, addressing the critical gap between accuracy-focused benchmarks and demands for robustness, safety, fairness, and privacy.

Abstract: Adapting text-to-image (T2I) latent diffusion models (LDMs) to video editing has shown strong visual fidelity and controllability, but challenges remain in maintaining causal relationships inherent to the video data generating process. Edits affecting causally dependent attributes often generate unrealistic or misleading outcomes if these relationships are ignored. In this work, we introduce a causally faithful framework for counterfactual video generation, formulated as an Out-of-Distribution (OOD) prediction problem. We embed prior causal knowledge by encoding the relationships specified in a causal graph into text prompts and guide the generation process by optimizing these prompts using a vision-language model (VLM)-based textual loss. This loss encourages the latent space of the LDMs to capture OOD variations in the form of counterfactuals, effectively steering generation toward causally meaningful alternatives. The proposed framework, dubbed CSVC, is agnostic to the underlying video editing system and does not require access to its internal mechanisms or fine-tuning. We evaluate our approach using standard video quality metrics and counterfactual-specific criteria, such as causal effectiveness and minimality. Experimental results show that CSVC generates causally faithful video counterfactuals within the LDM distribution via prompt-based causal steering, achieving state-of-the-art causal effectiveness without compromising temporal consistency or visual quality on real-world facial videos. Due to its compatibility with any black-box video editing system, our framework has significant potential to generate realistic 'what if' hypothetical video scenarios in diverse areas such as digital media and healthcare.

Abstract: An ideal traffic simulator replicates the realistic long-term point-to-point trip that a self-driving system experiences during deployment. Prior models and benchmarks focus on closed-loop motion simulation for initial agents in a scene. This is problematic for long-term simulation. Agents enter and exit the scene as the ego vehicle enters new regions. We propose InfGen, a unified next-token prediction model that performs interleaved closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation. InfGen automatically switches between closed-loop motion simulation and scene generation mode. It enables stable long-term rollout simulation. InfGen performs at the state-of-the-art in short-term (9s) traffic simulation, and significantly outperforms all other methods in long-term (30s) simulation. The code and model of InfGen will be released at https://orangesodahub.github.io/InfGen

Abstract: Current low-light image enhancement (LLIE) methods face significant limitations in simultaneously improving brightness while preserving semantic consistency, fine details, and computational efficiency. With the emergence of state-space models, particularly Mamba, image restoration has achieved remarkable performance, yet existing visual Mamba approaches flatten 2D images into 1D token sequences using fixed scanning rules, critically limiting interactions between distant tokens with causal relationships and constraining their ability to capture meaningful long-range dependencies. To address these fundamental limitations, we propose BSMamba, a novel visual Mamba architecture comprising two specially designed components: Brightness Mamba and Semantic Mamba. The Brightness Mamba revolutionizes token interaction patterns by prioritizing connections between distant tokens with similar brightness levels, effectively addressing the challenge of brightness restoration in LLIE tasks through brightness-guided selective attention. Complementing this, the Semantic Mamba establishes priority interactions between tokens sharing similar semantic meanings, allowing the model to maintain contextual consistency by connecting semantically related regions across the image, thus preserving the hierarchical nature of image semantics during enhancement. By intelligently modeling tokens based on brightness and semantic similarity rather than arbitrary scanning patterns, BSMamba transcends the constraints of conventional token sequencing while adhering to the principles of causal modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in LLIE while preserving semantic consistency. Code is available at https://github.com/bywlzts/BSMamba.

Abstract: Medical image recognition serves as a key way to aid in clinical diagnosis, enabling more accurate and timely identification of diseases and abnormalities. Vision transformer-based approaches have proven effective in handling various medical recognition tasks. However, these methods encounter two primary challenges. First, they are often task-specific and architecture-tailored, limiting their general applicability. Second, they usually either adopt full attention to model long-range dependencies, resulting in high computational costs, or rely on handcrafted sparse attention, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle these issues, we present MedFormer, an efficient medical vision transformer with two key ideas. First, it employs a pyramid scaling structure as a versatile backbone for various medical image recognition tasks, including image classification and dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation and lesion detection. This structure facilitates hierarchical feature representation while reducing the computation load of feature maps, highly beneficial for boosting performance. Second, it introduces a novel Dual Sparse Selection Attention (DSSA) with content awareness to improve computational efficiency and robustness against noise while maintaining high performance. As the core building technique of MedFormer, DSSA is designed to explicitly attend to the most relevant content. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that MedFormer outperforms existing medical vision transformers in terms of generality and efficiency. Extensive experiments across various imaging modality datasets show that MedFormer consistently enhances performance in all three medical image recognition tasks mentioned above. MedFormer provides an efficient and versatile solution for medical image recognition, with strong potential for clinical application.

Abstract: Most end-to-end autonomous driving methods rely on imitation learning from single expert demonstrations, often leading to conservative and homogeneous behaviors that limit generalization in complex real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DIVER, an end-to-end driving framework that integrates reinforcement learning with diffusion-based generation to produce diverse and feasible trajectories. At the core of DIVER lies a reinforced diffusion-based generation mechanism. First, the model conditions on map elements and surrounding agents to generate multiple reference trajectories from a single ground-truth trajectory, alleviating the limitations of imitation learning that arise from relying solely on single expert demonstrations. Second, reinforcement learning is employed to guide the diffusion process, where reward-based supervision enforces safety and diversity constraints on the generated trajectories, thereby enhancing their practicality and generalization capability. Furthermore, to address the limitations of L2-based open-loop metrics in capturing trajectory diversity, we propose a novel Diversity metric to evaluate the diversity of multi-mode predictions.Extensive experiments on the closed-loop NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks, as well as the open-loop nuScenes dataset, demonstrate that DIVER significantly improves trajectory diversity, effectively addressing the mode collapse problem inherent in imitation learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging paradigm of generative video coding for Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging powerful generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which tend to inadequately capture fine-grained motion details, leading to unrealistic or incoherent reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding (dubbed T-GVC), a novel framework that bridges low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding. T-GVC features a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline that extracts pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, significantly reducing the bitrate while preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by integrating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free guidance mechanism in latent space to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that T-GVC outperforms both traditional and neural video codecs under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our framework achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.

<title>Towards Imperceptible JPEG Image Hiding: Multi-range Representations-driven Adversarial Stego Generation</title>

Abstract: Image hiding fully explores the hidden potential of deep learning-based models, aiming to conceal image-level messages within cover images and reveal them from stego images to achieve covert communication. Existing hiding schemes are easily detected by the naked eyes or steganalyzers due to the cover type confined to the spatial domain, single-range feature extraction and attacks, and insufficient loss constraints. To address these issues, we propose a multi-range representations-driven adversarial stego generation framework called MRAG for JPEG image hiding. This design stems from the fact that steganalyzers typically combine local-range and global-range information to better capture hidden traces. Specifically, MRAG integrates the local-range characteristic of the convolution and the global-range modeling of the transformer. Meanwhile, a features angle-norm disentanglement loss is designed to launch multi-range representations-driven feature-level adversarial attacks. It computes the adversarial loss between covers and stegos based on the surrogate steganalyzer's classified features, i.e., the features before the last fully connected layer. Under the dual constraints of features angle and norm, MRAG can delicately encode the concatenation of cover and secret into subtle adversarial perturbations from local and global ranges relevant to steganalysis. Therefore, the resulting stego can achieve visual and steganalysis imperceptibility. Moreover, coarse-grained and fine-grained frequency decomposition operations are devised to transform the input, introducing multi-grained information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRAG can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image models have achieved remarkable results in synthesizing diverse images from text prompts and can capture specific artistic styles via style personalization. However, their entangled latent space and lack of smooth interpolation make it difficult to apply distinct painting techniques in a controlled, regional manner, often causing one style to dominate. To overcome this, we propose a zero-shot diffusion pipeline that naturally blends multiple styles by performing style composition on the denoised latents predicted during the flow-matching denoising process of separately trained, style-specialized models. We leverage the fact that lower-noise latents carry stronger stylistic information and fuse them across heterogeneous diffusion pipelines using spatial masks, enabling precise, region-specific style control. This mechanism preserves the fidelity of each individual style while allowing user-guided mixing. Furthermore, to ensure structural coherence across different models, we incorporate depth-map conditioning via ControlNet into the diffusion framework. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method successfully achieves region-specific style mixing according to the given masks.

Abstract: Modeling and rendering dynamic urban driving scenes is crucial for self-driving simulation. Current high-quality methods typically rely on costly manual object tracklet annotations, while self-supervised approaches fail to capture dynamic object motions accurately and decompose scenes properly, resulting in rendering artifacts. We introduce AD-GS, a novel self-supervised framework for high-quality free-viewpoint rendering of driving scenes from a single log. At its core is a novel learnable motion model that integrates locality-aware B-spline curves with global-aware trigonometric functions, enabling flexible yet precise dynamic object modeling. Rather than requiring comprehensive semantic labeling, AD-GS automatically segments scenes into objects and background with the simplified pseudo 2D segmentation, representing objects using dynamic Gaussians and bidirectional temporal visibility masks. Further, our model incorporates visibility reasoning and physically rigid regularization to enhance robustness. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our annotation-free model significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art annotation-free methods and is competitive with annotation-dependent approaches.

Abstract: Recent subject-driven image customization has achieved significant advancements in fidelity, yet fine-grained instance-level spatial control remains elusive, hindering broader real-world application. This limitation is mainly attributed to the absence of scalable datasets that bind identity with precise positional cues. To this end, we introduce PositionIC, a unified framework that enforces position and identity consistency for multi-subject customization. We construct a scalable synthesis pipeline that employs a bidirectional generation paradigm to eliminate subject drift and maintain semantic coherence. On top of these data, we design a lightweight positional modulation operation that decouples spatial embeddings among subjects, enabling independent, accurate placement while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve precise spatial control while maintaining high consistency in image customization tasks. PositionIC paves the way for controllable, high-fidelity image customization in open-world, multi-entity scenarios and will be released to foster further research.

Abstract: We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source (data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2, CLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training pipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and a subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in SSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to large codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to account for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we introduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on nested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features into increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size, enabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a novel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional biases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic content. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks, demonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions establish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and open a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for the broader AI community. The code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/valeoai/Franca.

However, the processing of long documents remains under-explored, largely due to a lack of suitable benchmarks. To address this, we introduce Document Haystack, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of Vision Language Models (VLMs) on long, visually complex documents. Document Haystack features documents ranging from 5 to 200 pages and strategically inserts pure text or multimodal text+image "needles" at various depths within the documents to challenge VLMs' retrieval capabilities. Comprising 400 document variants and a total of 8,250 questions, it is supported by an objective, automated evaluation framework. We detail the construction and characteristics of the Document Haystack dataset, present results from prominent VLMs and discuss potential research avenues in this area.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) delineation, the segmentation of meaningful waveform features, is critical for clinical diagnosis. Despite recent advances using deep learning, progress has been limited by the scarcity of publicly available annotated datasets. Semi-supervised learning presents a promising solution by leveraging abundant unlabeled ECG data. In this study, we present SemiSegECG, the first systematic benchmark for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SemiSeg) in ECG delineation. We curated and unified multiple public datasets, including previously underused sources, to support robust and diverse evaluation. We adopted five representative SemiSeg algorithms from computer vision, implemented them on two different architectures: the convolutional network and the transformer, and evaluated them in two different settings: in-domain and cross-domain. Additionally, we propose ECG-specific training configurations and augmentation strategies and introduce a standardized evaluation framework. Our results show that the transformer outperforms the convolutional network in semi-supervised ECG delineation. We anticipate that SemiSegECG will serve as a foundation for advancing semi-supervised ECG delineation methods and will facilitate further research in this domain.

Abstract: In this paper, we study a practical but less-touched problem in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \ie, negation understanding. Specifically, many real-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or non-existent, \eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific conditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale training, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation. To address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the scarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive data containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions demand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable widespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically observe that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the affirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related parameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in consistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in unrelated semantics. Extensive experiments on the various negation understanding tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Remarkably, with less than 0.01\% of trainable parameters, NEAT achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art post-training approaches. Our code is available at https://github.com/hhc1997/NEAT.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit impressive performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework, ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), that enables MLLMs to learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle, i.e., verifying the rendered output against the source image is substantially easier than performing deep visual reasoning to generate a faithful, structured representation such as code. We demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL), thereby reducing reliance on image-text supervision. RRVF implements a closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual feedback components, enabling the model to perform complex reasoning, including self-correction through multi-turn interactions. This process is optimized end-to-end using the GRPO algorithm. Extensive evaluations are conducted on image-to-code generation across two diverse domains: data charts and web interfaces. The RRVF-trained model not only outperforms existing similarly sized open-source MLLMs and supervised fine-tuning baselines but also exhibits superior generalization. Notably, the model outperforms the more advanced MLLM used to generate visual feedback during training. %only in arxiv Code is available at https://github.com/L-O-I/RRVF.

Abstract: We introduce Aether Weaver, a novel, integrated framework for multimodal narrative co-generation that overcomes limitations of sequential text-to-visual pipelines. Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency, further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and immersive storytelling experiences.

Abstract: Micro-Actions (MAs) are an important form of non-verbal communication in social interactions, with potential applications in human emotional analysis. However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level, facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions. Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification. Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion cues. The code will be available at https://github.com/momiji-bit/MMN.

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in scientific and medical imaging, but acquiring full-view sinograms requires high radiation dose and long scan times. Sparse-view CT alleviates this burden but yields incomplete sinograms with structured signal loss, hampering accurate reconstruction. Unlike RGB images, sinograms encode overlapping features along projection paths and exhibit directional spectral patterns. Standard inpainting models overlook these properties, treating missing data as local holes and neglecting angular dependencies and physical consistency. We propose~\modelname, a diffusion-based framework tailored for sinograms, which restores global structure through bidirectional frequency reasoning and angular-aware masking, while enforcing physical plausibility via physics-guided constraints and frequency-adaptive noise control. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that~\modelname~consistently outperforms baselines, achieving SSIM over 0.93 and PSNR above 31 dB across diverse sparse-view scenarios.

<title>Learning New Concepts, Remembering the Old: Continual Learning for Multimodal Concept Bottleneck Models</title>

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance the interpretability of AI systems, particularly by bridging visual input with human-understandable concepts, effectively acting as a form of multimodal interpretability model. However, existing CBMs typically assume static datasets, which fundamentally limits their adaptability to real-world, continuously evolving multimodal data streams. To address this, we define a novel continual learning task for CBMs: simultaneously handling concept-incremental and class-incremental learning. This task requires models to continuously acquire new concepts (often representing cross-modal attributes) and classes while robustly preserving previously learned knowledge. To tackle this challenging problem, we propose CONceptual Continual Incremental Learning (CONCIL), a novel framework that fundamentally re-imagines concept and decision layer updates as linear regression problems. This reformulation eliminates the need for gradient-based optimization, thereby effectively preventing catastrophic forgetting. Crucially, CONCIL relies solely on recursive matrix operations, rendering it highly computationally efficient and well-suited for real-time and large-scale multimodal data applications. Experimental results compellingly demonstrate that CONCIL achieves "absolute knowledge memory" and significantly surpasses the performance of traditional CBM methods in both concept- and class-incremental settings, thus establishing a new paradigm for continual learning in CBMs, particularly valuable for dynamic multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) significantly reduce computational complexity and memory usage in machine and deep learning by representing weights and activations with just one bit. However, most existing training algorithms for BNNs rely on quantization-aware floating-point Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), limiting the full exploitation of binary operations to the inference phase only. In this work, we propose, for the first time, a fully binary and gradient-free training algorithm for multi-layer BNNs, eliminating the need for back-propagated floating-point gradients. Specifically, the proposed algorithm relies on local binary error signals and binary weight updates, employing integer-valued hidden weights that serve as a synaptic metaplasticity mechanism, thereby enhancing its neurobiological plausibility. Our proposed solution enables the training of binary multi-layer perceptrons by using exclusively XNOR, Popcount, and increment/decrement operations. Experimental results on multi-class classification benchmarks show test accuracy improvements of up to +35.47% over the only existing fully binary single-layer state-of-the-art solution. Compared to full-precision SGD, our solution improves test accuracy by up to +35.30% under the same total memory demand, while also reducing computational cost by two to three orders of magnitude in terms of the total number of Boolean gates. The proposed algorithm is made available to the scientific community as a public repository.

Abstract: Fiducial markers are widely used in various robotics tasks, facilitating enhanced navigation, object recognition, and scene understanding. Despite their advantages for robots and Augmented Reality (AR) applications, they often disrupt the visual aesthetics of environments because they are visible to humans, making them unsuitable for non-intrusive use cases. To address this gap, this paper presents "iMarkers"-innovative, unobtrusive fiducial markers detectable exclusively by robots equipped with specialized sensors. These markers offer high flexibility in production, allowing customization of their visibility range and encoding algorithms to suit various demands. The paper also introduces the hardware designs and software algorithms developed for detecting iMarkers, highlighting their adaptability and robustness in the detection and recognition stages. Various evaluations have demonstrated the effectiveness of iMarkers compared to conventional (printed) and blended fiducial markers and confirmed their applicability in diverse robotics scenarios.

Abstract: Transformer models map input token sequences to output token distributions, layer by layer. While most interpretability work focuses on internal latent representations, we study the evolution of these token-level distributions directly in vocabulary space. However, such distributions are high-dimensional and defined on an unordered support, making common descriptors like moments or cumulants ill-suited. We address this by computing the Shannon entropy of each intermediate predicted distribution, yielding one interpretable scalar per layer. The resulting sequence, the entropy profile, serves as a compact, information-theoretic signature of the model's computation. We introduce Entropy-Lens, a model-agnostic framework that extracts entropy profiles from frozen, off-the-shelf transformers. We show that these profiles (i) reveal family-specific computation patterns invariant under depth rescaling, (ii) are predictive of prompt type and task format, and (iii) correlate with output correctness. We further show that R\'enyi entropies yield similar results within a broad range of $\alpha$ values, justifying the use of Shannon entropy as a stable and principled summary. Our results hold across different transformers, without requiring gradients, fine-tuning, or access to model internals.

<title>The Curse of Conditions: Analyzing and Improving Optimal Transport for Conditional Flow-Based Generation</title>

Abstract: Minibatch optimal transport coupling straightens paths in unconditional flow matching. This leads to computationally less demanding inference as fewer integration steps and less complex numerical solvers can be employed when numerically solving an ordinary differential equation at test time. However, in the conditional setting, minibatch optimal transport falls short. This is because the default optimal transport mapping disregards conditions, resulting in a conditionally skewed prior distribution during training. In contrast, at test time, we have no access to the skewed prior, and instead sample from the full, unbiased prior distribution. This gap between training and testing leads to a subpar performance. To bridge this gap, we propose conditional optimal transport C^2OT that adds a conditional weighting term in the cost matrix when computing the optimal transport assignment. Experiments demonstrate that this simple fix works with both discrete and continuous conditions in 8gaussians-to-moons, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-32x32, and ImageNet-256x256. Our method performs better overall compared to the existing baselines across different function evaluation budgets. Code is available at https://hkchengrex.github.io/C2OT

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have shown promise in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS). However, their direct application to ADS is hindered by challenges such as misunderstanding of traffic knowledge, complex road conditions, and diverse states of vehicle. To address these challenges, we propose the use of Knowledge Editing, which enables targeted modifications to a model's behavior without the need for full retraining. Meanwhile, we introduce ADS-Edit, a multimodal knowledge editing dataset specifically designed for ADS, which includes various real-world scenarios, multiple data types, and comprehensive evaluation metrics. We conduct comprehensive experiments and derive several interesting conclusions. We hope that our work will contribute to the further advancement of knowledge editing applications in the field of autonomous driving.

Abstract: Pre-trained vision transformers have achieved remarkable performance across various visual tasks but suffer from expensive computational and memory costs. While model quantization reduces memory usage by lowering precision, these models still incur significant computational overhead due to the dequantization before matrix operations. In this work, we analyze the computation graph and propose an integerization process based on operation reordering. Specifically, the process delays dequantization until after matrix operations. This enables integerized matrix multiplication and linear module by directly processing the quantized input. To validate our approach, we synthesize the self-attention module of ViT on a systolic array-based hardware. Experimental results show that our low-bit inference reduces per-PE power consumption for linear layer and matrix multiplication, bridging the gap between quantized models and efficient inference.

<title>GRILL: Gradient Signal Restoration in Ill-Conditioned Layers to Enhance Adversarial Attacks on Autoencoders</title>

arXiv:2505.03646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial robustness of deep autoencoders (AEs) remains relatively unexplored, even though their non-invertible nature poses distinct challenges. Existing attack algorithms during the optimization of imperceptible, norm-bounded adversarial perturbations to maximize output damage in AEs, often stop at sub-optimal attacks. We observe that the adversarial loss gradient vanishes when backpropagated through ill-conditioned layers. This issue arises from near-zero singular values in the Jacobians of these layers, which weaken the gradient signal during optimization. We introduce GRILL, a technique that locally restores gradient signals in ill-conditioned layers, enabling more effective norm-bounded attacks. Through extensive experiments on different architectures of popular AEs, under both sample-specific and universal attack setups, and across standard and adaptive attack settings, we show that our method significantly increases the effectiveness of our adversarial attacks, enabling a more rigorous evaluation of AE robustness.

arXiv:2505.19361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deployment of pre-trained perception models in novel environments often leads to performance degradation due to distributional shifts. Although recent artificial intelligence approaches for metacognition use logical rules to characterize and filter model errors, improving precision often comes at the cost of reduced recall. This paper addresses the hypothesis that leveraging multiple pre-trained models can mitigate this recall reduction. We formulate the challenge of identifying and managing conflicting predictions from various models as a consistency-based abduction problem, building on the idea of abductive learning (ABL) but applying it to test-time instead of training. The input predictions and the learned error detection rules derived from each model are encoded in a logic program. We then seek an abductive explanation--a subset of model predictions--that maximizes prediction coverage while ensuring the rate of logical inconsistencies (derived from domain constraints) remains below a specified threshold. We propose two algorithms for this knowledge representation task: an exact method based on Integer Programming (IP) and an efficient Heuristic Search (HS). Through extensive experiments on a simulated aerial imagery dataset featuring controlled, complex distributional shifts, we demonstrate that our abduction-based framework outperforms individual models and standard ensemble baselines, achieving, for instance, average relative improvements of approximately 13.6\% in F1-score and 16.6\% in accuracy across 15 diverse test datasets when compared to the best individual model. Our results validate the use of consistency-based abduction as an effective mechanism to robustly integrate knowledge from multiple imperfect models in challenging, novel scenarios.

Abstract: Interferometric Hyperspectral Imaging (IHI) is a critical technique for large-scale remote sensing tasks due to its advantages in flux and spectral resolution. However, IHI is susceptible to complex errors arising from imaging steps, and its quality is limited by existing signal processing-based reconstruction algorithms. Two key challenges hinder performance enhancement: 1) the lack of training datasets. 2) the difficulty in eliminating IHI-specific degradation components through learning-based methods. To address these challenges, we propose a novel IHI reconstruction pipeline. First, based on imaging physics and radiometric calibration data, we establish a simplified yet accurate IHI degradation model and a parameter estimation method. This model enables the synthesis of realistic IHI training datasets from hyperspectral images (HSIs), bridging the gap between IHI reconstruction and deep learning. Second, we design the Interferometric Hyperspectral Reconstruction Unfolding Transformer (IHRUT), which achieves effective spectral correction and detail restoration through a stripe-pattern enhancement mechanism and a spatial-spectral transformer architecture. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and generalization capability of our method.The code and are available at https://github.com/bit1120203554/IHRUT.

Abstract: Robustness and resource-efficiency are two highly desirable properties for modern machine learning models. However, achieving them jointly remains a challenge. In this paper, we identify high learning rates as a facilitator for simultaneously achieving robustness to spurious correlations and network compressibility. We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce desirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization, class separation, and activation sparsity. Our findings indicate that large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and regularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem. In addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across diverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present strong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates in standard classification tasks is related to addressing hidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset. Our investigation of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon reveals the importance of confident mispredictions of bias-conflicting samples under large learning rates.

Abstract: Hateful memes aimed at LGBTQ\,+ communities often evade detection by tweaking either the caption, the image, or both. We build the first robustness benchmark for this setting, pairing four realistic caption attacks with three canonical image corruptions and testing all combinations on the PrideMM dataset. Two state-of-the-art detectors, MemeCLIP and MemeBLIP2, serve as case studies, and we introduce a lightweight \textbf{Text Denoising Adapter (TDA)} to enhance the latter's resilience. Across the grid, MemeCLIP degrades more gently, while MemeBLIP2 is particularly sensitive to the caption edits that disrupt its language processing. However, the addition of the TDA not only remedies this weakness but makes MemeBLIP2 the most robust model overall. Ablations reveal that all systems lean heavily on text, but architectural choices and pre-training data significantly impact robustness. Our benchmark exposes where current multimodal safety models crack and demonstrates that targeted, lightweight modules like the TDA offer a powerful path towards stronger defences.

Abstract: Recent advances in leveraging large-scale Internet photo collections for 3D reconstruction have enabled immersive virtual exploration of landmarks and historic sites worldwide. However, little attention has been given to the immersive understanding of architectural styles and structural knowledge, which remains largely confined to browsing static text-image pairs. Therefore, can we draw inspiration from 3D in-the-wild reconstruction techniques and use unconstrained photo collections to create an immersive approach for understanding the 3D structure of architectural components? To this end, we extend language embedded 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and propose a novel framework for open-vocabulary scene understanding from unconstrained photo collections. Specifically, we first render multiple appearance images from the same viewpoint as the unconstrained image with the reconstructed radiance field, then extract multi-appearance CLIP features and two types of language feature uncertainty maps-transient and appearance uncertainty-derived from the multi-appearance features to guide the subsequent optimization process. Next, we propose a transient uncertainty-aware autoencoder, a multi-appearance language field 3DGS representation, and a post-ensemble strategy to effectively compress, learn, and fuse language features from multiple appearances. Finally, to quantitatively evaluate our method, we introduce PT-OVS, a new benchmark dataset for assessing open-vocabulary segmentation performance on unconstrained photo collections. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods, delivering accurate open-vocabulary segmentation and enabling applications such as interactive roaming with open-vocabulary queries, architectural style pattern recognition, and 3D scene editing.

Abstract: In modern urban environments, camera networks generate massive amounts of operational footage -- reaching petabytes each day -- making scalable video analytics essential for efficient processing. Many existing approaches adopt an SQL-based paradigm for querying such large-scale video databases; however, this constrains queries to rigid patterns with predefined semantic categories, significantly limiting analytical flexibility. In this work, we explore a language-driven video analytics paradigm aimed at enabling flexible and efficient querying of high-volume video data driven by natural language. Particularly, we build \textsc{Lava}, a system that accepts natural language queries and retrieves traffic targets across multiple levels of granularity and arbitrary categories. \textsc{Lava} comprises three main components: 1) a multi-armed bandit-based efficient sampling method for video segment-level localization;
  2) a video-specific open-world detection module for object-level retrieval; and 3) a long-term object trajectory extraction scheme for temporal object association, yielding complete trajectories for object-of-interests. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further develop a novel benchmark by providing diverse, semantically rich natural language predicates and fine-grained annotations for multiple videos. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate that \textsc{Lava} improves $F_1$-scores for selection queries by $\mathbf{14\%}$, reduces MPAE for aggregation queries by $\mathbf{0.39}$, and achieves top-$k$ precision of $\mathbf{86\%}$, while processing videos $ \mathbf{9.6\times} $ faster than the most accurate baseline.

<div> Keywords: augmented reality, visual information manipulation attacks, taxonomy, dataset, multimodal semantic reasoning 

Summary: 
Visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in augmented reality (AR) can distort the meaning of real-world scenes, causing semantic misunderstandings and user errors. This work introduces a taxonomy categorizing VIM attacks into character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, with purposes including information replacement and obfuscation. A dataset, AR-VIM, consisting of 452 AR video pairs, is created to simulate real-world scenarios for attack detection. A multimodal semantic reasoning framework, VIM-Sense, using vision-language models and optical character recognition, achieves an 88.94% attack detection accuracy on AR-VIM. The system detects attacks with an average latency of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds on a mobile Android AR application in a real-world evaluation. VIM-Sense outperforms vision-only and text-only baselines, offering effective protection against VIM attacks in AR environments.

Abstract: The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR, where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes: information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information. Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM, which consists of 452 raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world AR scenario. To detect the attacks in the dataset, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only and text-only baselines. The system achieves an average attack detection latency of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.

Summary:<br /><br />Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has become a challenging yet crucial task in computer vision. This paper introduces a new perspective that categorizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence. These levels include reconstructing low-level 3D attributes, scene components, dynamic scenes, modeling interactions, and incorporating physical laws. The survey addresses the gaps in previous research and highlights key challenges at each level. By organizing methods based on their hierarchical structure, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of 4D scene reconstruction. Moving forward, the study suggests promising directions for advancing towards richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence.

Abstract: Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been a central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world applications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the focus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI, which emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid advances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has evolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally, existing surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical structure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new perspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D spatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes (e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene components (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction of 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene components; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints. We conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and highlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D spatial intelligence.

Deepfakes generated by advanced machine learning models pose a significant threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital media. Despite the development of detectors, their effectiveness in real-world scenarios remains uncertain. This study evaluates modern deepfake detectors using a novel testing procedure on a dataset containing over 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. The analysis reveals that detecting deepfakes is still a challenging task, with less than half of the detectors achieving an AUC score above 60%. Basic image manipulations like JPEG compression can impair model performance significantly. The findings underscore the importance of ongoing research and development in deepfake detection technology to combat the growing threat of deceptive media.

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem, their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly reduce model performance.

Abstract: The invasive spotted lanternfly (SLF) poses a significant threat to agriculture and ecosystems, causing widespread damage. Current control methods, such as egg scraping, pesticides, and quarantines, prove labor-intensive, environmentally hazardous, and inadequate for long-term SLF suppression. This research introduces LanternNet, a novel autonomous robotic Hub-and-Spoke system designed for scalable detection and suppression of SLF populations. A central, tree-mimicking hub utilizes a YOLOv8 computer vision model for precise SLF identification. Three specialized robotic spokes perform targeted tasks: pest neutralization, environmental monitoring, and navigation/mapping. Field deployment across multiple infested sites over 5 weeks demonstrated LanternNet's efficacy. Quantitative analysis revealed significant reductions (p < 0.01, paired t-tests) in SLF populations and corresponding improvements in tree health indicators across the majority of test sites. Compared to conventional methods, LanternNet offers substantial cost advantages and improved scalability. Furthermore, the system's adaptability for enhanced autonomy and targeting of other invasive species presents significant potential for broader ecological impact. LanternNet demonstrates the transformative potential of integrating robotics and AI for advanced invasive species management and improved environmental outcomes.

Summary:
HoneyImage is proposed for dataset ownership verification in image recognition models. It selectively modifies hard samples to embed imperceptible traces, enabling reliable verification while preserving data integrity. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and model architectures validate HoneyImage's effectiveness in achieving strong verification accuracy with minimal impact on performance. The method enhances data owners' ability to protect proprietary image datasets, fostering safe sharing and unlocking data-driven AI's transformative potential. <div>
arXiv:2508.00892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image-based AI models are increasingly deployed across a wide range of domains, including healthcare, security, and consumer applications. However, many image datasets carry sensitive or proprietary content, raising critical concerns about unauthorized data usage. Data owners therefore need reliable mechanisms to verify whether their proprietary data has been misused to train third-party models. Existing solutions, such as backdoor watermarking and membership inference, face inherent trade-offs between verification effectiveness and preservation of data integrity. In this work, we propose HoneyImage, a novel method for dataset ownership verification in image recognition models. HoneyImage selectively modifies a small number of hard samples to embed imperceptible yet verifiable traces, enabling reliable ownership verification while maintaining dataset integrity. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple model architectures show that HoneyImage consistently achieves strong verification accuracy with minimal impact on downstream performance while maintaining imperceptible. The proposed HoneyImage method could provide data owners with a practical mechanism to protect ownership over valuable image datasets, encouraging safe sharing and unlocking the full transformative potential of data-driven AI.

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks, particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation strategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage mask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while also reducing inference time compared to conventional approach. The method integrates generation and conditioning into a unified framework, offering a scalable solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.

Abstract: In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly impacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision, enabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video frame prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous systems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and streaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as highly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame prediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several hybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction capabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related architectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three datasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and grayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform well, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid models utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale videos with real data are the easiest to predict.

Summary: 
TESPEC introduces a self-supervised pre-training framework focused on learning spatio-temporal information for event-based perception tasks. Unlike existing methods, TESPEC leverages long event sequences during pre-training, allowing recurrent models to excel. By accumulating events into pseudo grayscale videos that capture high-level semantic information, TESPEC enables models to reason about the long-term history of events, improving robustness to sensor noise and motion blur. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in downstream tasks such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. TESPEC's innovative approach offers state-of-the-art results by enhancing the temporal understanding of event data and showcasing the importance of incorporating long-term temporal information for improved event-based perception tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks, as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts. Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) face challenges in effectively coordinating diverse attention mechanisms for cross-modal embedding learning, leading to mismatched attention and suboptimal performance. We propose Consistent Cross-layer Regional Alignment (CCRA), which introduces Layer-Patch-wise Cross Attention (LPWCA) to capture fine-grained regional-semantic correlations by jointly weighting patch and layer-wise embedding, and Progressive Attention Integration (PAI) that systematically coordinates LPWCA, layer-wise, and patch-wise attention mechanisms in sequence. This progressive design ensures consistency from semantic to regional levels while preventing attention drift and maximizing individual attention benefits. Experimental results on ten diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that our CCRA-enhanced LLaVA-v1.5-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all baseline methods with only 3.55M additional parameters, while providing enhanced interpretability through more regionally focused and semantically aligned attention patterns.

Abstract: Infrared thermography is emerging as a powerful tool in sports medicine, allowing assessment of thermal radiation during exercise and analysis of anatomical regions of interest, such as the well-exposed calves. Building on our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

Abstract: We present ROVI, a high-quality synthetic dataset for instance-grounded text-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M curated web images. Our key innovation is a strategy called re-captioning, focusing on the pre-detection stage, where a VLM (Vision-Language Model) generates comprehensive visual descriptions that are then processed by an LLM (Large Language Model) to extract a flat list of potential categories for OVDs (Open-Vocabulary Detectors) to detect. This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to instance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically overlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in image quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more categories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a text-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity, and aesthetic quality.

Summary: 
The paper introduces AutoSIGHT, a system that automatically assesses human expertise in visual tasks using eye tracking data. It classifies performers as expert or non-expert based on features extracted during task-solving. Results show AutoSIGHT achieves an average AUROC of 0.751 in a subject-disjoint train-test regime with a 5-second evaluation window, indicating effective detection. With a 30-second window, the AUROC increases to 0.8306, leveraging more information at the cost of delayed decisions. This work suggests new research directions on incorporating human and machine expertise in human-AI partnerships that adapt to changing expertise distribution. The eye tracking data from 6 experts and 53 non-experts solving iris PAD tasks is also provided.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT, Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds, AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of 0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye tracking data used in this study collected from 6 experts and 53 non-experts solving iris PAD visual task.

<div> Keywords: 3D reconstruction, incremental Structure from Motion, geometric estimation, bundle adjustment, reprojection error

Summary:
Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is essential for various applications. Global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques are precise but can be sensitive to noise and missing data. Incremental SfM, on the other hand, allows for flexible reconstruction by gradually incorporating new views. This method can recover scene structure and camera motion in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. The paper provides a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing on geometric estimation consistency and the iterative refinement through bundle adjustment. By applying this approach to a real dataset, the study evaluates reconstruction quality based on reprojection error and camera trajectory coherence. The results demonstrate the practical utility of incremental SfM as a reliable method for achieving sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured environments.

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is a key requirement in applications such as robotics, mapping, and scene understanding. While global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques rely on full image connectivity and can be sensitive to noise or missing data, incremental SfM offers a more flexible alternative. By progressively incorporating new views into the reconstruction, it enables the system to recover scene structure and camera motion even in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. In this paper, we present a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing on the consistency of geometric estimation and the effect of iterative refinement through bundle adjustment. We demonstrate the approach using a real dataset and assess reconstruction quality through reprojection error and camera trajectory coherence. The results support the practical utility of incremental SfM as a reliable method for sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured environments.

<div> Keywords: CT scan, multi-label classification, anomaly detection, graph-based approach, spectral domain convolution 

Summary: 
This study addresses the need for automated methods to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload due to a rising number of CT scans. The proposed graph-based approach models CT scans as structured graphs and leverages spectral domain convolution on axial slice triplets nodes to enhance multi-label anomaly classification. The method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, competitive performance, and robustness to z-axis translation. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional networks struggle with modeling long-range dependencies, while Vision Transformers are computationally expensive and require extensive pre-training. The new approach demonstrates improved performance in multi-label classification of 3D CT scans by effectively capturing complex spatial relationships within volumetric data. Additionally, an ablation study evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

Abstract: With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload. Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs, leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

<div> Keywords: Dataset Ownership Verification, Copyright Detection, Evasion Attacks, Vision-Language Models, Large Language Models

Summary:
This paper introduces a novel approach to evade Dataset Ownership Verification (DOV) methods, focusing on protecting copyright in deep model training. The proposed framework involves transferring task-relevant domain knowledge from a teacher model to a student model using an out-of-distribution dataset as an intermediary. By selectively transferring knowledge, the approach achieves a balance between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that this method outperforms state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and effectiveness while eliminating all copyright identifiers. The study also exposes vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, emphasizing the importance of ongoing development to enhance practicality.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large scale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for rapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive information, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification (DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for long-term development to enhance practicality.

The article introduces DreamSat-2.0, a pipeline that evaluates three cutting-edge 3D reconstruction models (Hunyuan-3D, Trellis-3D, and Ouroboros-3D) on spacecraft and asteroid datasets. The analysis shows that model performance varies based on the domain, with higher-quality images produced for complex spacecraft and better geometric reconstructions for simpler asteroids. New benchmarks are set, with Hunyuan-3D excelling in perceptual scores for spacecraft and geometric accuracy for asteroids. This marks a significant improvement over previous research and highlights the importance of domain-specific evaluation in enhancing asteroid exploration and spacecraft navigation. <div>

Abstract: To enhance asteroid exploration and autonomous spacecraft navigation, we introduce DreamSat-2.0, a pipeline that benchmarks three state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models-Hunyuan-3D, Trellis-3D, and Ouroboros-3D-on custom spacecraft and asteroid datasets. Our systematic analysis, using 2D perceptual (image quality) and 3D geometric (shape accuracy) metrics, reveals that model performance is domain-dependent. While models produce higher-quality images of complex spacecraft, they achieve better geometric reconstructions for the simpler forms of asteroids. New benchmarks are established, with Hunyuan-3D achieving top perceptual scores on spacecraft but its best geometric accuracy on asteroids, marking a significant advance over our prior work.

- The proposed approach, COSTARR, combines the familiar features requirement and the absence of unfamiliar features to improve open-set recognition.

arXiv:2508.01087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handling novelty remains a key challenge in visual recognition systems. Existing open-set recognition (OSR) methods rely on the familiarity hypothesis, detecting novelty by the absence of familiar features. We propose a novel attenuation hypothesis: small weights learned during training attenuate features and serve a dual role-differentiating known classes while discarding information useful for distinguishing known from unknown classes. To leverage this overlooked information, we present COSTARR, a novel approach that combines both the requirement of familiar features and the lack of unfamiliar ones. We provide a probabilistic interpretation of the COSTARR score, linking it to the likelihood of correct classification and belonging in a known class. To determine the individual contributions of the pre- and post-attenuated features to COSTARR's performance, we conduct ablation studies that show both pre-attenuated deep features and the underutilized post-attenuated Hadamard product features are essential for improving OSR. Also, we evaluate COSTARR in a large-scale setting using ImageNet2012-1K as known data and NINCO, iNaturalist, OpenImage-O, and other datasets as unknowns, across multiple modern pre-trained architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, and ResNet). The experiments demonstrate that COSTARR generalizes effectively across various architectures and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by incorporating previously discarded attenuation information, advancing open-set recognition capabilities.

Summary: 
AURA is a hybrid spatiotemporal-chromatic framework aimed at detecting and classifying industrial smoke emissions in real-time. Current monitoring systems often struggle to differentiate smoke types and handle environmental variability, which AURA addresses by leveraging dynamic movement patterns and color characteristics of industrial smoke.

Summary:
Trans-Adapter is introduced as a solution for processing RGBA images directly using diffusion-based inpainting models, allowing for better preservation of transparency consistency in edited regions. It also supports controllable editing through ControlNet integration and can be easily integrated into various existing models. LayerBench, a new evaluation benchmark, is introduced along with a novel metric for assessing transparency edge quality. The method addresses challenges faced by conventional transparent image inpainting methods by offering a more seamless and efficient workflow. Experimental results on LayerBench showcase the effectiveness of Trans-Adapter in handling transparent images and ensuring high-quality transparency edge preservation. <div>
arXiv:2508.01098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RGBA images, with the additional alpha channel, are crucial for any application that needs blending, masking, or transparency effects, making them more versatile than standard RGB images. Nevertheless, existing image inpainting methods are designed exclusively for RGB images. Conventional approaches to transparent image inpainting typically involve placing a background underneath RGBA images and employing a two-stage process: image inpainting followed by image matting. This pipeline, however, struggles to preserve transparency consistency in edited regions, and matting can introduce jagged edges along transparency boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based inpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also supports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated into various community models. To evaluate our method, we introduce LayerBench, along with a novel non-reference alpha edge quality evaluation metric for assessing transparency edge quality. We conduct extensive experiments on LayerBench to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Summary: 
MASIV is a novel vision-based framework for system identification from videos that does not rely on predefined material priors. It utilizes learnable neural constitutive models to infer object dynamics without assuming specific material properties, allowing for more flexibility in handling unknown materials. MASIV addresses the challenge of incomplete particle state information by incorporating dense geometric guidance through reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, which provides richer motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues. The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability, indicating its effectiveness in recovering object geometry and physical laws from videos. <div>

Abstract: System identification from videos aims to recover object geometry and governing physical laws. Existing methods integrate differentiable rendering with simulation but rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability to handle unknown ones. We introduce MASIV, the first vision-based framework for material-agnostic system identification. Unlike existing approaches that depend on hand-crafted constitutive laws, MASIV employs learnable neural constitutive models, inferring object dynamics without assuming a scene-specific material prior. However, the absence of full particle state information imposes unique challenges, leading to unstable optimization and physically implausible behaviors. To address this, we introduce dense geometric guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, providing temporally rich motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues. Comprehensive experiments show that MASIV achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability.

Summary: <br />
The study investigates three strategies - supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning - to enhance performance on image editing tasks using an autoregressive multimodal model that processes textual and visual tokens together. Through experimentation, RL combined with a large multi-modal LLM verifier emerged as the most effective strategy. This led to the development of EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a robust RL-based image editing model that achieves competitive results across various editing tasks with minimal training data. The released EARL model marks a significant advancement in autoregressive multimodal models for image editing tasks. The code, training data, and trained models for EARL are available at https://github.com/mair-lab/EARL. <div>

Abstract: We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at https://github.com/mair-lab/EARL.

The paper introduces two novel tasks, Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, which utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without explicit 3D scenes. UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional motion diffusion model, is proposed for egocentric devices and supports egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation. The model extracts image-based scene context to infer plausible 3D motion and achieves state-of-the-art performance in egocentric motion reconstruction. The framework is the first to generate motion from a single egocentric image. A large-scale dataset, EE4D-Motion, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth 3D motion annotations is introduced to facilitate training. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications. <div>

Abstract: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction, advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective. However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth 3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.

arXiv:2508.01137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI volumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets collected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and 578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing (unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization, skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7% (image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA) methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset, indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its potential for real-world clinical applications.

Summary: 
The article introduces DC3, a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation that aims to address the trade-off between performance and fidelity when compressing datasets. Existing methods either struggle with inefficiency in selection or introduce semantic distortion. DC3 focuses on enhancing the color diversity of condensed images to improve representation learning. Through a calibrated selection strategy and the use of a latent diffusion model, DC3 outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks. Additionally, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets. Experimental results show superior performance and generalization, with FID results indicating the feasibility of training networks with high-quality datasets generated by DC3 without degradation issues. Code and data generated by DC3 will be released soon. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

OpenGS-Fusion introduces an innovative framework for open-vocabulary dense mapping, enhancing semantic modeling and refining object-level understanding. By combining 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed Distance Field, the framework allows for lossless fusion of semantic features in real-time.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene understanding have made significant strides in enabling interaction with scenes using open-vocabulary queries, particularly for VR/AR and robotic applications. Nevertheless, existing methods are hindered by rigid offline pipelines and the inability to provide precise 3D object-level understanding given open-ended queries. In this paper, we present OpenGS-Fusion, an innovative open-vocabulary dense mapping framework that improves semantic modeling and refines object-level understanding. OpenGS-Fusion combines 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed Distance Field to facilitate lossless fusion of semantic features on-the-fly. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal language-guided approach named MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding, which refines the segmentation of 3D objects by adaptively adjusting similarity thresholds, achieving an improvement 17\% in 3D mIoU compared to the fixed threshold strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in 3D object understanding and scene reconstruction quality, as well as showcasing its effectiveness in language-guided scene interaction.

<div> Keywords: Text-to-image diffusion models, safety mechanisms, personalized user profiles, Sage dataset, harmful content suppression

Summary:
Text-to-image diffusion models have transformed visual content generation, but current safety measures do not consider individual user preferences. The proposed Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA) framework addresses this gap by allowing users to control safety behaviors in generative models based on their preferences. By integrating personalized user profiles into the diffusion process and utilizing the Sage dataset, PSA adjusts the model's behavior to align with individual safety preferences while maintaining image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that PSA performs better in suppressing harmful content and aligning generated content with user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. The code, data, and models for PSA are publicly available at https://torpedo2648.github.io/PSAlign/.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation, but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process, adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://torpedo2648.github.io/PSAlign/.

<div> Keywords: LawDIS, dichotomous image segmentation, language-controlled segmentation, window-controlled refinement, latent diffusion model 

Summary: 
LawDIS is a new framework for image segmentation that combines language and window-based controls to produce high-quality object masks. It uses a latent diffusion model to integrate user controls seamlessly, offering macro and micro control modes. In macro mode, a language-controlled segmentation strategy generates an initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a window-controlled refinement strategy allows flexible adjustments within the initial mask. The framework can operate independently or together, making it suitable for personalized applications. Experimental results on the DIS5K benchmark show that LawDIS outperforms 11 state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant gains in accuracy. The framework significantly outperforms the second-best model, MVANet, across all metrics on DIS-TE. The code for LawDIS will be available on GitHub at https://github.com/XinyuYanTJU/LawDIS.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present LawDIS, a language-window-based controllable dichotomous image segmentation (DIS) framework that produces high-quality object masks. Our framework recasts DIS as an image-conditioned mask generation task within a latent diffusion model, enabling seamless integration of user controls. LawDIS is enhanced with macro-to-micro control modes. Specifically, in macro mode, we introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask. Coordinated by a mode switcher, these modes can operate independently or jointly, making the framework well-suited for high-accuracy, personalised applications. Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our LawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics. Notably, compared to the second-best model MVANet, we achieve $F_\beta^\omega$ gains of 4.6\% with both the LS and WR strategies and 3.6\% gains with only the LS strategy on DIS-TE. Codes will be made available at https://github.com/XinyuYanTJU/LawDIS.

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains a challenging task due to complex visual appearances and limited semantic priors. We propose TEACH, a novel training paradigm that injects ground-truth text into the model as auxiliary input and progressively reduces its influence during training. By encoding target labels into the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a curriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning to fully visual recognition.

It is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder frameworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that models trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially under challenging conditions, validating its robustness and general applicability.

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for accelerating dense long-term 3D point tracking in videos. Through analysis of existing state-of-the-art methods, we identify two major computational bottlenecks. First, transformer-based iterative tracking becomes expensive when handling a large number of trajectories. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy that begins tracking with a small subset of points and progressively expands the set of tracked trajectories. The newly added trajectories are initialized using a learnable interpolation module, which is trained end-to-end alongside the tracking network. Second, we propose an optimization that significantly reduces the cost of correlation feature computation, another key bottleneck in prior methods. Together, these improvements lead to a 5-100x speedup over existing approaches while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

Summary: <br />
SPFSplat is a framework for efficient 3D Gaussian splatting from sparse multi-view images that does not require ground-truth poses during training or inference. It simultaneously predicts 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a canonical space in a single feed-forward step. The framework includes a rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses and a reprojection loss to improve geometric constraints. Despite lacking pose supervision, SPFSplat performs exceptionally well in novel view synthesis, especially under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap.

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplat, an efficient framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training or inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a canonical space from unposed inputs within a single feed-forward step. Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited for practical applications. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose supervision, SPFSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis even under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap. It also surpasses recent methods trained with geometry priors in relative pose estimation. Code and trained models are available on our project page: https://ranrhuang.github.io/spfsplat/.

<div> Keywords: Embodied AI, object manipulation, 3D affordance grounding, affordance classification, multi-scale feature propagation

Summary:
Embodied AI faces the challenge of learning object manipulation from observation like humans. Prior methods often separate the tasks of localizing 3D object affordance areas and understanding their functionalities, leading to inconsistent predictions. These methods also tend to only ground incomplete affordance areas depicted in images and operate at a fixed scale, making it difficult to handle varying affordance scales. To address these issues, a novel approach is proposed that learns an affordance-aware 3D representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy that considers the dependency between grounding and classification tasks. By developing a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and multi-scale feature propagation, the method can infer full potential affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. A two-stage prediction mechanism is also adopted to improve affordance understanding. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in both affordance grounding and classification. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification). Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance grounding and classification.

Summary:<br />
Visual grounding is crucial for spatial perception in autonomous driving, but current methods relying on bounding boxes often lack fine-grained detail. To address this, a new benchmark for 3D occupancy grounding in outdoor scenes has been introduced, using natural language and voxel-level occupancy annotations for more precise object representation. The GroundingOcc model, designed for this task, combines visual, textual, and point cloud features for accurate object location and occupancy prediction. The model includes a multimodal encoder, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a grounding head for location refinement. Additional modules for 2D grounding and depth estimation enhance geometric understanding, resulting in improved performance compared to existing baselines. The dataset and model code are available for further research and development. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task. Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual, and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is available at https://github.com/RONINGOD/GroundingOcc.

Summary:
RoadMamba, a novel approach for road surface classification, combines local and global perception using the Mamba architecture. By utilizing the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM), RoadMamba effectively extracts both global semantics and local texture of road surfaces. The Dual Attention Fusion (DAF) decodes and fuses these dual features, enhancing classification accuracy. The addition of a dual auxiliary loss further ensures that the network does not solely rely on global semantic information but also considers the local texture. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that RoadMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods. This innovative approach holds promise for enhancing the planning and control systems of autonomous vehicles, ultimately improving safety and driving comfort on the road.

Abstract: Acquiring the road surface conditions in advance based on visual technologies provides effective information for the planning and control system of autonomous vehicles, thus improving the safety and driving comfort of the vehicles. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state-space models has shown remarkable performance in visual processing tasks, benefiting from the efficient global receptive field. However, existing Mamba architectures struggle to achieve state-of-the-art visual road surface classification due to their lack of effective extraction of the local texture of the road surface. In this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of visual Mamba architectures for road surface classification task and propose a method that effectively combines local and global perception, called RoadMamba. Specifically, we utilize the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) to effectively extract the global semantics and local texture of the road surface and decode and fuse the dual features through the Dual Attention Fusion (DAF). In addition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual branches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic information from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture. The proposed RoadMamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance in experiments on a large-scale road surface classification dataset containing 1 million samples.

<div> Keywords: Diffusion models, Style transfer, Prior-Guided Data Distillation, Contrastive Semantic Decoupling, Semantic preservation

Summary: 
StyDeco introduces a new framework for style transfer in images by addressing the limitations of existing text-driven diffusion models. The framework utilizes Prior-Guided Data Distillation to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision, generating pseudo-paired data for training. Contrastive Semantic Decoupling is then applied to adapt a text encoder using domain-specific weights, encouraging distinct semantic clusters for source and target representations. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that StyDeco outperforms existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity and structural preservation. The framework also supports a unique de-stylization process, showcasing its versatility. The code for StyDeco is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for style transfer, but their text-driven mechanism is hindered by a core limitation: it treats textual descriptions as uniform, monolithic guidance. This limitation overlooks the semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the spatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of semantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper, we propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by learning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer task. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a strategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It leverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize pseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling (CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using domain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic space, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters. Extensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity and structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer with semantic preservation. In addition, our framework supports a unique de-stylization process, further demonstrating its extensibility. Our code is vailable at https://github.com/QuanjianSong/StyDeco.

<div> Keywords: floorplan localization, visual context, unsupervised learning, scene layout priors, room discriminator<br />
Summary:<br />
- Visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc) is crucial for understanding building layouts but can be challenging due to repetitive structures in floorplans leading to ambiguous localization.
- Existing methods rely on matching 2D structural cues or 3D geometry-constrained pre-trainings, ignoring richer contextual information provided by visual images.
- The proposed approach utilizes broader visual scene context and an unsupervised learning technique with clustering constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on unlabeled room images.
- The room discriminator extracts hidden room types and guides FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to improve localization accuracy.
- Comparative studies on benchmark datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness and accuracy.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since a building's floorplan remains consistent over time and is inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc) has received increasing attention from researchers. However, as a compact and minimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many repetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in ambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D structural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual pre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual images. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty. In particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room images. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of the observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the scene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc algorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite visual FLoc. We conducted sufficient comparative studies on two standard visual Floc benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvements in robustness and accuracy.

Summary:
MoGaFace is a new framework for 3D head avatar modeling that improves upon existing methods by refining facial geometry and texture attributes continuously during the Gaussian rendering process. It addresses misalignment between estimated meshes and target images with the Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which ensures temporal and multi-view consistency. The framework also includes Latent Texture Attention, which encodes multi-view features into head-aware representations for geometry-aware texture refinement. Experimental results show that MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction and improves novel-view synthesis quality, even in inaccurate mesh initialization and real-world settings. <div>
arXiv:2508.01218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing 3D head avatar reconstruction methods adopt a two-stage process, relying on tracked FLAME meshes derived from facial landmarks, followed by Gaussian-based rendering. However, misalignment between the estimated mesh and target images often leads to suboptimal rendering quality and loss of fine visual details. In this paper, we present MoGaFace, a novel 3D head avatar modeling framework that continuously refines facial geometry and texture attributes throughout the Gaussian rendering process. To address the misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, we introduce the Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which incorporates a momentum-updated expression bank and an expression-aware correction mechanism to ensure temporal and multi-view consistency. Additionally, we propose Latent Texture Attention, which encodes compact multi-view features into head-aware representations, enabling geometry-aware texture refinement via integration into Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity head avatar reconstruction and significantly improves novel-view synthesis quality, even under inaccurate mesh initialization and unconstrained real-world settings.

Summary:
The article introduces the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture designed to address the inherent disordered weight structures in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) that can degrade learning dynamics. By reparameterizing weights in a layer-shared, learned eigenbasis, ENN enforces decorrelated and well-aligned weight dynamics, leading to more structured and discriminative feature representations. Integrated with standard backpropagation, ENN surpasses state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image classification benchmarks like ImageNet and sets a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval. The article also introduces ENN-ℓ, a backpropagation-free local learning variant that achieves over 2x training speedup via parallelism and outperforms end-to-end backpropagation in accuracy. Overall, ENN presents a new architectural paradigm that directly addresses representational deficiencies in DNNs, leading to enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training regime.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP, ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval. Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient, backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$ training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training regime.

<div> Keywords: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks, ParaRevSNN, memory-efficient training, parallel architecture, resource-constrained scenarios

Summary: 
ParaRevSNN is a new architecture designed to address the high latency issue in Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) by introducing parallelism. By decoupling sequential dependencies between reversible blocks, ParaRevSNN allows for inter-block parallelism while maintaining reversibility. This design significantly accelerates both training and inference processes while still preserving the memory-saving benefits of RevSNNs. Experimental results show that ParaRevSNN achieves equal or better accuracy compared to standard RevSNNs on datasets like CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128 Gesture. Moreover, ParaRevSNN reduces training time by up to 35.2% and inference time to 18.15%, making it ideal for deployment in scenarios with limited resources. The parallel architecture of ParaRevSNN provides a promising approach for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of reversible spiking neural networks.

Abstract: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) enable memory-efficient training by reconstructing forward activations during backpropagation, but suffer from high latency due to strictly sequential computation. To overcome this limitation, we propose ParaRevSNN, a parallel reversible SNN architecture that decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks while preserving reversibility. This design enables inter-block parallelism, significantly accelerating training and inference while retaining the memory-saving benefits of reversibility. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128 Gesture demonstrate that ParaRevSNN matches or exceeds the accuracy of standard RevSNNs, while reducing training time by up to 35.2\% and inference time to 18.15\%, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained scenarios.

<br />
Summary: 
- Test-time adaptation (TTA) in a zero-shot setting aims to improve model performance on unknown test distributions by utilizing unlabeled data. 
- Existing methods for cache-enhanced TTA may not ensure compact intra-class distributions due to reliance on low-entropy samples for prototype construction. 
- A positive correlation between cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness was identified, leading to the proposal of MCP, which utilizes three caches for prototype initialization, information integration, and prediction calibration. 
- The MCP++ framework further enhances performance by incorporating cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning. 
- Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance. <br /> <div>

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve state-of-the-art generalization performance.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new multi-view open-set learning framework that addresses the limitations of existing models in handling open-set scenarios. By incorporating ambiguity uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing, the proposed framework aims to improve recognition of unknown categories while maintaining strong closed-set performance. A novel synthesis strategy called O-Mix is designed to generate virtual samples with calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty, which are then processed by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network to capture atypical patterns. Additionally, an HSIC-based contrastive debiasing module is integrated to encourage the model to learn generalizable features by enforcing independence between view-specific ambiguous and view-consistent representations. Experimental results on various multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in enhancing unknown-class recognition and mitigating static view-induced biases. <div>

Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples, we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

Summary: 
The paper discusses the challenges posed by the high computational cost of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) due to the extensive visual sequence of input tokens. Existing methods for reducing this cost often result in performance degradation due to loss of visual information. To address this issue, the paper proposes an Adaptive Content Compensation Method (ACCM) that leverages image captions to mitigate information loss. The ACCM consists of a lightweight caption model and a selector that generates question-related descriptions and selects appropriate captions, respectively. These modules are trained using self-supervised learning without the need for human or automated labeling. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ACCM outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 20.6% with 6.5% fewer FLOPs. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method (ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates. Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6% with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).

Summary: 
The paper introduces a new framework, OCSplats, for anti-noise 3D reconstruction, addressing challenges such as label noise in real-world scenarios. OCSplats leverages technologies like hybrid noise assessment and cognitive correction to improve noise classification accuracy in areas with cognitive differences. It also incorporates a label noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points to handle varying noise proportions in different scenarios without parameter adjustments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of OCSplats, showing superior reconstruction performance and precise label noise classification across scenes of different complexity levels.

arXiv:2508.01239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most promising 3D reconstruction technologies. However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.

NS-Net is a novel detection framework that addresses limitations in existing detectors by leveraging CLIP features for AI-generated image detection. It uses NULL-Space projection to separate semantic information from visual features, and contrastive learning to capture distributional differences between real and generated images. A Patch Selection strategy is employed to preserve fine-grained artifacts and mitigate semantic bias from global image structures. Experimental results on 40 generative models demonstrate NS-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a 7.4% improvement in detection accuracy and strong generalization across GAN- and diffusion-based image generation techniques.

arXiv:2508.01248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models, has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net, a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy, thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and diffusion-based image generation techniques.

<div> Keywords: Face parsing, Weakly supervised learning, Representation disentanglement, Co-occurring components, Natural language descriptions

Summary: 
Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components using only weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions. The new task setting of Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP) faces challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual similarity of facial components resulting in ambiguous activations and degraded parsing performance. To address this, DisFaceRep, a representation disentanglement framework, is proposed. DisFaceRep employs both explicit and implicit mechanisms to separate co-occurring facial components. It introduces a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to reduce dataset-level bias explicitly and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DisFaceRep in outperforming existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. Find the code at: <a href="https://github.com/CVI-SZU/DisFaceRep">https://github.com/CVI-SZU/DisFaceRep</a>.

Abstract: Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components such as eyes, lips, and eyebrows. While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions. WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically, we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive experiments on CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen demonstrate the difficulty of WSFP and the effectiveness of DisFaceRep, which significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods.

Summary:
The paper introduces a new framework for efficient image clustering by enhancing large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP. The framework addresses the mismatch between task-agnostic representations and specific clustering tasks. It consists of two stages - Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Self-Enhancement. The first stage focuses on aligning lightweight clustering heads with the model's semantics through mining consistency between image-text pairs. A novel method for generating high-quality cluster centers and a dynamic balancing regularizer are also introduced. In the second stage, a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy using self-generated supervisory signals from the aligned model is employed to optimize the vision encoder and clustering heads. Experimental results on six datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing deep clustering methods, with the ViT-B/32 model achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods based on larger models like ViT-L/14. <div>
arXiv:2508.01254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP offer powerful generic features for image clustering, existing methods typically freeze the encoder. This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic representations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a ceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced framework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image clustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement. In the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining consistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster assignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to align with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process is bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers and a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In the second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The well-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label generator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back the efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads, unlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream datasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by significant margins. Notably, our ViT-B/32 model already matches or even surpasses the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods built upon the far larger ViT-L/14.

Summary: 
- The article presents a novel SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) to improve video depth super-resolution.
- STDNet comprises two branches: a spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch.
- The spatial difference branch mitigates long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions by aligning RGB features with spatial difference representations for depth calibration.
- The temporal difference branch propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth super-resolution has achieved impressive performance, and the incorporation of multi-frame information further enhances reconstruction quality. Nevertheless, statistical analyses reveal that video depth super-resolution remains affected by pronounced long-tailed distributions, with the long-tailed effects primarily manifesting in spatial non-smooth regions and temporal variation zones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) comprising two core branches: a spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch. In the spatial difference branch, we introduce a spatial difference mechanism to mitigate the long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions. This mechanism dynamically aligns RGB features with learned spatial difference representations, enabling intra-frame RGB-D aggregation for depth calibration. In the temporal difference branch, we further design a temporal difference strategy that preferentially propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to the current depth frame, leveraging temporal difference representations to achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas. Extensive experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our STDNet, outperforming existing approaches.

Summary:
Dataset distillation aims to compress large-scale datasets efficiently. Integration of diffusion generative models helps in this process but can suffer from lack of diversity in sampled images. The proposed Adversary-guided Curriculum Sampling (ACS) approach tackles this issue by partitioning the distilled dataset into multiple curricula. ACS uses an adversarial loss to guide the diffusion sampling process, creating a more diverse distilled dataset and reducing information redundancy. The curriculum sampling progresses from simpler to more complex images, ensuring systematic coverage of target data spectrum. Experiments show that ACS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements on Imagewoof and ImageNet-1k datasets.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.01264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to encapsulate the rich information contained in dataset into a compact distilled dataset but it faces performance degradation as the image-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger. Recent advancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can effectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while maintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution and summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion models are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information redundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a distilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple curricula. For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling process by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled images, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a more diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with the progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more complex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data informational spectrum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ACS, which achieves substantial improvements of 4.1\% on Imagewoof and 2.1\% on ImageNet-1k over the state-of-the-art.

Summary:
Semantic Group Captioning (SGCap) is proposed for zero-shot video captioning, addressing the limitations of existing methods that neglect temporal dynamics and lack video-level supervision. The method incorporates Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) to utilize multi-frame information and model inter-frame temporal relationships. Additionally, Key Sentences Selection (KSS) and Probability Sampling Supervision (PSS) modules are introduced to construct diverse sentence groups and capture inter-sentence causal relationships, enhancing generalization to video captioning. Experimental results show SGCap outperforms previous zero-shot alternatives and competes with fully supervised methods. By leveraging these components, SGCap achieves significant improvements in zero-shot video captioning tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.01270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored. Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships. Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision (PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality, but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%), while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

<title>Integrating Disparity Confidence Estimation into Relative Depth Prior-Guided Unsupervised Stereo Matching</title>

Abstract: Unsupervised stereo matching has garnered significant attention for its independence from costly disparity annotations. Typical unsupervised methods rely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which suffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive patterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D geometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks. However, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information from randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization of 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity estimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to address these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically, the local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their corresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence. Afterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident disparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a dual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance at disparity discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art stereo matching accuracy on the KITTI Stereo benchmarks among all unsupervised stereo matching methods.

<title>GMAT: Grounded Multi-Agent Clinical Description Generation for Text Encoder in Vision-Language MIL for Whole Slide Image Classification</title>

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt, capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer datasets.

Abstract: State-of-the-art stereo matching (SM) models trained on synthetic data often fail to generalize to real data domains due to domain differences, such as color, illumination, contrast, and texture. To address this challenge, we leverage data augmentation to expand the training domain, encouraging the model to acquire robust cross-domain feature representations instead of domain-dependent shortcuts. This paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data augmentation (UgDA) method, which argues that the image statistics in RGB space (mean and standard deviation) carry the domain characteristics. Thus, samples in unseen domains can be generated by properly perturbing these statistics. Furthermore, to simulate more potential domains, Gaussian distributions founded on batch-level statistics are poposed to model the unceratinty of perturbation direction and intensity. Additionally, we further enforce feature consistency between original and augmented data for the same scene, encouraging the model to learn structure aware, shortcuts-invariant feature representations. Our approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and can be integrated into any SM networks. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks have demonstrated that our method can significantly improve the generalization performance of existing SM networks.

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module, to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor (KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder. Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers previous category information and returns category-adaptive representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of 66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD, respectively.

Abstract: We present a novel algebraic solution to the Perspective-Three-Point (P3P) problem, which aims to recover the absolute pose of a calibrated camera from three 2D-3D correspondences. Our method reformulates the problem into a quartic polynomial with coefficients that are analytically simple and computationally efficient. Despite its simplicity, the proposed solver achieves accuracy and runtime performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on synthetic datasets validate its robustness and efficiency. This combination of simplicity and performance makes our solver appealing for both real-time systems and educational contexts, where interpretability and reliability are critical.

<title>Multimodal Attention-Aware Fusion for Diagnosing Distal Myopathy: Evaluating Model Interpretability and Clinician Trust</title>

Abstract: Distal myopathy represents a genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal muscle disorders with broad clinical manifestations, posing diagnostic challenges in radiology. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal attention-aware fusion architecture that combines features extracted from two distinct deep learning models, one capturing global contextual information and the other focusing on local details, representing complementary aspects of the input data. Uniquely, our approach integrates these features through an attention gate mechanism, enhancing both predictive performance and interpretability. Our method achieves a high classification accuracy on the BUSI benchmark and a proprietary distal myopathy dataset, while also generating clinically relevant saliency maps that support transparent decision-making in medical diagnosis. We rigorously evaluated interpretability through (1) functionally grounded metrics, coherence scoring against reference masks and incremental deletion analysis, and (2) application-grounded validation with seven expert radiologists. While our fusion strategy boosts predictive performance relative to single-stream and alternative fusion strategies, both quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal persistent gaps in anatomical specificity and clinical usefulness of the interpretability. These findings highlight the need for richer, context-aware interpretability methods and human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinicians' expectations in real-world diagnostic settings.

Abstract: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction. In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics, achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory speed.

Abstract: This study proposes a zero-shot image segmentation framework for detecting erythema (redness of the skin) using edit-friendly inversion in diffusion models. The method synthesizes reference images of the same patient that are free from erythema via generative editing and then accurately aligns these references with the original images. Color-space analysis is performed with minimal user intervention to identify erythematous regions. This approach significantly reduces the reliance on labeled dermatological datasets while providing a scalable and flexible diagnostic support tool by avoiding the need for any annotated training masks. In our initial qualitative experiments, the pipeline successfully isolated facial erythema in diverse cases, demonstrating performance improvements over baseline threshold-based techniques. These results highlight the potential of combining generative diffusion models and statistical color segmentation for computer-aided dermatology, enabling efficient erythema detection without prior training data.

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images has led to unauthorized usage of personal artwork, which poses a significant threat to the intellectual property of artists. Existing approaches relying on embedding additional information, such as perturbations, watermarks, and backdoors, suffer from limited defensive capabilities and fail to protect artwork published online. In this paper, we propose StyleSentinel, an approach for copyright protection of artwork by verifying an inherent stylistic fingerprint in the artist's artwork. Specifically, we employ a semantic self-reconstruction process to enhance stylistic expressiveness within the artwork, which establishes a dense and style-consistent manifold foundation for feature learning. Subsequently, we adaptively fuse multi-layer image features to encode abstract artistic style into a compact stylistic fingerprint. Finally, we model the target artist's style as a minimal enclosing hypersphere boundary in the feature space, transforming complex copyright verification into a robust one-class learning task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with the state-of-the-art, StyleSentinel achieves superior performance on the one-sample verification task. We also demonstrate the effectiveness through online platforms.

<title>Weakly-Supervised Image Forgery Localization via Vision-Language Collaborative Reasoning Framework</title>

Abstract: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL) has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper, we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations. Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads, where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both detection and localization accuracy.

Abstract: With increasing demand for ride comfort in new energy vehicles, accurate real-time detection of speed bumps and potholes is critical for predictive suspension control. This paper proposes SBP-YOLO, a lightweight detection framework based on YOLOv11, optimized for embedded deployment. The model integrates GhostConv for efficient computation, VoVGSCSPC for multi-scale feature enhancement, and a Lightweight Efficiency Detection Head (LEDH) to reduce early-stage feature processing costs. A hybrid training strategy combining NWD loss, knowledge distillation, and Albumentations-based weather augmentation improves detection robustness, especially for small and distant targets. Experiments show SBP-YOLO achieves 87.0% mAP (outperforming YOLOv11n by 5.8%) and runs at 139.5 FPS on a Jetson AGX Xavier with TensorRT FP16 quantization. The results validate its effectiveness for real-time road condition perception in intelligent suspension systems.

Abstract: Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do. Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame. This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both (\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction (RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction; (\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and training logs are available as the supplement.

Abstract: It is of crucial importance to assess damages promptly and accurately in humanitarian assistance and disaster response (HADR). Current deep learning approaches struggle to generalize effectively due to the imbalance of data classes, scarcity of moderate damage examples, and human inaccuracy in pixel labeling during HADR situations. To accommodate for these limitations and exploit state-of-the-art techniques in vision-language models (VLMs) to fuse imagery with human knowledge understanding, there is an opportunity to generate a diversified set of image-based damage data effectively. Our initial experimental results suggest encouraging data generation quality, which demonstrates an improvement in classifying scenes with different levels of structural damage to buildings, roads, and infrastructures.

Abstract: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression. During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores, filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model, supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the issue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational efficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear attention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight design, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence modeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention computations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the number of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the process of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and computational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this paper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature map sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of key sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention computation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to simulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms. Finally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines it with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT. Through visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO 2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is demonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both inference speed and model accuracy. Notably, the inference speed of LOLViT-X is 5x that of MobileViT-X.

Abstract: Digital terrain maps (DTMs) are an important part of planetary exploration, enabling operations such as terrain relative navigation during entry, descent, and landing for spacecraft and aiding in navigation on the ground. As robotic exploration missions become more ambitious, the need for high quality DTMs will only increase. However, producing DTMs via multi-view stereo pipelines for satellite imagery, the current state-of-the-art, can be cumbersome and require significant manual image preprocessing to produce satisfactory results. In this work, we seek to address these shortcomings by adapting neural volume rendering techniques to learn textured digital terrain maps directly from satellite imagery. Our method, neural terrain maps (NTM), only requires the locus for each image pixel and does not rely on depth or any other structural priors. We demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real satellite data from Earth and Mars encompassing scenes on the order of $100 \textrm{km}^2$. We evaluate the accuracy of our output terrain maps by comparing with existing high-quality DTMs produced using traditional multi-view stereo pipelines. Our method shows promising results, with the precision of terrain prediction almost equal to the resolution of the satellite images even in the presence of imperfect camera intrinsics and extrinsics.

Abstract: Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints, occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery. This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of 91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval (OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues, regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories. Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

<title>Spatial-Frequency Aware for Object Detection in RAW Image</title>

Abstract: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data (unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the ``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma parameters for the two domains.

<title>ForenX: Towards Explainable AI-Generated Image Detection with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Advances in generative models have led to AI-generated images visually indistinguishable from authentic ones. Despite numerous studies on detecting AI-generated images with classifiers, a gap persists between such methods and human cognitive forensic analysis. We present ForenX, a novel method that not only identifies the authenticity of images but also provides explanations that resonate with human thoughts. ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we introduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences in AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based agent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that further enhances our model's performance. We demonstrate that even limited manual annotations significantly improve explanation quality. We evaluate the effectiveness of ForenX on two major benchmarks. The model's explainability is verified by comprehensive subjective evaluations.

<title>3DRot: 3D Rotation Augmentation for RGB-Based 3D Tasks</title>

Abstract: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics, object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7 to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

arXiv:2508.01427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration. (3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

<title>Hyperspectral Image Recovery Constrained by Multi-Granularity Non-Local Self-Similarity Priors</title>

arXiv:2508.01435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery, as an upstream image processing task,
  holds significant importance for downstream tasks such as classification,
  segmentation, and detection. In recent years, HSI recovery methods based on
  non-local prior representations have demonstrated outstanding performance. However,
  these methods employ a fixed-format factor to represent the non-local self-similarity
  tensor groups, making them unable to adapt to diverse missing scenarios. To address
  this issue, we introduce the concept of granularity in tensor decomposition for the first
  time and propose an HSI recovery model constrained by multi-granularity non-local
  self-similarity priors. Specifically, the proposed model alternately performs
  coarse-grained decomposition and fine-grained decomposition on the non-local
  self-similarity tensor groups. Among them, the coarse-grained decomposition builds
  upon Tucker tensor decomposition, which extracts global structural information of the
  image by performing singular value shrinkage on the mode-unfolded matrices. The
  fine-grained decomposition employs the FCTN decomposition, capturing local detail
  information through modeling pairwise correlations among factor tensors. This
  architectural approach achieves a unified representation of global, local, and non-local
  priors for HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has strong
  applicability and exhibits outstanding recovery effects in various types of missing
  scenes such as pixels and stripes.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy, mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25 and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation, Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability, highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.

Abstract: 3D generation has made significant progress, however, it still largely remains at the object-level. Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space, scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes, making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in neuroimaging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor subregions and the high computational cost of volumetric inference. In this paper, we propose EfficientGFormer, a novel architecture that integrates pretrained foundation models with graph-based reasoning and lightweight efficiency mechanisms for robust 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our framework leverages nnFormer as a modality-aware encoder, transforming multi-modal MRI volumes into patch-level embeddings. These features are structured into a dual-edge graph that captures both spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A pruned, edge-type-aware Graph Attention Network (GAT) enables efficient relational reasoning across tumor subregions, while a distillation module transfers knowledge from a full-capacity teacher to a compact student model for real-time deployment. Experiments on the MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that EfficientGFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced memory and inference time, outperforming recent transformer-based and graph-based baselines. This work offers a clinically viable solution for fast and accurate volumetric tumor delineation, combining scalability, interpretability, and generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection (MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability. Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even against unseen generators like Sora.

Abstract: While recent multimodal models have shown progress in vision-language tasks, small-scale variants still struggle with the fine-grained temporal reasoning required for video understanding. We introduce ReasonAct, a method that enhances video reasoning in smaller models through a three-stage training process: first building a foundation with text-only reasoning, then fine-tuning on video, and finally refining with temporal-aware reinforcement learning. We build upon Temporal Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) by incorporating temporal consistency modeling into policy optimization. We also propose a biomechanically-motivated sub-action decomposition mechanism that provides graduated rewards for constituent action phases. Through experiments on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, our 3B-parameter model achieves 67.2%, 94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy respectively, demonstrating improvements of 17.9, 15.8, and 12.3 points over baselines. Ablation studies validate that our progressive training methodology enables smaller models to achieve competitive video reasoning performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in recent years, enabling a diverse array of applications in everyday life. However, the substantial computational and storage demands of VLMs pose significant challenges for their efficient deployment on mobile devices, which represent the most ubiquitous and accessible computing platforms today. In this work, we introduce MagicVL-2B, a novel VLM meticulously optimized for flagship smartphones. MagicVL-2B leverages a lightweight visual encoder with fewer than 100M parameters and features a redesigned dynamic resolution scheme that adaptively generates image tokens without excessive modification of image dimensions. To further enhance the performance of this compact encoder within VLMs, we propose a multimodal curriculum learning strategy that incrementally increases task difficulty and data information density throughout training. This approach substantially improves the model's performance across a variety of sub-tasks. Extensive evaluations on standard VLM benchmarks demonstrate that MagicVL-2B matches the accuracy of current state-of-the-art models while reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%. These results establish MagicVL-2B as a practical and robust solution for real-world mobile vision-language applications, enabling advanced multimodal intelligence to run directly on smartphones.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled substantial progress in video understanding by leveraging cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, their effectiveness is limited by the restricted context window and the high computational cost required to process long videos with thousands of frames. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by selecting only the most relevant frames as input, thereby reducing the computational burden. Nevertheless, existing video RAG methods struggle to balance retrieval efficiency and accuracy, particularly when handling diverse and complex video content. To address these limitations, we propose E-VRAG, a novel and efficient video RAG framework for video understanding. We first apply a frame pre-filtering method based on hierarchical query decomposition to eliminate irrelevant frames, reducing computational costs at the data level. We then employ a lightweight VLM for frame scoring, further reducing computational costs at the model level. Additionally, we propose a frame retrieval strategy that leverages the global statistical distribution of inter-frame scores to mitigate the potential performance degradation from using a lightweight VLM. Finally, we introduce a multi-view question answering scheme for the retrieved frames, enhancing the VLM's capability to extract and comprehend information from long video contexts. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that E-VRAG achieves about 70% reduction in computational cost and higher accuracy compared to baseline methods, all without additional training. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of E-VRAG in improving both efficiency and accuracy for video RAG tasks.

arXiv:2508.01548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual token compression is critical for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to efficiently process high-resolution inputs. Existing methods that typically adopt fixed compression ratios cannot adapt to scenes of varying complexity, often causing imprecise pruning that discards informative visual tokens and results in degraded model performance. To address this issue, we introduce a dynamic pruning framework, GlimpsePrune, inspired by human cognition. It takes a data-driven ''glimpse'' and prunes irrelevant visual tokens in a single forward pass before answer generation. This approach prunes 92.6% of visual tokens while on average fully retaining the baseline performance on free-form VQA tasks. The reduced computational cost also enables more effective fine-tuning: an enhanced GlimpsePrune+ achieves 110% of the baseline performance while maintaining a similarly high pruning rate. Our work paves a new way for building more powerful and efficient LVLMs.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been exploited in various Computer Vision tasks (e.g., few-shot recognition) via model adaptation, such as prompt tuning and adapters. However, existing adaptation methods are designed by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience. Inspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code generation, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation (EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation algorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as the key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential manner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search space through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability and efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion, web based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective automatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the algorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous manually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification setting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in recognition accuracy. This research opens new possibilities for automating the optimization of adaptation algorithms of pre-trained multimodal models. Code is available at: https://github.com/kding1225/EvoVLMA

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense, stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes. This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption, limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network, which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion methods with dense LiDAR scanning.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks with their exceptional performance. However, the introduction of privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models. Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.

<title>TopoImages: Incorporating Local Topology Encoding into Deep Learning Models for Medical Image Classification</title>

Abstract: Topological structures in image data, such as connected components and loops, play a crucial role in understanding image content (e.g., biomedical objects). %
Despite remarkable successes of numerous image processing methods that rely on appearance information, these methods often lack sensitivity to topological structures when used in general deep learning (DL) frameworks. %
In this paper, we introduce a new general approach, called TopoImages (for Topology Images), which computes a new representation of input images by encoding local topology of patches. %
In TopoImages, we leverage persistent homology (PH) to encode geometric and topological features inherent in image patches. %
Our main objective is to capture topological information in local patches of an input image into a vectorized form. %
Specifically, we first compute persistence diagrams (PDs) of the patches, %
and then vectorize and arrange these PDs into long vectors for pixels of the patches. %
The resulting multi-channel image-form representation is called a TopoImage. %
TopoImages offers a new perspective for data analysis. %
To garner diverse and significant topological features in image data and ensure a more comprehensive and enriched representation, we further generate multiple TopoImages of the input image using various filtration functions, which we call multi-view TopoImages. %
The multi-view TopoImages are fused with the input image for DL-based classification, with considerable improvement. %
Our TopoImages approach is highly versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into common DL frameworks. Experiments on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate noticeably improved accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored. During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation (SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier. Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the concept of Set Pivot Learning, a paradigm shift that redefines domain generalization (DG) based on Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Traditional DG assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, trained on vast and diverse data, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. Traditional DG assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, which are trained on vast and diverse datasets, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. To address this challenge, we propose Set Pivot Learning (SPL), a new definition of domain migration task based on VFMs, which is more suitable for current research and application requirements. Unlike conventional DG methods, SPL prioritizes adaptive refinement over rigid domain transfer, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving real-world conditions. Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic adaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven feature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii) VFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone task-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness. Building on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines a Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate VFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.

Abstract: Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields, existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition, the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution (GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently, replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this, exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other replay-based methods, respectively.

<title>Self-Navigated Residual Mamba for Universal Industrial Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages ``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions. Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD, MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

arXiv:2508.01592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art results. Code will be available.

<title>CLIMD: A Curriculum Learning Framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis</title>

Abstract: Clinicians usually combine information from multiple sources to achieve the most accurate diagnosis, and this has sparked increasing interest in leveraging multimodal deep learning for diagnosis. However, in real clinical scenarios, due to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face the issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the features of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with resampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or underfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we propose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis (CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that combines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal complementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually adapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class distribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model to progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training. Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various metrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore, as a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other models, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis accuracy. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/KHan-UJS/CLIMD.

<title>Enhancing Zero-Shot Brain Tumor Subtype Classification via Fine-Grained Patch-Text Alignment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited, resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules: (1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions, FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

<title>Towards Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection via Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major struggle for AI-generated image detection is identifying fake images from unseen generators. Existing cutting-edge methods typically customize pre-trained foundation models to this task via partial-parameter fine-tuning. However, these parameters trained on a narrow range of generators may fail to generalize to unknown sources. In light of this, we propose a novel framework named Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), which enhances flexibility in processing diverse testing images. It consists of two adaptive modules, i.e., the Conditional Information Learner and the Confidence-Driven Adaptive Prediction. The former employs CNN-based feature extractors to learn forgery-specific and image-specific conditions, which are then propagated to learnable tokens via a gated mechanism. The latter optimizes the shallowest learnable tokens based on a single test sample and selects the cropped view with the highest prediction confidence for final detection. These two modules enable the prompts fed into the foundation model to be automatically adjusted based on the input image, rather than being fixed after training, thereby enhancing the model's adaptability to various forged images. Extensive experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 95.61% and 96.7% mean accuracy on two widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage datasets, respectively.

<title>From Pixels to Places: A Systematic Benchmark for Evaluating Image Geolocalization Ability in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of identifying the geographic location depicted in an image, is important for applications in crisis response, digital forensics, and location-based intelligence. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for visual reasoning, their ability to perform image geolocalization remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce a benchmark called IMAGEO-Bench that systematically evaluates accuracy, distance error, geospatial bias, and reasoning process. Our benchmark includes three diverse datasets covering global street scenes, points of interest (POIs) in the United States, and a private collection of unseen images. Through experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open- and closed-source models, we reveal clear performance disparities, with closed-source models generally showing stronger reasoning. Importantly, we uncover geospatial biases as LLMs tend to perform better in high-resource regions (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and California) while exhibiting degraded performance in underrepresented areas. Regression diagnostics demonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on recognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and identifiable landmarks. Overall, IMAGEO-Bench provides a rigorous lens into the spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers implications for building geolocation-aware AI systems.

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of biomedical vision-language models (VLMs). Recently, masked diffusion models such as LLaDA have emerged as promising alternatives, yet their application in the biomedical domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{LLaDA-MedV}, the first large language diffusion model tailored for biomedical image understanding through vision instruction tuning. LLaDA-MedV achieves relative performance gains of 7.855\% over LLaVA-Med and 1.867\% over LLaDA-V in the open-ended biomedical visual conversation task, and sets new state-of-the-art accuracy on the closed-form subset of three VQA benchmarks: 84.93\% on VQA-RAD, 92.31\% on SLAKE, and 95.15\% on PathVQA. Furthermore, a detailed comparison with LLaVA-Med suggests that LLaDA-MedV is capable of generating reasonably longer responses by explicitly controlling response length, which can lead to more informative outputs. We also conduct an in-depth analysis of both the training and inference stages, highlighting the critical roles of initialization weight selection, fine-tuning strategies, and the interplay between sampling steps and response repetition. The code and model weight is released at https://github.com/LLM-VLM-GSL/LLaDA-MedV.

<title>Rate-distortion Optimized Point Cloud Preprocessing for Geometry-based Point Cloud Compression</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC), an international standard designed by MPEG, provides a generic framework for compressing diverse types of point clouds while ensuring interoperability across applications and devices. However, G-PCC underperforms compared to recent deep learning-based PCC methods despite its lower computational power consumption. To enhance the efficiency of G-PCC without sacrificing its interoperability or computational flexibility, we propose a novel preprocessing framework that integrates a compression-oriented voxelization network with a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly optimized in the training phase. The surrogate model mimics the rate-distortion behaviour of the non-differentiable G-PCC codec, enabling end-to-end gradient propagation. The versatile voxelization network adaptively transforms input point clouds using learning-based voxelization and effectively manipulates point clouds via global scaling, fine-grained pruning, and point-level editing for rate-distortion trade-offs. During inference, only the lightweight voxelization network is appended to the G-PCC encoder, requiring no modifications to the decoder, thus introducing no computational overhead for end users. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction over G-PCC. By bridging classical codecs with deep learning, this work offers a practical pathway to enhance legacy compression standards while preserving their backward compatibility, making it ideal for real-world deployment.

Abstract: We address the problem of glass surface segmentation with an RGB-D camera, with a focus on effectively fusing RGB and depth information. To this end, we propose a Weighted Feature Fusion (WFF) module that dynamically and adaptively combines RGB and depth features to tackle issues such as transparency, reflections, and occlusions. This module can be seamlessly integrated with various deep neural network backbones as a plug-and-play solution. Additionally, we introduce the MJU-Glass dataset, a comprehensive RGB-D dataset collected by a service robot navigating real-world environments, providing a valuable benchmark for evaluating segmentation models. Experimental results show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness, with the WFF module enhancing performance in both mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and boundary IoU (bIoU), achieving a 7.49% improvement in bIoU when integrated with PSPNet. The proposed module and dataset provide a robust framework for advancing glass surface segmentation in robotics and reducing the risk of collisions with glass objects.

<title>Minimal High-Resolution Patches Are Sufficient for Whole Slide Image Representation via Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01641</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches. This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over 10,000,000 patches.

Abstract: Realistic hair strand generation is crucial for applications like computer graphics and virtual reality. While diffusion models can generate hairstyles from text or images, these inputs lack precision and user-friendliness. Instead, we propose the first sketch-based strand generation model, which offers finer control while remaining user-friendly. Our framework tackles key challenges, such as modeling complex strand interactions and diverse sketch patterns, through two main innovations: a learnable strand upsampling strategy that encodes 3D strands into multi-scale latent spaces, and a multi-scale adaptive conditioning mechanism using a transformer with diffusion heads to ensure consistency across granularity levels. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show our method outperforms existing approaches in realism and precision. Qualitative results further confirm its effectiveness. Code will be released at [GitHub](https://github.com/fighting-Zhang/StrandDesigner).

Abstract: 3D object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d object, which is crucial for human-object interaction, human-robot interaction, embodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem via learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find that such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We further introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to endow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of the map-level decoding strategy.

<title>Single Point, Full Mask: Velocity-Guided Level Set Evolution for End-to-End Amodal Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Amodal segmentation aims to recover complete object shapes, including occluded regions with no visual appearance, whereas conventional segmentation focuses solely on visible areas. Existing methods typically rely on strong prompts, such as visible masks or bounding boxes, which are costly or impractical to obtain in real-world settings. While recent approaches such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they often perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape evolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios. Moreover, most existing methods suffer from a black-box nature, lacking geometric interpretability and offering limited insight into how occluded shapes are inferred. To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end VElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit contour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial level set function from image features and the point input, which then progressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a shape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This network learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling geometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling. Extensive experiments on COCOA-cls, D2SA, and KINS benchmarks demonstrate that VELA outperforms existing strongly prompted methods while requiring only a single-point prompt, validating the effectiveness of interpretable geometric modeling under weak guidance. The code will be publicly released.

<title>Shape Distribution Matters: Shape-specific Mixture-of-Experts for Amodal Segmentation under Diverse Occlusions</title>

arXiv:2508.01664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amodal segmentation targets to predict complete object masks, covering both visible and occluded regions. This task poses significant challenges due to complex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly deformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single model to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to adopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different shape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's underlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and insufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized experts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to learn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a lightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically, ShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures key shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to the most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert routing. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting occluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well interpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining high capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show that ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in occluded region segmentation. The code will be released.

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various computer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as segmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM pre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation scenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To overcome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based segmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited data and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios. Specifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a domain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable, instance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the segmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of the backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the Rein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and logit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic transfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment anything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated Rein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g., daytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g., nighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with efficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and adaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of parameters.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models. We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as 2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to 13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.

<title>Cure or Poison? Embedding Instructions Visually Alters Hallucination in Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01678</link>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from hallucination, partly due to challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance, increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly. Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.

<title>DisCo3D: Distilling Multi-View Consistency for 3D Scene Editing</title>

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in 2D image generation and editing, extending these capabilities to 3D editing remains challenging, particularly in maintaining multi-view consistency. Classical approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D}, a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing quality.

<title>Register Anything: Estimating "Corresponding Prompts" for Segment Anything Model</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01697</link>

arXiv:2508.01697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Establishing pixel/voxel-level or region-level correspondences is the core challenge in image registration. The latter, also known as region-based correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images. In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly "searching for corresponding prompts", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models (e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we introduce the "corresponding prompt problem", which aims to identify a corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X, such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an "inverse prompt" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts, inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and, as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.

Abstract: Leveraging text, images, structure maps, or motion trajectories as conditional guidance, diffusion models have achieved great success in automated and high-quality video generation. However, generating smooth and rational transition videos given the first and last video frames as well as descriptive text prompts is far underexplored. We present VTG, a Versatile Transition video Generation framework that can generate smooth, high-fidelity, and semantically coherent video transitions. VTG introduces interpolation-based initialization that helps preserve object identity and handle abrupt content changes effectively. In addition, it incorporates dual-directional motion fine-tuning and representation alignment regularization to mitigate the limitations of pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models in motion smoothness and generation fidelity, respectively. To evaluate VTG and facilitate future studies on unified transition generation, we collected TransitBench, a comprehensive benchmark for transition generation covering two representative transition tasks: concept blending and scene transition. Extensive experiments show that VTG achieves superior transition performance consistently across all four tasks.

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to precisely identify video event segments in response to textual queries. The outputs of VTG tasks manifest as sequences of events, each defined by precise timestamps, saliency scores, and textual descriptions. Despite recent advances, a fundamental limitation persists in existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs): they process all task tokens through identical and static pathways, failing to recognize that temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation represent fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. To address this, we introduce TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Video-LLM that effectively decomposes VTG tasks by dynamically routing task-specific tokens (e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, with increased computational efficiency. Our design choices enable precise handling of each subtask, leading to improved event modeling across diverse VTG applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeExpert consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on various VTG tasks such as Dense Video Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.

<title>LT-Gaussian: Long-Term Map Update Using 3D Gaussian Splatting for Autonomous Driving</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01704</link>

arXiv:2508.01704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maps play an important role in autonomous driving systems. The recently proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components: Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently, during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch. Our open-source code is available at https://github.com/ChengLuqi/LT-gaussian.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID, a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and (ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations. Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in videos remains challenging due to the complexity of multimodal content and the lack of fine-grained annotations in existing datasets. We present HateClipSeg, a large-scale multimodal dataset with both video-level and segment-level annotations, comprising over 11,714 segments labeled as Normal or across five Offensive categories: Hateful, Insulting, Sexual, Violence, Self-Harm, along with explicit target victim labels. Our three-stage annotation process yields high inter-annotator agreement (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.817). We propose three tasks to benchmark performance: (1) Trimmed Hateful Video Classification, (2) Temporal Hateful Video Localization, and (3) Online Hateful Video Classification. Results highlight substantial gaps in current models, emphasizing the need for more sophisticated multimodal and temporally aware approaches. The HateClipSeg dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Social-AI-Studio/HateClipSeg.git.

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work, we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than 144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at http://topics.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

arXiv:2508.01728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep vision models have achieved remarkable classification performance by leveraging a hierarchical architecture in which human-interpretable concepts emerge through the composition of individual neurons across layers. Given the distributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual concepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In this paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular Concept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a given query. To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound, concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level. We validate the versatility and effectiveness of GCCs across various deep image classification models.

<title>Tracking the Unstable: Appearance-Guided Motion Modeling for Robust Multi-Object Tracking in UAV-Captured Videos</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency (AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically, the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions, thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.

Abstract: Recent advances in Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) have led to significant breakthroughs in the field. While many RSFMs have been pretrained with massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack of the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral imagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be effectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring extensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed SpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt existing RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to handle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain generalization performance. In the first stage, we employ a masked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to extract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions. Simultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA) that dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing layer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the second stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the first stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with high-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial attributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase adaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from new regions or seasons. The codes will be available from the website: https://github.com/YuxiangZhang-BIT.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has witnessed exponential adoption across diverse applications, driving a critical need for semantic-aware 3D Gaussian representations to enable scene understanding and editing tasks. Existing approaches typically attach semantic features to a collection of free Gaussians and distill the features via differentiable rendering, leading to noisy segmentation and a messy selection of Gaussians. In this paper, we introduce AG$^2$aussian, a novel framework that leverages an anchor-graph structure to organize semantic features and regulate Gaussian primitives. Our anchor-graph structure not only promotes compact and instance-aware Gaussian distributions, but also facilitates graph-based propagation, achieving a clean and accurate instance-level Gaussian selection. Extensive validation across four applications, i.e. interactive click-based query, open-vocabulary text-driven query, object removal editing, and physics simulation, demonstrates the advantages of our approach and its benefits to various applications. The experiments and ablation studies further evaluate the effectiveness of the key designs of our approach.

<title>Simulated Ensemble Attack: Transferring Jailbreaks Across Fine-tuned Vision-Language Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) creates a critical yet underexplored attack surface: vulnerabilities in the base VLM could be retained in fine-tuned variants, rendering them susceptible to transferable jailbreak attacks. To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack (SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training configuration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA combines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images by simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual strategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized outputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA achieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates near 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically fine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image jailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits inherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing transferability. These findings highlight an urgent need to safeguard fine-tuned proprietary VLMs against transferable vulnerabilities inherited from open-source foundations, motivating the development of holistic defenses across the entire model lifecycle.

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation from egocentric video is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and assistive technologies, where anticipating user intent enables proactive and context-aware AI assistance. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: 1) underutilization of fine-grained visual cues from hand-object interactions, 2) neglect of semantic dependencies between verbs and nouns, and 3) lack of explicit cognitive reasoning, limiting generalization and long-term forecasting ability. To overcome these challenges, we propose INSIGHT, a unified two-stage framework for egocentric action anticipation. In the first stage, INSIGHT focuses on extracting semantically rich features from hand-object interaction regions and enhances action representations using a verb-noun co-occurrence matrix. In the second stage, it introduces a reinforcement learning-based module that simulates explicit cognitive reasoning through a structured process: visual perception (think) -> intention inference (reason) -> action anticipation (answer). Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks show that INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

<title>Improving Noise Efficiency in Privacy-preserving Dataset Distillation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns. Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation, Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with 50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth} the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.

Abstract: Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques, including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory. Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction through activity quantification and behavioural classification.

Abstract: While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation.

<title>DiffSemanticFusion: Semantic Raster BEV Fusion for Autonomous Driving via Online HD Map Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road geometry, traffic agents, and their semantic relationships. In online HD map generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition, extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show that our map diffusion module can be seamlessly integrated into other vector-based approaches to enhance performance. All artifacts are available at https://github.com/SunZhigang7/DiffSemanticFusion.

<title>Skip priors and add graph-based anatomical information, for point-based Couinaud segmentation</title>

Abstract: The preoperative planning of liver surgery relies on Couinaud segmentation from computed tomography (CT) images, to reduce the risk of bleeding and guide the resection procedure. Using 3D point-based representations, rather than voxelizing the CT volume, has the benefit of preserving the physical resolution of the CT. However, point-based representations need prior knowledge of the liver vessel structure, which is time consuming to acquire. Here, we propose a point-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the prior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver vessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features. This adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities across point neighborhoods. Our method is competitive on the MSD and LiTS public datasets in Dice coefficient and average surface distance scores compared to four pioneering point-based methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhangXiaotong015/GrPn.

<title>CSLRConformer: A Data-Centric Conformer Approach for Continuous Arabic Sign Language Recognition on the Isharah Datase</title>

arXiv:2508.01791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed, centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline, and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in keypoint-based CSLR.

Abstract: While 3D hand reconstruction from monocular images has made significant progress, generating accurate and temporally coherent motion estimates from videos remains challenging, particularly during hand-object interactions. In this paper, we present a novel 3D hand motion recovery framework that enhances image-based reconstructions through a diffusion-based and physics-augmented motion refinement model. Our model captures the distribution of refined motion estimates conditioned on initial ones, generating improved sequences through an iterative denoising process. Instead of relying on scarce annotated video data, we train our model only using motion capture data without images. We identify valuable intuitive physics knowledge during hand-object interactions, including key motion states and their associated motion constraints. We effectively integrate these physical insights into our diffusion model to improve its performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves various frame-wise reconstruction methods, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on existing benchmarks.

<title>A Simple Algebraic Solution for Estimating the Pose of a Camera from Planar Point Features</title>

arXiv:2508.01836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a simple algebraic method to estimate the pose of a camera relative to a planar target from $n \geq 4$ reference points with known coordinates in the target frame and their corresponding bearing measurements in the camera frame. The proposed approach follows a hierarchical structure; first, the unit vector normal to the target plane is determined, followed by the camera's position vector, its distance to the target plane, and finally, the full orientation. To improve the method's robustness to measurement noise, an averaging methodology is introduced to refine the estimation of the target's normal direction. The accuracy and robustness of the approach are validated through extensive experiments.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent out-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks and 10 datasets (Fig.1). Code will be ready in https://github.com/Wickyan/OmniEvent .

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against computer vision systems have emerged as a critical research area that challenges the fundamental assumptions about neural network robustness and security. This comprehensive survey examines the evolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as both sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a systematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary domains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space attacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early gradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization techniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced transferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have successfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world threats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical perturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks that leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more transferable and meaningful adversarial examples. Beyond traditional offensive applications, we investigate the constructive use of adversarial techniques for vulnerability assessment in biometric authentication systems and protection against malicious generative models. Our analysis reveals critical research gaps, particularly in neural style transfer protection and computational efficiency requirements. This survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy, evolution analysis, and identification of future research directions, aiming to advance understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities and inform the development of more robust and trustworthy computer vision systems.

<title>Context Guided Transformer Entropy Modeling for Video Compression</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01852</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional entropy model.

<title>Distinguishing Target and Non-Target Fixations with EEG and Eye Tracking in Realistic Visual Scenes</title>

Abstract: Distinguishing target from non-target fixations during visual search is a fundamental building block to understand users' intended actions and to build effective assistance systems. While prior research indicated the feasibility of classifying target vs. non-target fixations based on eye tracking and electroencephalography (EEG) data, these studies were conducted with explicitly instructed search trajectories, abstract visual stimuli, and disregarded any scene context. This is in stark contrast with the fact that human visual search is largely driven by scene characteristics and raises questions regarding generalizability to more realistic scenarios. To close this gap, we, for the first time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations during free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a 36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search scenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on desktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach based on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related potentials. We perform extensive evaluations to assess the generalizability of our approach across scene types. Our approach significantly advances the ability to distinguish between target and non-target fixations in realistic scenarios, achieving 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations. This substantially outperforms previous methods based on saccade-related potentials, which reached only 56.9% accuracy.

arXiv:2508.01873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation techniques demands robust and accurate face forgery detection algorithms. While determining whether an image has been manipulated remains essential, the ability to precisely localize forgery artifacts has become increasingly important for improving model explainability and fostering user trust. To address this challenge, we propose DiffusionFF, a novel framework that enhances face forgery detection through diffusion-based artifact localization. Our method utilizes a denoising diffusion model to generate high-quality Structural Dissimilarity (DSSIM) maps, which effectively capture subtle traces of manipulation. These DSSIM maps are then fused with high-level semantic features extracted by a pretrained forgery detector, leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that DiffusionFF not only achieves superior detection performance but also offers precise and fine-grained artifact localization, highlighting its overall effectiveness.

arXiv:2508.01875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.

<title>Medical Image De-Identification Resources: Synthetic DICOM Data and Tools for Validation</title>

Abstract: Medical imaging research increasingly depends on large-scale data sharing to promote reproducibility and train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Ensuring patient privacy remains a significant challenge for open-access data sharing. Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), the global standard data format for medical imaging, encodes both essential clinical metadata and extensive protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII). Effective de-identification must remove identifiers, preserve scientific utility, and maintain DICOM validity. Tools exist to perform de-identification, but few assess its effectiveness, and most rely on subjective reviews, limiting reproducibility and regulatory confidence. To address this gap, we developed an openly accessible DICOM dataset infused with synthetic PHI/PII and an evaluation framework for benchmarking image de-identification workflows. The Medical Image de-identification (MIDI) dataset was built using publicly available de-identified data from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). It includes 538 subjects (216 for validation, 322 for testing), 605 studies, 708 series, and 53,581 DICOM image instances. These span multiple vendors, imaging modalities, and cancer types. Synthetic PHI and PII were embedded into structured data elements, plain text data elements, and pixel data to simulate real-world identity leaks encountered by TCIA curation teams. Accompanying evaluation tools include a Python script, answer keys (known truth), and mapping files that enable automated comparison of curated data against expected transformations. The framework is aligned with the HIPAA Privacy Rule "Safe Harbor" method, DICOM PS3.15 Confidentiality Profiles, and TCIA best practices. It supports objective, standards-driven evaluation of de-identification workflows, promoting safer and more consistent medical image sharing.

<title>EgoTrigger: Toward Audio-Driven Image Capture for Human Memory Enhancement in All-Day Energy-Efficient Smart Glasses</title>

Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach, EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components (e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use -- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (VLMs) promise to streamline computer vision pipelines by reframing multiple visual tasks such as classification, detection, and keypoint localization within a single language-driven interface. This architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial inspections.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is critical in biomedical imaging to accurately distinguish individual objects like cells, which often overlap and vary in size. Recent query-based methods, where object queries guide segmentation, have shown strong performance. While U-Net has been a go-to architecture in medical image segmentation, its potential in query-based approaches remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present IAUNet, a novel query-based U-Net architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally, we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images, setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell instance segmentation tasks.

<title>Proactive Disentangled Modeling of Trigger-Object Pairings for Backdoor Defense</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01932</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.01932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training pipelines.

Abstract: We present a novel multi-altitude camera pose estimation system, addressing the challenges of robust and accurate localization across varied altitudes when only considering sparse image input. The system effectively handles diverse environmental conditions and viewpoint variations by integrating the cross-view transformer, deep features, and structure-from-motion into a unified framework. To benchmark our method and foster further research, we introduce two newly collected datasets specifically tailored for multi-altitude camera pose estimation; datasets of this nature remain rare in the current literature. The proposed framework has been validated through extensive comparative analyses on these datasets, demonstrating that our system achieves superior performance in both accuracy and robustness for multi-altitude sparse pose estimation tasks compared to existing solutions, making it well suited for real-world robotic applications such as aerial navigation, search and rescue, and automated inspection.

Abstract: One-stage object detectors such as the YOLO family achieve state-of-the-art performance in real-time vision applications but remain heavily reliant on large-scale labeled datasets for training. In this work, we present a systematic study of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) as a means to reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders, employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance, especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8 achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for label-efficient object detection.

Abstract: Point clouds are essential for object modeling and play a critical role in assisting driving tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the significant volume of data generated by AVs creates challenges for storage, bandwidth, and processing cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a representative point selection framework for point cloud downsampling, which preserves critical object-related information while effectively filtering out irrelevant background points. Our method involves two steps: (1) Object Presence Detection, where we introduce an unsupervised density peak-based classifier and a supervised Na\"ive Bayes classifier to handle diverse scenarios, and (2) Sampling Budget Allocation, where we propose a strategy that selects object-relevant points while maintaining a high retention rate of object information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and effectiveness across varying sampling rates. As a model-agnostic solution, our approach integrates seamlessly with diverse downstream models, making it a valuable and scalable addition to the 3D point cloud downsampling toolkit for AV applications.

Abstract: Existing human motion Q\&amp;A methods rely on explicit program execution, where the requirement for manually defined functional modules may limit the scalability and adaptability. To overcome this, we propose an implicit program-guided motion reasoning (IMoRe) framework that unifies reasoning across multiple query types without manually designed modules. Unlike existing implicit reasoning approaches that infer reasoning operations from question words, our model directly conditions on structured program functions, ensuring a more precise execution of reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a program-guided reading mechanism, which dynamically selects multi-level motion representations from a pretrained motion Vision Transformer (ViT), capturing both high-level semantics and fine-grained motion cues. The reasoning module iteratively refines memory representations, leveraging structured program functions to extract relevant information for different query types. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on Babel-QA and generalizes to a newly constructed motion Q\&amp;A dataset based on HuMMan, demonstrating its adaptability across different motion reasoning datasets. Code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/LUNAProject22/IMoRe.

Abstract: As the application of deep learning in dermatology continues to grow, the recognition of melanoma has garnered significant attention, demonstrating potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. Despite advancements in image classification techniques, existing models still face challenges in identifying subtle visual cues that differentiate melanoma from benign lesions. This paper presents a novel Deeply Dual Supervised Learning framework that integrates local and global feature extraction to enhance melanoma recognition. By employing a dual-pathway structure, the model focuses on both fine-grained local features and broader contextual information, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the image content. The framework utilizes a dual attention mechanism that dynamically emphasizes critical features, thereby reducing the risk of overlooking subtle characteristics of melanoma. Additionally, we introduce a multi-scale feature aggregation strategy to ensure robust performance across varying image resolutions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in melanoma detection, achieving higher accuracy and better resilience against false positives. This work lays the foundation for future research in automated skin cancer recognition and highlights the effectiveness of dual supervised learning in medical image analysis.

<title>Fast and Memory-efficient Non-line-of-sight Imaging with Quasi-Fresnel Transform</title>

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging seeks to reconstruct hidden objects by analyzing reflections from intermediary surfaces. Existing methods typically model both the measurement data and the hidden scene in three dimensions, overlooking the inherently two-dimensional nature of most hidden objects. This oversight leads to high computational costs and substantial memory consumption, limiting practical applications and making real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging on lightweight devices challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that represents the hidden scene using two-dimensional functions and employs a Quasi-Fresnel transform to establish a direct inversion formula between the measurement data and the hidden scene. This transformation leverages the two-dimensional characteristics of the problem to significantly reduce computational complexity and memory requirements. Our algorithm efficiently performs fast transformations between these two-dimensional aggregated data, enabling rapid reconstruction of hidden objects with minimal memory usage. Compared to existing methods, our approach reduces runtime and memory demands by several orders of magnitude while maintaining imaging quality. The substantial reduction in memory usage not only enhances computational efficiency but also enables NLOS imaging on lightweight devices such as mobile and embedded systems. We anticipate that this method will facilitate real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging and broaden its applicability across a wider range of platforms.

<title>Devil is in the Detail: Towards Injecting Fine Details of Image Prompt in Image Generation via Conflict-free Guidance and Stratified Attention</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02004</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of high-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to capture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt. This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer, generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance. Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully reflecting the image prompt.

<title>Bench2ADVLM: A Closed-Loop Benchmark for Vision-language Models in Autonomous Driving</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02028</link>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience, and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design, heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution. Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop conditions.

<title>Protego: User-Centric Pose-Invariant Privacy Protection Against Face Recognition-Induced Digital Footprint Exposure</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02034</link>

arXiv:2508.02034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale image retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like Clearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a large amount of online content associated with that person. This not only enables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as social media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their consent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a user-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such retrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial signatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically deformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of any facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by a critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of FR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves. Experiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a wide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing methods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video settings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall, Protego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance and unsolicited identity tracing.

Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning often relies on time-consuming, trial-and-error adjustments that heavily depend on the expertise of specialists, while existing deep learning methods face limitations in generalization, prediction accuracy, and clinical applicability. To tackle these challenges, we propose ADDiff-Dose, an Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints Conditional Diffusion Model for end-to-end multi-tumor dose prediction. The model employs LightweightVAE3D to compress high-dimensional CT data and integrates multimodal inputs, including target and organ-at-risk (OAR) masks and beam parameters, within a progressive noise addition and denoising framework. It incorporates conditional features via a multi-head attention mechanism and utilizes a composite loss function combining MSE, conditional terms, and KL divergence to ensure both dosimetric accuracy and compliance with clinical constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale public dataset (2,877 cases) and three external institutional cohorts (450 cases in total) demonstrates that ADDiff-Dose significantly outperforms traditional baselines, achieving an MAE of 0.101-0.154 (compared to 0.316 for UNet and 0.169 for GAN models), a DICE coefficient of 0.927 (a 6.8% improvement), and limiting spinal cord maximum dose error to within 0.1 Gy. The average plan generation time per case is reduced to 22 seconds. Ablation studies confirm that the structural encoder enhances compliance with clinical dose constraints by 28.5%. To our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a conditional diffusion model framework for radiotherapy dose prediction, offering a generalizable and efficient solution for automated treatment planning across diverse tumor sites, with the potential to substantially reduce planning time and improve clinical workflow efficiency.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality fine-grained annotations for traffic signs is critical for accurate and safe decision-making in autonomous driving. Widely used datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs (MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further, we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2 model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic matching in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset and evaluation framework pave the way for more reliable, interpretable, and scalable perception systems.

Abstract: Distributed multi-stage image compression -- where visual content traverses multiple processing nodes under varying quality requirements -- poses challenges. Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency; fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage image compression system. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge quantization principle through differential entropy analysis. The configuration based on this principle demonstrates up to 0.6dB PSNR gains over other configurations. When comprehensively evaluated on the Kodak, CLIC, and CLIC2020-mobile datasets, HCF outperforms successive-compression methods by up to 5.56% BD-Rate in PSNR on CLIC, while saving up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU memory, and 90.0% execution time. It also outperforms state-of-the-art progressive compression methods by up to 12.64% BD-Rate on Kodak and enables retraining-free cross-quality adaptation with 7.13-10.87% BD-Rate reductions on CLIC2020-mobile.

<title>StarPose: 3D Human Pose Estimation via Spatial-Temporal Autoregressive Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation.

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) for diagnostic images, such as chest X-rays, plays a pivotal role in both clinical practice and AI. Traditional free-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language, complicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology report generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information into standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on classification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require predefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based approaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence patterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important details. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes dataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation framework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that includes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical locations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and well-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized, high-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized evaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy but also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a clinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements critical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with human assessments. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of structured reports and the importance of a tailored evaluation metric for S-RRG, providing a more clinically relevant measure of report quality.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track and reason about object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts-abilities essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in current VLMs. In this paper, we introduce VLM4D, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of VLMs. Our benchmark comprises diverse real-world and synthetic videos accompanied by carefully curated question-answer pairs emphasizing translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Real-time synthesis of physically plausible human interactions remains a critical challenge for immersive VR/AR systems and humanoid robotics. While existing methods demonstrate progress in kinematic motion generation, they often fail to address the fundamental tension between real-time responsiveness, physical feasibility, and safety requirements in dynamic human-machine interactions. We introduce Human-X, a novel framework designed to enable immersive and physically plausible human interactions across diverse entities, including human-avatar, human-humanoid, and human-robot systems. Unlike existing approaches that focus on post-hoc alignment or simplified physics, our method jointly predicts actions and reactions in real-time using an auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner, ensuring seamless synchronization and context-aware responses. To enhance physical realism and safety, we integrate an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement learning, which dynamically adapts to interaction partners' movements while avoiding artifacts like foot sliding and penetration. Extensive experiments on the Inter-X and InterHuman datasets demonstrate significant improvements in motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility over state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is validated in real-world applications, including virtual reality interface for human-robot interaction, showcasing its potential for advancing human-robot collaboration.

arXiv:2508.02107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in photorealistic image generation through large-scale models like FLUX and Stable Diffusion v3, the practical deployment of these architectures remains constrained by their inherent intractability to parameter fine-tuning. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have demonstrated efficacy in enabling model customization with minimal parameter overhead, the effective utilization of distributed open-source LoRA modules faces three critical challenges: sparse metadata annotation, the requirement for zero-shot adaptation capabilities, and suboptimal fusion strategies for multi-LoRA fusion strategies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during generation. Our approach achieves significant improvement in image generation perfermance, thereby facilitating scalable and data-efficient enhancement of foundational models. This work establishes a critical bridge between the fragmented landscape of community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment requirements, enabling collaborative model evolution through standardized adapter integration.

Abstract: Lens flare removal remains an information confusion challenge in the underlying image background and the optical flares, due to the complex optical interactions between light sources and camera lens. While recent solutions have shown promise in decoupling the flare corruption from image, they often fail to maintain contextual consistency, leading to incomplete and inconsistent flare removal. To eliminate this limitation, we propose DeflareMamba, which leverages the efficient sequence modeling capabilities of state space models while maintains the ability to capture local-global dependencies. Particularly, we design a hierarchical framework that establishes long-range pixel correlations through varied stride sampling patterns, and utilize local-enhanced state space models that simultaneously preserves local details. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that introduces state space models to the flare removal task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively removes various types of flare artifacts, including scattering and reflective flares, while maintaining the natural appearance of non-flare regions. Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method to improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding.

<title>Beyond RGB and Events: Enhancing Object Detection under Adverse Lighting with Monocular Normal Maps</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02127</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate object detection under adverse lighting conditions is critical for real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Although neuromorphic event cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features, and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by 7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.

<title>VDEGaussian: Video Diffusion Enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Urban Scenes Modeling</title>

Abstract: Dynamic urban scene modeling is a rapidly evolving area with broad applications. While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses, and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view synthesis over baseline approaches.

Abstract: Accurately evaluating the quality of bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) models is essential for photo-realistic rendering. Traditional BRDF-space metrics often employ numerical error measures that fail to capture perceptual differences evident in rendered images. In this paper, we introduce the first perceptually informed neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation that operates directly in BRDF space, eliminating the need for rendering during quality assessment. Our metric is implemented as a compact multi-layer perceptron (MLP), trained on a dataset of measured BRDFs supplemented with synthetically generated data and labelled using a perceptually validated image-space metric. The network takes as input paired samples of reference and approximated BRDFs and predicts their perceptual quality in terms of just-objectionable-difference (JOD) scores. We show that our neural metric achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgments than existing BRDF-space metrics. While its performance as a loss function for BRDF fitting remains limited, the proposed metric offers a perceptually grounded alternative for evaluating BRDF models.

<title>Free-MoRef: Instantly Multiplexing Context Perception Capabilities of Video-MLLMs within Single Inference</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02134</link>

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models~(Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency. Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach \textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\times$ to 8$\times$ longer input frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at https://github.com/wkfdb/Free-MoRef

Abstract: This work investigates the integration of spatially aligned aerial imagery into perception tasks for automated vehicles (AVs). As a central contribution, we present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes dataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local coordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps provided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and nuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an alignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A manual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set of high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future research on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of AID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery serves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion prediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that replaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a 15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory prediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery as a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated vehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are unavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain. AID4AD, along with evaluation code and pretrained models, is publicly released to foster further research in this direction: https://github.com/DriverlessMobility/AID4AD.

<title>TrackletGait: A Robust Framework for Gait Recognition in the Wild</title>

Abstract: Gait recognition aims to identify individuals based on their body shape and walking patterns. Though much progress has been achieved driven by deep learning, gait recognition in real-world surveillance scenarios remains quite challenging to current methods. Conventional approaches, which rely on periodic gait cycles and controlled environments, struggle with the non-periodic and occluded silhouette sequences encountered in the wild. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, TrackletGait, designed to address these challenges in the wild. We propose Random Tracklet Sampling, a generalization of existing sampling methods, which strikes a balance between robustness and representation in capturing diverse walking patterns. Next, we introduce Haar Wavelet-based Downsampling to preserve information during spatial downsampling. Finally, we present a Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, designed to exclude low-quality silhouettes by discarding hard triplet samples. TrackletGait achieves state-of-the-art results, with 77.8 and 80.4 rank-1 accuracy on the Gait3D and GREW datasets, respectively, while using only 10.3M backbone parameters. Extensive experiments are also conducted to further investigate the factors affecting gait recognition in the wild.

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) tasks challenge models to precisely locate sounding objects by integrating visual, auditory, and textual cues. Existing methods often lack genuine semantic understanding, tending to memorize fixed reasoning patterns. Furthermore, jointly training for reasoning and segmentation can compromise pixel-level precision. To address these issues, we introduce AURORA, a novel framework designed to enhance genuine reasoning and language comprehension in reference audio-visual segmentation. We employ a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model through a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation feature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities without sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's genuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training strategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training" stage utilizes self-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by reinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster robustness in challenging scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AURORA achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes effectively to unreferenced segmentation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly enhanced both the visual fidelity and semantic controllability of generated images. However, fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes remains challenging, especially when users require continuous and intensity-specific adjustments. Existing approaches often rely on vague textual prompts, which are inherently ambiguous in expressing both the aesthetic semantics and the desired intensity, or depend on costly human preference data for alignment, limiting their scalability and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose AttriCtrl, a plug-and-play framework for precise and continuous control of aesthetic attributes. Specifically, we quantify abstract aesthetics by leveraging semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models, and employ a lightweight value encoder that maps scalar intensities in $[0,1]$ to learnable embeddings within diffusion-based generation. This design enables intuitive and customizable aesthetic manipulation, with minimal training overhead and seamless integration into existing generation pipelines. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over individual attributes as well as flexible multi-attribute composition. Moreover, it is fully compatible with popular open-source controllable generation frameworks, showcasing strong integration capability and practical utility across diverse generation scenarios.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently convolutional sparse representation (CSR), as a sparse representation technique, has attracted increasing attention in the field of image processing, due to its good characteristic of translate-invariance. The content of CSR usually consists of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and convolutional dictionary learning (CDL), and many studies focus on how to solve the corresponding optimization problems. At present, the most efficient optimization scheme for CSC is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). However, the ADMM-based approach involves a penalty parameter that needs to be carefully selected, and improper parameter selection may result in either no convergence or very slow convergence. In this paper, a novel fast and efficient method using Chambolle-Pock(CP) framework is proposed, which does not require extra manual selection parameters in solving processing, and has faster convergence speed. Furthermore, we propose an anisotropic total variation penalty of the coefficient maps for CSC and apply the CP algorithm to solve it. In addition, we also apply the CP framework to solve the corresponding CDL problem. Experiments show that for noise-free image the proposed CSC algorithms can achieve rival results of the latest ADMM-based approach, while outperforms in removing noise from Gaussian noise pollution image.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although diffusion-based image genenation has been widely explored and applied, background generation tasks in e-commerce scenarios still face significant challenges. The first challenge is to ensure that the generated products are consistent with the given product inputs while maintaining a reasonable spatial arrangement, harmonious shadows, and reflections between foreground products and backgrounds. Existing inpainting methods fail to address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in inpainting tasks remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we introduce DreamEcom-400K, a high-quality e-commerce dataset containing accurate product instance masks, background reference images, text prompts, and aesthetically pleasing product images. Based on this dataset, we propose DreamPainter, a novel framework that not only utilizes text prompts for control but also flexibly incorporates reference image information as an additional control signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, maintaining high product consistency while effectively integrating both text prompt and reference image information.

Abstract: Recognizing objects in images is a fundamental problem in computer vision. Although detecting objects in 2D images is common, many applications require determining their pose in 3D space. Traditional category-level methods rely on RGB-D inputs, which may not always be available, or employ two-stage approaches that use separate models and representations for detection and pose estimation. For the first time, we introduce a unified model that integrates detection and pose estimation into a single framework for RGB images by leveraging neural mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275, improving on the current state-of-the-art by 22.9% averaged across all scale-agnostic metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our unified method exhibits greater robustness compared to single-stage baselines. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/Fischer-Tom/unified-detection-and-pose-estimation.

Abstract: Fine-tuning models via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) demonstrates remarkable performance in subject-driven or style-driven generation tasks. Studies have explored combinations of different LoRAs to jointly generate learned styles and content. However, current methods struggle to balance the original subject and style, and often require additional training. Recently, K-LoRA proposed a training-free LoRA fusion method. But it involves multiple hyperparameters, making it difficult to adapt to all styles and subjects. In this paper, we propose EST-LoRA, a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method. It comprehensively considers three critical factors: \underline{E}nergy of matrix, \underline{S}tyle discrepancy scores and \underline{T}ime steps. Analogous to the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the model adaptively selects between subject LoRA and style LoRA within each attention layer. This integrated selection mechanism ensures balanced contributions from both components during the generation process. Experimental results show that EST-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and achieves faster generation speed compared to other efficient fusion approaches. Our code is publicly available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/EST-LoRA-F318.

Abstract: Illumination in practical scenarios is inherently complex, involving colored light sources, occlusions, and diverse material interactions that produce intricate reflectance and shading effects. However, existing methods often oversimplify this challenge by assuming a single light source or uniform, white-balanced lighting, leaving many of these complexities unaddressed.In this paper, we introduce CL3AN, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset of its kind designed to facilitate the restoration of images captured under multiple Colored Light sources to their Ambient-Normalized counterparts. Through benchmarking, we find that leading approaches often produce artifacts, such as illumination inconsistencies, texture leakage, and color distortion, primarily due to their limited ability to precisely disentangle illumination from reflectance. Motivated by this insight, we achieve such a desired decomposition through a novel learning framework that leverages explicit chromaticity and luminance components guidance, drawing inspiration from the principles of the Retinex model. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks and our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing enhanced robustness under non-homogeneous color lighting and material-specific reflectance variations, all while maintaining a highly competitive computational cost. The benchmark, codes, and models are available at www.github.com/fvasluianu97/RLN2.

Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance, the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency, achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are publicly available at \href{https://rayyoh.github.io/GaussianCross/}{https://rayyoh.github.io/GaussianCross/}.

Abstract: Background : De-identification of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communi-cations in Medicine) files is an essential component of medical image research. Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and/or Personal Health Identifying Information (PHI) need to be hidden or removed due to legal reasons. According to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and privacy rules, also full-face photographic images and any compa-rable images are direct identifiers and are considered protected health information that also need to be de-identified. Objective : The study aimed to implement a method that permit to de-identify the PII and PHI information present in the header and burned on the pixel data of DICOM. Methods : To execute the de-identification, we implemented an algorithm based on the safe harbor method, defined by HIPAA. Our algorithm uses input customizable parameter to classify and then possibly de-identify individual DICOM tags. Results : The most sensible information, like names, history, personal data and institution were successfully recognized. Conclusions : We developed a python algorithm that is able to classify infor-mation present in a DICOM file. The flexibility provided by the use of customi-zable input parameters, which allow the user to customize the entire process de-pending on the case (e.g., the language), makes the entire program very promis-ing for both everyday use and research purposes.

Abstract: The spread of Deepfake videos has caused a trust crisis and impaired social stability. Although numerous approaches have been proposed to address the challenges of Deepfake detection and localization, there is still a lack of systematic research on the weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal forgery localization (WS-MTFL). In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised multimodal temporal forgery localization via multitask learning (WMMT), which addresses the WS-MTFL under the multitask learning paradigm. WMMT achieves multimodal fine-grained Deepfake detection and temporal partial forgery localization using merely video-level annotations. Specifically, visual and audio modality detection are formulated as two binary classification tasks. The multitask learning paradigm is introduced to integrate these tasks into a multimodal task. Furthermore, WMMT utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts structure to adaptively select appropriate features and localization head, achieving excellent flexibility and localization precision in WS-MTFL. A feature enhancement module with temporal property preserving attention mechanism is proposed to identify the intra- and inter-modality feature deviation and construct comprehensive video features. To further explore the temporal information for weakly supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, which aims to enlarge the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reduce the deviation of genuine samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of multitask learning for WS-MTFL, and the WMMT achieves comparable results to fully supervised approaches in several evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Quantizing deep models prior to deployment is a widely adopted technique to speed up inference for various real-time applications, such as autonomous driving. However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance degradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this degradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision counterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To address the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data. Unfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models as they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is unsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory and latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to improve their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model adaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden of existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme to store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory consumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and fostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental results on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based and CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized model adaptation. On the quantized W6A6 ViT-B model, our ZOA is able to achieve a 5.0\% improvement over the state-of-the-art FOA on ImageNet-C dataset. The source code is available at https://github.com/DengZeshuai/ZOA.

<title>Failure Cases Are Better Learned But Boundary Says Sorry: Facilitating Smooth Perception Change for Accuracy-Robustness Trade-Off in Adversarial Training</title>

arXiv:2508.02186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to train robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, AT creates an inherent trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed to the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning of hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact for the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard adversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already learned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous views, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard adversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the trade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception consistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore the information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a smoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its establishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT objective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change smoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the current accuracy-robustness trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18, PreActResNet-18, and WideResNet-34-10 demonstrate the effectiveness of our method beyond four common baselines and 12 state-of-the-art (SOTA) works.

<title>CMIC: Content-Adaptive Mamba for Learned Image Compression</title>

Abstract: Recent Learned image compression (LIC) leverages Mamba-style state-space models (SSMs) for global receptive fields with linear complexity. However, vanilla Mamba is content-agnostic, relying on fixed and predefined selective scans, which restricts its ability to dynamically and fully exploit content dependencies. We introduce Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), a dynamic SSM that addresses two critical limitations. First, it employs content-aware token reorganization, clustering and reordering tokens based on content similarity to prioritize proximity in feature space over Euclidean space. Second, it integrates global priors into SSM via a prompt dictionary, effectively mitigating the strict causality and long-range decay in the token interactions of Mamba. These innovations enable CAM to better capture global dependencies while preserving computational efficiency. Leveraging CAM, our Content-Adaptive Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by -15.91\%, -21.34\%, and -17.58\% BD-rate on Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks, respectively.

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study, we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in clinical applications.

<title>An Event-based Fast Intensity Reconstruction Scheme for UAV Real-time Perception</title>

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages, including a wide dynamic range, high temporal resolution, and immunity to motion blur, making them highly promising for addressing challenging visual conditions. Extracting and utilizing effective information from asynchronous event streams is essential for the onboard implementation of event cameras. In this paper, we propose a streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction scheme, event-based single integration (ESI), to address such implementation challenges. This method guarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to event-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras. The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm. Such a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate, typically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits onboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency improvements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate. As a result, ESI enhances UAV onboard perception significantly under visual adversary surroundings. In-flight tests, ESI demonstrates effective performance for UAV onboard visual tracking under extremely low illumination conditions(2-10lux), whereas other comparative algorithms fail due to insufficient frame rate, poor image quality, or limited real-time performance.

<title>Forecasting When to Forecast: Accelerating Diffusion Models with Confidence-Gated Taylor</title>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion. However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g., attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation, thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible quality drop.

Abstract: Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections. This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task. When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%, 5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. Our code is available at https://github.com/ziyan-xiaoyu/I2CR/.

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which leverages a limited set of labeled images, helps to relieve the heavy annotation burden. While pseudo-labeling strategies yield promising results, there is still room for enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels. Hence, we develop a semi-supervised framework, namely DerProp, equipped with a novel derivative label propagation to rectify imperfect pseudo-labels. Our label propagation method imposes discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors as additional regularization, thereby generating strictly regularized similarity metrics. Doing so effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem that identical similarities correspond to different features, through constraining the solution space. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the rationality of our design, and demonstrate our superiority over other methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/ForawardStar/DerProp/.

<title>Patho-AgenticRAG: Towards Multimodal Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Pathology VLMs via Reinforcement Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong generalization in medical imaging, pathology presents unique challenges due to ultra-high resolution, complex tissue structures, and nuanced clinical semantics. These factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases, limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search, enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based information. Patho-AgenticRAG also supports reasoning, task decomposition, and multi-turn search interactions, improving accuracy in complex diagnostic scenarios. Experiments show that Patho-AgenticRAG significantly outperforms existing multimodal models in complex pathology tasks like multiple-choice diagnosis and visual question answering. Our project is available at the Patho-AgenticRAG repository: https://github.com/Wenchuan-Zhang/Patho-AgenticRAG.

<title>SplatSSC: Decoupled Depth-Guided Gaussian Splatting for Semantic Scene Completion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a challenging yet promising task that aims to infer dense geometric and semantic descriptions of a scene from a single image. While recent object-centric paradigms significantly improve efficiency by leveraging flexible 3D Gaussian primitives, they still rely heavily on a large number of randomly initialized primitives, which inevitably leads to 1) inefficient primitive initialization and 2) outlier primitives that introduce erroneous artifacts. In this paper, we propose SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random initialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image and depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial Gaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing geometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting process. Complemented with a specialized Probability Scale Loss, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ-ScanNet dataset, outperforming prior approaches by over 6.3% in IoU and 4.1% in mIoU, while reducing both latency and memory consumption by more than 9.3%. The code will be released upon acceptance.

<title>Semi-Supervised Dual-Threshold Contrastive Learning for Ultrasound Image Classification and Segmentation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confidence-based pseudo-label selection usually generates overly confident yet incorrect predictions, due to the early misleadingness of model and overfitting inaccurate pseudo-labels in the learning process, which heavily degrades the performance of semi-supervised contrastive learning. Moreover, segmentation and classification tasks are treated independently and the affinity fails to be fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a novel semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for ultrasound image classification and segmentation, named Hermes. This strategy combines the strengths of contrastive learning with semi-supervised learning, where the pseudo-labels assist contrastive learning by providing additional guidance. Specifically, an inter-task attention and saliency module is also developed to facilitate information sharing between the segmentation and classification tasks. Furthermore, an inter-task consistency learning strategy is designed to align tumor features across both tasks, avoiding negative transfer for reducing features discrepancy. To solve the lack of publicly available ultrasound datasets, we have collected the SZ-TUS dataset, a thyroid ultrasound image dataset. Extensive experiments on two public ultrasound datasets and one private dataset demonstrate that Hermes consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across various semi-supervised settings.

Abstract: Local feature matching remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy. However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network (SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers: SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy (0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

<title>Do Edges Matter? Investigating Edge-Enhanced Pre-Training for Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance. However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities. In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw data only.

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous systems, enabling precise localization and dimension estimation. While LiDAR and RGB cameras are widely used, their fixed frame rates create perception gaps in high-speed scenarios. Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution, offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both. Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with object-centric information. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior approaches in dynamic environments, demonstrating the potential of event cameras for robust, continuous-time 3D perception. The code is available at https://github.com/mickeykang16/Ev-Stereo3D.

<title>Towards Real Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Via Confident Meta-Learning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning, which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data. CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2 with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all datasets.

Abstract: Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention. However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools. We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease (IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for early personalized risk stratification.

<title>Is Uncertainty Quantification a Viable Alternative to Learned Deferral?</title>

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift. Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may be a promising choice for AI deferral.

Abstract: Zero-shot compositional action recognition (ZS-CAR) aims to identify unseen verb-object compositions in the videos by exploiting the learned knowledge of verb and object primitives during training. Despite compositional learning's progress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional structure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2) Neglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and impairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like symbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by explicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To this end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates dual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical Primitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the compositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The latter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives, empowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing these constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network architectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic abstraction and existing models. Extensive experiments on the Sth-com dataset demonstrate that our LogicCAR outperforms existing baseline methods, proving the effectiveness of our logic-driven constraints.

Abstract: Volumetric scene reconstruction from a single image is crucial for a broad range of applications like autonomous driving and robotics. Recent volumetric reconstruction methods achieve impressive results, but generally require expensive 3D ground truth or multi-view supervision. We propose to leverage pre-trained 2D diffusion models and depth prediction models to generate synthetic scene geometry from a single image. This can then be used to distill a feed-forward scene reconstruction model. Our experiments on the challenging KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets demonstrate that our method matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines that use multi-view supervision, and offers unique advantages, for example regarding dynamic scenes.

Abstract: We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection, filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering, evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result, Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.

Abstract: Existing methods for rotation estimation between two spherical ($\mathbb{S}^2$) patterns typically rely on spherical cross-correlation maximization between two spherical function. However, these approaches exhibit computational complexities greater than cubic $O(n^3)$ with respect to rotation space discretization and lack extensive evaluation under significant outlier contamination. To this end, we propose a rotation estimation algorithm between two spherical patterns with linear time complexity $O(n)$. Unlike existing spherical-function-based methods, we explicitly represent spherical patterns as discrete 3D point sets on the unit sphere, reformulating rotation estimation as a spherical point-set alignment (i.e., Wahba problem for 3D unit vectors). Given the geometric nature of our formulation, our spherical pattern alignment algorithm naturally aligns with the Wahba problem framework for 3D unit vectors. Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical Pattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a hybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two methods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in correspondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with outliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new dataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset. "Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud Registration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images.

<title>Learning Partially-Decorrelated Common Spaces for Ad-hoc Video Search</title>

Abstract: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple query such as "Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors" can span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces, yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations: feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss. Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces highlight its ability to enhance result diversity.

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems. While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult. Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

Abstract: Generating semantically coherent and visually accurate talking faces requires bridging the gap between linguistic meaning and facial articulation. Although audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a landmark-guided renderer synthesizes photorealistic facial videos with accurate lip synchronization. Extensive evaluations show that Text2Lip outperforms existing approaches in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality robustness, establishing a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking face generation.

Abstract: Effective image inversion in rectified flow models - mapping real images to editable latent representations - is crucial for practical image editing applications; however, achieving optimal balance between reconstruction fidelity and editing flexibility remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we introduce the Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP), a zero-shot framework that leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion process in rectified flow models. Our underlying hypothesis is that incorporating transport-based guidance during the reverse diffusion process can effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability through principled trajectory optimization. The method computes optimal transport paths between image and noise distributions while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, demonstrating superior preservation of fine-grained details compared to existing methods. We evaluate the framework across multiple editing tasks, observing 7.8% to 12.9% improvements in reconstruction loss over RF-Inversion on the LSUN-Bedroom and LSUN-Church datasets, respectively. For semantic face editing, our method achieves an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and a 1.6% enhancement in perceptual quality, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to baseline approaches. Qualitatively, our method produces visually compelling edits with superior semantic consistency and fine-grained detail preservation across diverse editing scenarios.

Abstract: Identifying transportation units (TUs) is essential for improving the efficiency of port logistics. However, progress in this field has been hindered by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets that capture the diversity and dynamics of real-world port environments. To address this gap, we present the TRUDI dataset-a comprehensive collection comprising 35,034 annotated instances across five categories: container, tank container, trailer, ID text, and logo. The images were captured at operational ports using both ground-based and aerial cameras, under a wide variety of lighting and weather conditions. For the identification of TUs-which involves reading the 11-digit alphanumeric ID typically painted on each unit-we introduce TITUS, a dedicated pipeline that operates in three stages: (1) segmenting the TU instances, (2) detecting the location of the ID text, and (3) recognising and validating the extracted ID. Unlike alternative systems, which often require similar scenes, specific camera angles or gate setups, our evaluation demonstrates that TITUS reliably identifies TUs from a range of camera perspectives and in varying lighting and weather conditions. By making the TRUDI dataset publicly available, we provide a robust benchmark that enables the development and comparison of new approaches. This contribution supports digital transformation efforts in multipurpose ports and helps to increase the efficiency of entire logistics chains.

Abstract: Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose \textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation, human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts. Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/JD-GenX/Uni-Layout.

Abstract: Given the limitations of satellite orbits and imaging conditions, multi-modal remote sensing (RS) data is crucial in enabling long-term earth observation. However, maritime surveillance remains challenging due to the complexity of multi-scale targets and the dynamic environments. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a Synchronized Multi-modal Aligned Remote sensing Targets dataset for berthed ships analysis (SMART-Ship), containing spatiotemporal registered images with fine-grained annotation for maritime targets from five modalities: visible-light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), panchromatic, multi-spectral, and near-infrared. Specifically, our dataset consists of 1092 multi-modal image sets, covering 38,838 ships. Each image set is acquired within one week and registered to ensure spatiotemporal consistency. Ship instances in each set are annotated with polygonal location information, fine-grained categories, instance-level identifiers, and change region masks, organized hierarchically to support diverse multi-modal RS tasks. Furthermore, we define standardized benchmarks on five fundamental tasks and comprehensively compare representative methods across the dataset. Thorough experiment evaluations validate that the proposed SMART-Ship dataset could support various multi-modal RS interpretation tasks and reveal the promising directions for further exploration.

Abstract: We propose Cut-Once-and-LEaRn (COLER), a simple approach for unsupervised instance segmentation and object detection. COLER first uses our developed CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut only once and does not rely on any clustering methods, but it can generate multiple object masks in an image. We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models, but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.We believe our method can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.

<title>Hydra: Accurate Multi-Modal Leaf Wetness Sensing with mm-Wave and Camera Fusion</title>

Abstract: Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images. Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves an accuracy rate of around 90%.

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables. Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables. After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Time_Series_Analysis.

<title>Modality Bias in LVLMs: Analyzing and Mitigating Object Hallucination via Attention Lens</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02419</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs, generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens, balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions. Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting its generalizability and efficacy.

Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images, exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational resource requirements.
  The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods. Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall, and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on segmentation.

Abstract: Estimating spoken content from silent videos is crucial for applications in Assistive Technology (AT) and Augmented Reality (AR). However, accurately mapping lip movement sequences in videos to words poses significant challenges due to variability across sequences and the uneven distribution of information within each sequence. To tackle this, we introduce InfoSyncNet, a non-uniform sequence modeling network enhanced by tailored data augmentation techniques. Central to InfoSyncNet is a non-uniform quantization module positioned between the encoder and decoder, enabling dynamic adjustment to the network's focus and effectively handling the natural inconsistencies in visual speech data. Additionally, multiple training strategies are incorporated to enhance the model's capability to handle variations in lighting and the speaker's orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the LRW and LRW1000 datasets confirm the superiority of InfoSyncNet, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracies of 92.0% and 60.7% Top-1 ACC. The code is available for download (see comments).

<title>SAMPO: Visual Preference Optimization for Intent-Aware Segmentation with Vision Foundation Models</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO (Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning. Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9 percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted preference learning.

<title>Multi-class Image Anomaly Detection for Practical Applications: Requirements and Robust Solutions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in image anomaly detection have extended unsupervised learning-based models from single-class settings to multi-class frameworks, aiming to improve efficiency in training time and model storage. When a single model is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to class-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly, previous studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap. However, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively understudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined in multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether class-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In this study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image anomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on whether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then re-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy all defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class labels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision criteria for anomaly detection. We empirically validate the applicability and robustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios, determined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and evaluation phases. The experimental results demonstrate that HierCore consistently meets all requirements and maintains strong, stable performance across all settings, highlighting its practical potential for real-world multi-class anomaly detection tasks.

Abstract: The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$) is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision, we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments. (2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic captioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP similarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through explicit decomposition and semantic prompting.

<title>Low-Frequency First: Eliminating Floating Artifacts in 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful and computationally efficient representation for 3D reconstruction. Despite its strengths, 3DGS often produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS), which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion, effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of 1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks. Our implementation will be released on GitHub.

<title>Rethinking Transparent Object Grasping: Depth Completion with Monocular Depth Estimation and Instance Mask</title>

Abstract: Due to the optical properties, transparent objects often lead depth cameras to generate incomplete or invalid depth data, which in turn reduces the accuracy and reliability of robotic grasping. Existing approaches typically input the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth, expecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values. However, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to highly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data. To address this, we propose ReMake, a novel depth completion framework guided by an instance mask and monocular depth estimation. By explicitly distinguishing transparent regions from non-transparent ones, the mask enables the model to concentrate on learning accurate depth estimation in these areas from RGB-D input during training. This targeted supervision reduces reliance on implicit reasoning and improves generalization to real-world scenarios. Additionally, monocular depth estimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its surroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches on both benchmark datasets and real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization capability.

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) on short-form video platforms has made video engagement prediction increasingly important for optimizing recommendation systems and guiding content creation. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as semantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background. Prior studies have leveraged various types of features from different modalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc., but often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality interactions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two representative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language modalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities. Specifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based metadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames and text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines, showcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction. Notably, VideoLLaMA2 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the importance of audio features in engagement prediction. By ensembling two types of models, our method achieves first place in the ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC Challenge on short-form video engagement prediction.

<title>Understanding the Risks of Asphalt Art on the Reliability of Surveillance Perception Systems</title>

Abstract: Artistic crosswalks featuring asphalt art, introduced by different organizations in recent years, aim to enhance the visibility and safety of pedestrians. However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns, particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections. These findings highlight a potential vulnerability in urban vision-based pedestrian surveillance systems and underscore the importance of accounting for environmental visual variations when designing robust pedestrian perception models.

<title>Precision-Aware Video Compression for Reducing Bandwidth Requirements in Video Communication for Vehicle Detection-Based Applications</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02533</link>

Abstract: Computer vision has become a popular tool in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), enabling various applications through roadside traffic cameras that capture video and transmit it in real time to computing devices within the same network. The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the available bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can lead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS applications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be used to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality. This degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely on real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is influenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions, suggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response to these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera captures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits them to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for safety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The system dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather and lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing bandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection accuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to 8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability. Moreover, in locations with severely limited bandwidth, PAVC reduces bandwidth requirements by up to 72x while preserving vehicle detection performance.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g., global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent, enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However, current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97% improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to the previous SOTA method RAG-T2M.

<title>Evaluating Variance in Visual Question Answering Benchmarks</title>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for visual question answering (VQA), enabling reasoning and contextual understanding across visual and textual modalities. Despite their advancements, the evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks often relies on point estimates, overlooking the significant variance in performance caused by factors such as stochastic model outputs, training seed sensitivity, and hyperparameter configurations. This paper critically examines these issues by analyzing variance across 14 widely used VQA benchmarks, covering diverse tasks such as visual reasoning, text understanding, and commonsense reasoning. We systematically study the impact of training seed, framework non-determinism, model scale, and extended instruction finetuning on performance variability. Additionally, we explore Cloze-style evaluation as an alternate assessment strategy, studying its effectiveness in reducing stochasticity and improving reliability across benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of current evaluation practices and advocate for variance-aware methodologies to foster more robust and reliable development of MLLMs.

Abstract: Modeling complex rigid motion across large spatiotemporal spans remains an unresolved challenge in dynamic reconstruction. Existing paradigms are mainly confined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration for physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing Projectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages: 1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic scene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery: restoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce an acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose estimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively schedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman fusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to mitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic methods.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness. Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key, counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore, scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical reasoning.

<title>Raw Data Matters: Enhancing Prompt Tuning by Internal Augmentation on Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02671</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.02671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For CLIP-based prompt tuning, introducing more data as additional knowledge for enhancing fine-tuning process is proved to be an effective approach. Existing data amplification strategies for prompt tuning typically rely on external knowledge (e.g., large language models or pre-structured knowledge bases), resulting in higher costs for data collection and processing, while generally ignoring further utilization of features in image modality. To address this, we propose Augmentation-driven Prompt Tuning (AugPT), a self-contained distillation-based prompt tuning approach using only internal augmentation on raw dataset to better exploit known features. Specifically, AugPT employs self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images in the training set, and introduces a novel gating mechanism based on consensus test, reusing the pre-trained prompt tuning backbone model to spontaneously filter noisy samples, further enhancing the quality of augmented views. Extensive experiments validate that AugPT simultaneously enhances model performance and generalization capability without using appended external knowledge. The code of AugPT is available at: https://github.com/JREion/AugPT .

Abstract: Accurately estimating hand pose and hand-object contact events is essential for robot data-collection, immersive virtual environments, and biomechanical analysis, yet remains challenging due to visual occlusion, subtle contact cues, limitations in vision-only sensing, and the lack of accessible and flexible tactile sensing. We therefore introduce VibeMesh, a novel wearable system that fuses vision with active acoustic sensing for dense, per-vertex hand contact and pose estimation. VibeMesh integrates a bone-conduction speaker and sparse piezoelectric microphones, distributed on a human hand, emitting structured acoustic signals and capturing their propagation to infer changes induced by contact. To interpret these cross-modal signals, we propose a graph-based attention network that processes synchronized audio spectra and RGB-D-derived hand meshes to predict contact with high spatial resolution. We contribute: (i) a lightweight, non-intrusive visuo-acoustic sensing platform; (ii) a cross-modal graph network for joint pose and contact inference; (iii) a dataset of synchronized RGB-D, acoustic, and ground-truth contact annotations across diverse manipulation scenarios; and (iv) empirical results showing that VibeMesh outperforms vision-only baselines in accuracy and robustness, particularly in occluded or static-contact settings.

Abstract: Fairness remains a critical concern in healthcare, where unequal access to services and treatment outcomes can adversely affect patient health. While Federated Learning (FL) presents a collaborative and privacy-preserving approach to model training, ensuring fairness is challenging due to heterogeneous data across institutions, and current research primarily addresses non-medical applications. To fill this gap, we establish the first experimental benchmark for fairness in medical FL, evaluating six representative FL methods across diverse demographic attributes and imaging modalities. We introduce FairFedMed, the first medical FL dataset specifically designed to study group fairness (i.e., demographics). It comprises two parts: FairFedMed-Oph, featuring 2D fundus and 3D OCT ophthalmology samples with six demographic attributes; and FairFedMed-Chest, which simulates real cross-institutional FL using subsets of CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR. Together, they support both simulated and real-world FL across diverse medical modalities and demographic groups. Existing FL models often underperform on medical images and overlook fairness across demographic groups. To address this, we propose FairLoRA, a fairness-aware FL framework based on SVD-based low-rank approximation. It customizes singular value matrices per demographic group while sharing singular vectors, ensuring both fairness and efficiency. Experimental results on the FairFedMed dataset demonstrate that FairLoRA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical image classification but also significantly improves fairness across diverse populations. Our code and dataset can be accessible via link: https://wang.hms.harvard.edu/fairfedmed/.

<title>FRAM: Frobenius-Regularized Assignment Matching with Mixed-Precision Computing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph matching, typically formulated as a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP), seeks to establish node correspondences between two graphs. To address the NP-hardness of QAP, some existing methods adopt projection-based relaxations that embed the problem into the convex hull of the discrete domain. However, these relaxations inevitably enlarge the feasible set, introducing two sources of error: numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment between the relaxed and original domains. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel relaxation framework by reformulating the projection step as a Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, where a tunable regularization term mitigates feasible region inflation. This formulation enables normalization-based operations to preserve numerical scale invariance without compromising accuracy. To efficiently solve FRA, we propose the Scaling Doubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm. Building on its favorable computational properties, we develop a theoretically grounded mixed-precision architecture to achieve substantial acceleration. Comprehensive CPU-based benchmarks demonstrate that FRAM consistently outperforms all baseline methods under identical precision settings. When combined with a GPU-based mixed-precision architecture, FRAM achieves up to 370X speedup over its CPU-FP64 counterpart, with negligible loss in solution accuracy.

Abstract: The global demand for medicinal plants, such as Damask roses, has surged with population growth, yet labor-intensive harvesting remains a bottleneck for scalability. To address this, we propose a novel 3D perception pipeline tailored for flower-harvesting robots, focusing on sparse 3D localization of rose centers. Our two-stage algorithm first performs 2D point-based detection on stereo images, followed by depth estimation using a lightweight deep neural network. To overcome the challenge of scarce real-world labeled data, we introduce a photorealistic synthetic dataset generated via Blender, simulating a dynamic rose farm environment with precise 3D annotations. This approach minimizes manual labeling costs while enabling robust model training. We evaluate two depth estimation paradigms: a traditional triangulation-based method and our proposed deep learning framework. Results demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving an F1 score of 95.6% (synthetic) and 74.4% (real) in 2D detection, with a depth estimation error of 3% at a 2-meter range on synthetic data. The pipeline is optimized for computational efficiency, ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained robotic systems. By bridging the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, this work advances agricultural automation for specialty crops, offering a scalable solution for precision harvesting.

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) must simultaneously perform multiple tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation, trajectory prediction, motion prediction, and behaviour prediction, to ensure safe and reliable navigation in complex environments. Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication enables cooperative driving among CAVs, thereby mitigating the limitations of individual sensors, reducing occlusions, and improving perception over long distances. Traditionally, these tasks are addressed using distinct models, which leads to high deployment costs, increased computational overhead, and challenges in achieving real-time performance. Multi-task learning (MTL) has recently emerged as a promising solution that enables the joint learning of multiple tasks within a single unified model. This offers improved efficiency and resource utilization. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive review focused on MTL in the context of CAVs. We begin with an overview of CAVs and MTL to provide foundational background. We then explore the application of MTL across key functional modules, including perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent collaboration. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing methods, identify key research gaps, and provide directions for future research aimed at advancing MTL methodologies for CAV systems.

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis have enabled efficient, photorealistic rendering, but the data collection process remains largely manual, making it time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address the challenges, this study introduces Hierarchical Next-Best-View Exploration for Systematic Intelligent Autonomous Data Collection (Hestia), which leverages reinforcement learning to learn a generalizable policy for 5-DoF next-best viewpoint prediction. Unlike prior approaches, Hestia systematically defines the next-best-view task by proposing core components such as dataset choice, observation design, action space, reward calculation, and learning schemes, forming a foundation for the planner. Hestia goes beyond prior next-best-view approaches and traditional capture systems through integration and validation in a real-world setup, where a drone serves as a mobile sensor for active scene exploration. Experimental results show that Hestia performs robustly across three datasets and translated object settings in the NVIDIA IsaacLab environment, and proves feasible for real-world deployment.

Abstract: This retrospective study evaluated five VLMs (Qwen2.5, Phi-4, Gemma3, Llama3.2, and Mistral3.1) using the MedFMC dataset. This dataset includes 22,349 images from 7,461 patients encompassing chest radiography (19 disease multi-label classifications), colon pathology (tumor detection), endoscopy (colorectal lesion identification), neonatal jaundice assessment (skin color-based treatment necessity), and retinal fundoscopy (5-point diabetic retinopathy grading). Diagnostic accuracy was compared in three experimental settings: visual input only, multimodal input, and chain-of-thought reasoning. Model accuracy was assessed against ground truth labels, with statistical comparisons using bootstrapped confidence intervals (p<.05). Qwen2.5 achieved the highest accuracy for chest radiographs (90.4%) and endoscopy images (84.2%), significantly outperforming the other models (p<.001). In colon pathology, Qwen2.5 (69.0%) and Phi-4 (69.6%) performed comparably (p=.41), both significantly exceeding other VLMs (p<.001). Similarly, for neonatal jaundice assessment, Qwen2.5 (58.3%) and Phi-4 (58.1%) showed comparable leading accuracies (p=.93) significantly exceeding their counterparts (p<.001). All models struggled with retinal fundoscopy; Qwen2.5 and Gemma3 achieved the highest, albeit modest, accuracies at 18.6% (comparable, p=.99), significantly better than other tested models (p<.001). Unexpectedly, multimodal input reduced accuracy for some models and modalities, and chain-of-thought reasoning prompts also failed to improve accuracy. The open-source VLMs demonstrated promising diagnostic capabilities, particularly in chest radiograph interpretation. However, performance in complex domains such as retinal fundoscopy was limited, underscoring the need for further development and domain-specific adaptation before widespread clinical application.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is critical for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose a semi-supervised, two-stage framework that extends the ReCoSeg approach to the larger and more heterogeneous BraTS 2021 dataset, while eliminating the need for ground-truth masks for the segmentation objective. In the first stage, a residual-guided denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) performs cross-modal synthesis by reconstructing the T1ce modality from FLAIR, T1, and T2 scans. The residual maps, capturing differences between predicted and actual T1ce images, serve as spatial priors to enhance downstream segmentation. In the second stage, a lightweight U-Net takes as input the concatenation of residual maps, computed as the difference between real T1ce and synthesized T1ce, with T1, T2, and FLAIR modalities to improve whole tumor segmentation. To address the increased scale and variability of BraTS 2021, we apply slice-level filtering to exclude non-informative samples and optimize thresholding strategies to balance precision and recall. Our method achieves a Dice score of $93.02\%$ and an IoU of $86.7\%$ for whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2021 dataset, outperforming the ReCoSeg baseline on BraTS 2020 (Dice: $91.7\%$, IoU: $85.3\%$), and demonstrating improved accuracy and scalability for real-world, multi-center MRI datasets.

Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) enhances situational awareness of connected and autonomous vehicles by exchanging and combining messages from multiple agents. While prior work has explored adversarial integrity attacks that degrade perceptual accuracy, little is known about CP's robustness against attacks on timeliness (or availability), a safety-critical requirement for autonomous driving. In this paper, we present CP-FREEZER, the first latency attack that maximizes the computation delay of CP algorithms by injecting adversarial perturbation via V2V messages. Our attack resolves several unique challenges, including the non-differentiability of point cloud preprocessing, asynchronous knowledge of the victim's input due to transmission delays, and uses a novel loss function that effectively maximizes the execution time of the CP pipeline. Extensive experiments show that CP-FREEZER increases end-to-end CP latency by over $90\times$, pushing per-frame processing time beyond 3 seconds with a 100% success rate on our real-world vehicle testbed. Our findings reveal a critical threat to the availability of CP systems, highlighting the urgent need for robust defenses.

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient execution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT) tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being lighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we introduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively balances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of medical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer bottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with downsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced computational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering diverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen datasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and generalization solution for mobile medical image analysis. Code is available at https://github.com/FengheTan9/Mobile-U-ViT.

<title>Point-wise Diffusion Models for Physical Systems with Shape Variations: Application to Spatio-temporal and Large-scale system</title>

Abstract: This study introduces a novel point-wise diffusion model that processes spatio-temporal points independently to efficiently predict complex physical systems with shape variations. This methodological contribution lies in applying forward and backward diffusion processes at individual spatio-temporal points, coupled with a point-wise diffusion transformer architecture for denoising. Unlike conventional image-based diffusion models that operate on structured data representations, this framework enables direct processing of any data formats including meshes and point clouds while preserving geometric fidelity. We validate our approach across three distinct physical domains with complex geometric configurations: 2D spatio-temporal systems including cylinder fluid flow and OLED drop impact test, and 3D large-scale system for road-car external aerodynamics. To justify the necessity of our point-wise approach for real-time prediction applications, we employ denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) for efficient deterministic sampling, requiring only 5-10 steps compared to traditional 1000-step and providing computational speedup of 100 to 200 times during inference without compromising accuracy. In addition, our proposed model achieves superior performance compared to image-based diffusion model: reducing training time by 94.4% and requiring 89.0% fewer parameters while achieving over 28% improvement in prediction accuracy. Comprehensive comparisons against data-flexible surrogate models including DeepONet and Meshgraphnet demonstrate consistent superiority of our approach across all three physical systems. To further refine the proposed model, we investigate two key aspects: 1) comparison of final physical states prediction or incremental change prediction, and 2) computational efficiency evaluation across varying subsampling ratios (10%-100%).

Abstract: We present MeshLLM, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to understand and generate text-serialized 3D meshes. Our approach addresses key limitations in existing methods, including the limited dataset scale when catering to LLMs' token length and the loss of 3D structural information during mesh serialization. We introduce a Primitive-Mesh decomposition strategy, which divides 3D meshes into structurally meaningful subunits. This enables the creation of a large-scale dataset with 1500k+ samples, almost 50 times larger than previous methods, which aligns better with the LLM scaling law principles. Furthermore, we propose inferring face connectivity from vertices and local mesh assembly training strategies, significantly enhancing the LLMs' ability to capture mesh topology and spatial structures. Experiments show that MeshLLM outperforms the state-of-the-art LLaMA-Mesh in both mesh generation quality and shape understanding, highlighting its great potential in processing text-serialized 3D meshes.

<title>CoCoLIT: ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation for MRI to Amyloid PET Synthesis</title>

Abstract: Synthesizing amyloid PET scans from the more widely available and accessible structural MRI modality offers a promising, cost-effective approach for large-scale Alzheimer's Disease (AD) screening. This is motivated by evidence that, while MRI does not directly detect amyloid pathology, it may nonetheless encode information correlated with amyloid deposition that can be uncovered through advanced modeling. However, the high dimensionality and structural complexity of 3D neuroimaging data pose significant challenges for existing MRI-to-PET translation methods. Modeling the cross-modality relationship in a lower-dimensional latent space can simplify the learning task and enable more effective translation. As such, we present CoCoLIT (ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation), a diffusion-based latent generative framework that incorporates three main innovations: (1) a novel Weighted Image Space Loss (WISL) that improves latent representation learning and synthesis quality; (2) a theoretical and empirical analysis of Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), an existing technique used in similar generative models to enhance inference consistency; and (3) the introduction of ControlNet-based conditioning for MRI-to-PET translation. We evaluate CoCoLIT's performance on publicly available datasets and find that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both image-based and amyloid-related metrics. Notably, in amyloid-positivity classification, CoCoLIT outperforms the second-best method with improvements of +10.5% on the internal dataset and +23.7% on the external dataset. The code and models of our approach are available at https://github.com/brAIn-science/CoCoLIT.

<title>SWAN: Synergistic Wavelet-Attention Network for Infrared Small Target Detection</title>

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is thus critical in both civilian and military applications. This study addresses the challenge of precisely IRSTD in complex backgrounds. Recent methods focus fundamental reliance on conventional convolution operations, which primarily capture local spatial patterns and struggle to distinguish the unique frequency-domain characteristics of small targets from intricate background clutter. To overcome these limitations, we proposed the Synergistic Wavelet-Attention Network (SWAN), a novel framework designed to perceive targets from both spatial and frequency domains. SWAN leverages a Haar Wavelet Convolution (HWConv) for a deep, cross-domain fusion of the frequency energy and spatial details of small target. Furthermore, a Shifted Spatial Attention (SSA) mechanism efficiently models long-range spatial dependencies with linear computational complexity, enhancing contextual awareness. Finally, a Residual Dual-Channel Attention (RDCA) module adaptively calibrates channel-wise feature responses to suppress background interference while amplifying target-pertinent signals. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SWAN surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, showing significant improvements in detection accuracy and robustness, particularly in complex challenging scenarios.

Abstract: The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has greatly improved the interpretation of medical images. However, conventional CNNs typically demand extensive computational resources and large training datasets. To address these limitations, this study applied transfer learning to achieve strong classification performance using fewer training samples. Specifically, the study compared EfficientNetV2 with its predecessor, EfficientNet, and with ResNet50 in classifying brain tumors into three types: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors. Results showed that EfficientNetV2 delivered superior performance compared to the other models. However, this improvement came at the cost of increased training time, likely due to the model's greater complexity.

<title>Predicting EGFR Mutation in LUAD from Histopathological Whole-Slide Images Using Pretrained Foundation Model and Transfer Learning: An Indian Cohort Study</title>

Abstract: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). LUAD with mutation in the EGFR gene accounts for approximately 46% of LUAD cases. Patients carrying EGFR mutations can be treated with specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, predicting EGFR mutation status can help in clinical decision making. H&amp;E-stained whole slide imaging (WSI) is a routinely performed screening procedure for cancer staging and subtyping, especially affecting the Southeast Asian populations with significantly higher incidence of the mutation when compared to Caucasians (39-64% vs 7-22%). Recent progress in AI models has shown promising results in cancer detection and classification. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework built on vision transformers (ViT) based pathology foundation model and attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) architecture to predict EGFR mutation status from H&amp;E WSI. The developed pipeline was trained using data from an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and evaluated across two independent datasets: Internal test (30 WSI from Indian cohort) set, and an external test set from TCGA (86 WSI). The model shows consistent performance across both datasets, with AUCs of 0.933 (+/-0.010), and 0.965 (+/-0.015) for the internal and external test sets respectively. This proposed framework can be efficiently trained on small datasets, achieving superior performance as compared to several prior studies irrespective of training domain. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting EGFR mutation status using routine pathology slides, particularly in resource-limited settings using foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning.

Abstract: The reconstruction of multi-layer 3D garments typically requires expensive multi-view capture setups and specialized 3D editing efforts. To support the creation of life-like clothed human avatars, we introduce ReMu for reconstructing multi-layer clothed humans in a new setup, Image Layers, which captures a subject wearing different layers of clothing with a single RGB camera. To reconstruct physically plausible multi-layer 3D garments, a unified 3D representation is necessary to model these garments in a layered manner. Thus, we first reconstruct and align each garment layer in a shared coordinate system defined by the canonical body pose. Afterwards, we introduce a collision-aware optimization process to address interpenetration and further refine the garment boundaries leveraging implicit neural fields. It is worth noting that our method is template-free and category-agnostic, which enables the reconstruction of 3D garments in diverse clothing styles. Through our experiments, we show that our method reconstructs nearly penetration-free 3D clothed humans and achieves competitive performance compared to category-specific methods.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables simultaneous measurement of gene expression and tissue morphology, offering unprecedented insights into cellular organization and disease mechanisms. However, the field lacks comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However, downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and benchmarking tools for the community

Abstract: Accurate estimation of biological brain age from three dimensional (3D) T$_1$-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical imaging biomarker for identifying accelerated aging associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Effective brain age prediction necessitates training 3D models to leverage comprehensive insights from volumetric MRI scans, thereby fully capturing spatial anatomical context. However, optimizing deep 3D models remains challenging due to problems such as vanishing gradients. Furthermore, brain structural patterns differ significantly between sexes, which impacts aging trajectories and vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases, thereby making sex classification crucial for enhancing the accuracy and generalizability of predictive models. To address these challenges, we propose a Deeply Supervised Multitask Autoencoder (DSMT-AE) framework for brain age estimation. DSMT-AE employs deep supervision, which involves applying supervisory signals at intermediate layers during training, to stabilize model optimization, and multitask learning to enhance feature representation. Specifically, our framework simultaneously optimizes brain age prediction alongside auxiliary tasks of sex classification and image reconstruction, thus effectively capturing anatomical and demographic variability to improve prediction accuracy. We extensively evaluate DSMT-AE on the Open Brain Health Benchmark (OpenBHB) dataset, the largest multisite neuroimaging cohort combining ten publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that DSMT-AE achieves state-of-the-art performance and robustness across age and sex subgroups. Additionally, our ablation study confirms that each proposed component substantially contributes to the improved predictive accuracy and robustness of the overall architecture.

Abstract: The parcellation of Cranial Nerves (CNs) serves as a crucial quantitative methodology for evaluating the morphological characteristics and anatomical pathways of specific CNs. Multi-modal CNs parcellation networks have achieved promising segmentation performance, which combine structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and diffusion MRI. However, insufficient exploration of diffusion MRI information has led to low performance of existing multi-modal fusion. In this work, we propose a tractography-guided Dual-label Collaborative Learning Network (DCLNet) for multi-modal CNs parcellation. The key contribution of our DCLNet is the introduction of coarse labels of CNs obtained from fiber tractography through CN atlas, and collaborative learning with precise labels annotated by experts. Meanwhile, we introduce a Modality-adaptive Encoder Module (MEM) to achieve soft information swapping between structural MRI and diffusion MRI. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate performance improvements compared to single-label network. This systematic validation underscores the effectiveness of dual-label strategies in addressing inherent ambiguities in CNs parcellation tasks.

Abstract: In-betweening human motion generation aims to synthesize intermediate motions that transition between user-specified keyframes. In addition to maintaining smooth transitions, a crucial requirement of this task is to generate diverse motion sequences. It is still challenging to maintain diversity, particularly when it is necessary for the motions within a generated batch sampling to differ meaningfully from one another due to complex motion dynamics. In this paper, we propose a novel method, termed the Multi-Criteria Guidance with In-Betweening Motion Model (MCG-IMM), for in-betweening human motion generation. A key strength of MCG-IMM lies in its plug-and-play nature: it enhances the diversity of motions generated by pretrained models without introducing additional parameters This is achieved by providing a sampling process of pretrained generative models with multi-criteria guidance. Specifically, MCG-IMM reformulates the sampling process of pretrained generative model as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and introduces an optimization process to explore motion sequences that satisfy multiple criteria, e.g., diversity and smoothness. Moreover, our proposed plug-and-play multi-criteria guidance is compatible with different families of generative models, including denoised diffusion probabilistic models, variational autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. Experiments on four popular human motion datasets demonstrate that MCG-IMM consistently state-of-the-art methods in in-betweening motion generation task.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU), i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences. This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

Abstract: The ability to predict the attention of expert pathologists could lead to decision support systems for better pathology training. We developed methods to predict the spatio-temporal (where and when) movements of pathologists' attention as they grade whole slide images (WSIs) of prostate cancer. We characterize a pathologist's attention trajectory by their x, y, and m (magnification) movements of a viewport as they navigate WSIs using a digital microscope. This information was obtained from 43 pathologists across 123 WSIs, and we consider the task of predicting the pathologist attention scanpaths constructed from the viewport centers. We introduce a fixation extraction algorithm that simplifies an attention trajectory by extracting fixations in the pathologist's viewing while preserving semantic information, and we use these pre-processed data to train and test a two-stage model to predict the dynamic (scanpath) allocation of attention during WSI reading via intermediate attention heatmap prediction. In the first stage, a transformer-based sub-network predicts the attention heatmaps (static attention) across different magnifications. In the second stage, we predict the attention scanpath by sequentially modeling the next fixation points in an autoregressive manner using a transformer-based approach, starting at the WSI center and leveraging multi-magnification feature representations from the first stage. Experimental results show that our scanpath prediction model outperforms chance and baseline models. Tools developed from this model could assist pathology trainees in learning to allocate their attention during WSI reading like an expert.

Abstract: Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty, caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction. Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions. Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports, often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical decision support.

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. We present CcGAN-AVAR, an enhanced CcGAN framework that addresses both challenges: (1) leveraging the GAN framework's native one-step generation to overcome CCDMs' sampling bottleneck (achieving 300x-2000x faster inference), while (2) two novel components specifically target data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism that dynamically adjusts vicinity's size, and a multi-task discriminator that constructs two regularization terms (through auxiliary regression and density ratio estimation) to significantly improve generator training. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 192x192 resolution) across eight challenging imbalanced settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

Abstract: Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters, particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening neurological emergency with mortality rates exceeding 30%. Transfer learning from related hematoma types represents a potentially valuable but underexplored approach. Although Unet architectures remain the gold standard for medical image segmentation due to their effectiveness on limited datasets, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) methods for parameter-efficient transfer learning have been rarely applied to convolutional neural networks in medical imaging contexts. We implemented a Unet architecture pre-trained on computed tomography scans from 124 traumatic brain injury patients across multiple institutions, then fine-tuned on 30 aneurysmal SAH patients from the University of Michigan Health System using 3-fold cross-validation. We developed a novel CP-LoRA method based on tensor CP-decomposition and introduced DoRA variants (DoRA-C, convDoRA, CP-DoRA) that decompose weight matrices into magnitude and directional components. We compared these approaches against existing LoRA methods (LoRA-C, convLoRA) and standard fine-tuning strategies across different modules on a multi-view Unet model. LoRA-based methods consistently outperformed standard Unet fine-tuning. Performance varied by hemorrhage volume, with all methods showing improved accuracy for larger volumes. CP-LoRA achieved comparable performance to existing methods while using significantly fewer parameters. Over-parameterization with higher ranks consistently yielded better performance than strictly low-rank adaptations. This study demonstrates that transfer learning between hematoma types is feasible and that LoRA-based methods significantly outperform conventional Unet fine-tuning for aneurysmal SAH segmentation.

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have driven promis ing progress in lossless image compression. However, di rectly adopting existing paradigms for medical images suf fers from an unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
  performance and efficiency. Moreover, existing LLM-based
  compressors often overlook the security of the compres sion process, which is critical in modern medical scenarios.
  To this end, we propose a novel joint lossless compression
  and steganography framework. Inspired by bit plane slicing
  (BPS), we find it feasible to securely embed privacy messages
  into medical images in an invisible manner. Based on this in sight, an adaptive modalities decomposition strategy is first
  devised to partition the entire image into two segments, pro viding global and local modalities for subsequent dual-path
  lossless compression. During this dual-path stage, we inno vatively propose a segmented message steganography algo rithm within the local modality path to ensure the security of
  the compression process. Coupled with the proposed anatom ical priors-based low-rank adaptation (A-LoRA) fine-tuning
  strategy, extensive experimental results demonstrate the su periority of our proposed method in terms of compression ra tios, efficiency, and security. The source code will be made
  publicly available.

Abstract: In Augmented Reality (AR), virtual objects interact with real objects. However, the lack of physicality of virtual objects leads to the absence of natural sonic interactions. When virtual and real objects collide, either no sound or a generic sound is played. Both lead to an incongruent multisensory experience, reducing interaction and object realism. Unlike in Virtual Reality (VR) and games, where predefined scenes and interactions allow for the playback of pre-recorded sound samples, AR requires real-time sound synthesis that dynamically adapts to novel contexts and objects to provide audiovisual congruence during interaction. To enhance real-virtual object interactions in AR, we propose a framework for context-aware sounds using methods from computer vision to recognize and segment the materials of real objects. The material's physical properties and the impact dynamics of the interaction are used to generate material-based sounds in real-time using physical modelling synthesis. In a user study with 24 participants, we compared our congruent material-based sounds to a generic sound effect, mirroring the current standard of non-context-aware sounds in AR applications. The results showed that material-based sounds led to significantly more realistic sonic interactions. Material-based sounds also enabled participants to distinguish visually similar materials with significantly greater accuracy and confidence. These findings show that context-aware, material-based sonic interactions in AR foster a stronger sense of realism and enhance our perception of real-world surroundings.

Abstract: Accurate breast tumor segmentation in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is important for downstream tasks such as pathological complete response (pCR) assessment. In this work, we address both segmentation and pCR classification using the large-scale MAMA-MIA DCE-MRI dataset. We employ a large-kernel MedNeXt architecture with a two-stage training strategy that expands the receptive field from 3x3x3 to 5x5x5 kernels using the UpKern algorithm. This approach allows stable transfer of learned features to larger kernels, improving segmentation performance on the unseen validation set. An ensemble of large-kernel models achieved a Dice score of 0.67 and a normalized Hausdorff Distance (NormHD) of 0.24. For pCR classification, we trained a self-normalizing network (SNN) on radiomic features extracted from the predicted segmentations and first post-contrast DCE-MRI, reaching an average balanced accuracy of 57\%, and up to 75\% in some subgroups. Our findings highlight the benefits of combining larger receptive fields and radiomics-driven classification while motivating future work on advanced ensembling and the integration of clinical variables to further improve performance and generalization.

Abstract: For machines to effectively assist humans in challenging visual search tasks, they must differentiate whether a human is simply glancing into a scene (navigational intent) or searching for a target object (informational intent). Previous research proposed combining electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-tracking measurements to recognize such search intents implicitly, i.e., without explicit user input. However, the applicability of these approaches to real-world scenarios suffers from two key limitations. First, previous work used fixed search times in the informational intent condition -- a stark contrast to visual search, which naturally terminates when the target is found. Second, methods incorporating EEG measurements addressed prediction scenarios that require ground truth training data from the target user, which is impractical in many use cases. We address these limitations by making the first publicly available EEG and eye-tracking dataset for navigational vs. informational intent recognition, where the user determines search times. We present the first method for cross-user prediction of search intents from EEG and eye-tracking recordings and reach 84.5% accuracy in leave-one-user-out evaluations -- comparable to within-user prediction accuracy (85.5%) but offering much greater flexibility

Abstract: This work presents the results of a methodological transfer from remote sensing to healthcare, adapting AMBER -- a transformer-based model originally designed for multiband images, such as hyperspectral data -- to the task of 3D medical datacube segmentation. In this study, we use the AMBER architecture with Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (AFNO) in place of the multi-head self-attention mechanism. While existing models rely on various forms of attention to capture global context, AMBER-AFNO achieves this through frequency-domain mixing, enabling a drastic reduction in model complexity. This design reduces the number of trainable parameters by over 80% compared to UNETR++, while maintaining a FLOPs count comparable to other state-of-the-art architectures. Model performance is evaluated on two benchmark 3D medical datasets -- ACDC and Synapse -- using standard metrics such as Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance (HD), demonstrating that AMBER-AFNO achieves competitive or superior accuracy with significant gains in training efficiency, inference speed, and memory usage.

<title>ROVER: Recursive Reasoning Over Videos with Vision-Language Models for Embodied Tasks</title>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across diverse image understanding tasks, but still struggle in settings that require reasoning over extended sequences of camera frames from a video. This limits their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach, on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation, frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over baselines.

This comprehensive review examines the technical foundations enabling this paradigm shift across four critical domains: (1) platform architectures optimized for indoor navigation, where weight constraints drive innovations in heterogeneous computing, collision-tolerant design, and hierarchical control systems; (2) advanced sensing modalities that extend perception beyond human vision, including hyperspectral imaging for material identification, polarimetric sensing for surface characterization, and computational imaging with metaphotonics enabling radical miniaturization; (3) intelligent autonomy through active reconstruction algorithms, where drones equipped with 3D Gaussian Splatting make strategic decisions about viewpoint selection to maximize information gain within battery constraints; and (4) integration pathways with existing property workflows, including Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems and industry standards like Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) 3.6.

Abstract: Audio-visual temporal deepfake localization under the content-driven partial manipulation remains a highly challenging task. In this scenario, the deepfake regions are usually only spanning a few frames, with the majority of the rest remaining identical to the original. To tackle this, we propose a Hierarchical Boundary Modeling Network (HBMNet), which includes three modules: an Audio-Visual Feature Encoder that extracts discriminative frame-level representations, a Coarse Proposal Generator that predicts candidate boundary regions, and a Fine-grained Probabilities Generator that refines these proposals using bidirectional boundary-content probabilities. From the modality perspective, we enhance audio-visual learning through dedicated encoding and fusion, reinforced by frame-level supervision to boost discriminability. From the temporal perspective, HBMNet integrates multi-scale cues and bidirectional boundary-content relationships. Experiments show that encoding and fusion primarily improve precision, while frame-level supervision boosts recall. Each module (audio-visual fusion, temporal scales, bi-directionality) contributes complementary benefits, collectively enhancing localization performance. HBMNet outperforms BA-TFD and UMMAFormer and shows improved potential scalability with more training data.

Abstract: Reliable and interpretable tumor classification from clinical imaging remains a core challenge due to heterogeneous modality quality, limited annotations, and the lack of structured anatomical guidance. We introduce REACT-KD, a Region-Aware Cross-modal Topological Knowledge Distillation framework that transfers rich supervision from high-fidelity multi-modal sources into a lightweight CT-based student model. The framework uses a dual teacher design: one branch captures structure-function relationships using dual-tracer PET/CT, and the other models dose-aware features through synthetically degraded low-dose CT data. These branches jointly guide the student model through two complementary objectives. The first focuses on semantic alignment via logits distillation, while the second models anatomical topology using region graph distillation. A shared CBAM-3D module is employed to maintain consistent attention across modalities. To improve reliability for deployment, REACT-KD introduces modality dropout during training, allowing inference under partial or noisy inputs. The staging task for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is conducted as a case study. REACT-KD achieves an average AUC of 93.4% on an internal PET/CT cohort and maintains 76.6% to 81.5% AUC across varying dose levels in external CT testing. Decision curve analysis shows that REACT-KD consistently provides the highest clinical benefit across decision thresholds, supporting its potential in real-world diagnostics.

Abstract: Reversible image conversion (RIC) suffers from ill-posedness issues due to its forward conversion process being considered an underdetermined system. Despite employing invertible neural networks (INN), existing RIC methods intrinsically remain ill-posed as inevitably introducing uncertainty by incorporating randomly sampled variables. To tackle the ill-posedness dilemma, we focus on developing a reliable approximate left inverse for the underdetermined system by constructing an overdetermined system with a non-zero Gram determinant, thus ensuring a well-posed solution. Based on this principle, we propose a well-posed invertible $1\times1$ convolution (WIC), which eliminates the reliance on random variable sampling and enables the development of well-posed invertible networks. Furthermore, we design two innovative networks, WIN-Na\"ive and WIN, with the latter incorporating advanced skip-connections to enhance long-term memory. Our methods are evaluated across diverse RIC tasks, including reversible image hiding, image rescaling, and image decolorization, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to overcome the bottlenecks of existing RIC solutions and setting a new benchmark in the field. Codes are available in https://github.com/BNU-ERC-ITEA/WIN.

Abstract: Articulated object recognition -- the task of identifying both the geometry and kinematic joints of objects with movable parts -- is essential for enabling robots to interact with everyday objects such as doors and laptops. However, existing approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as a known number of articulated parts; require additional inputs, such as depth images; or involve complex intermediate steps that can introduce potential errors -- limiting their practicality in real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce ScrewSplat, a simple end-to-end method that operates solely on RGB observations. Our approach begins by randomly initializing screw axes, which are then iteratively optimized to recover the object's underlying kinematic structure. By integrating with Gaussian Splatting, we simultaneously reconstruct the 3D geometry and segment the object into rigid, movable parts. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy across a diverse set of articulated objects, and further enables zero-shot, text-guided manipulation using the recovered kinematic model.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a key step in robotic perception tasks, such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). It is especially challenging in conditions with sparse points and heavy noise. Traditional registration methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions Transform (NDT), often have difficulties in achieving a robust and accurate alignment under these conditions. In this paper, we propose a registration framework based on moment matching. In particular, the point clouds are regarded as i.i.d. samples drawn from the same distribution observed in the source and target frames. We then match the generalized Gaussian Radial Basis moments calculated from the point clouds to estimate the rigid transformation between two frames. Moreover, such method does not require explicit point-to-point correspondences among the point clouds. We further show the consistency of the proposed method. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our approach achieves higher accuracy and robustness than existing methods. In addition, we integrate our framework into a 4D Radar SLAM system. The proposed method significantly improves the localization performance and achieves results comparable to LiDAR-based systems. These findings demonstrate the potential of moment matching technique for robust point cloud registration in sparse and noisy scenarios.

<title>Toward a reliable PWM-based light-emitting diode visual stimulus for improved SSVEP response with minimal visual fatigue</title>

Abstract: Steady state visual evoked response (SSVEP) is widely used in visual-based diagnosis and applications such as brain computer interfacing due to its high information transfer rate and the capability to activate commands through simple gaze control. However, one major impediment in using flashing visual stimulus to obtain SSVEP is eye fatigue that prevents continued long term use preventing practical deployment. This combined with the difficulty in establishing precise pulse-width modulation (PWM) that results in poorer accuracy warrants the development of appropriate approach to solve these issues. Various studies have suggested the usage of high frequencies of visual stimulus to reduce the visual fatigue for the user but this results in poor response performance. Here, the authors study the use of extremely high duty-cycles in the stimulus in the hope of solving these constraints. Electroencephalogram data was recorded with PWM duty-cycles of 50 to 95% generated by a precise custom-made light-emitting diode hardware and tested ten subjects responded that increasing duty-cycles had less visual strain for all the frequency values and the SSVEP exhibited a subject-independent peak response for duty-cycle of 85%. This could pave the way for increased usage of SSVEP for practical applications.

Abstract: Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise, particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric condition, namely $\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error $\epsilon$. Essentially, $\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the loss function. We prove theoretically that $\epsilon$-softmax can achieve noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss function. Recognizing that $\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and effective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise. The code is available at https://github.com/cswjl/eps-softmax.

Abstract: The control of robots for manipulation tasks generally relies on visual input. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) enable the use of natural language instructions to condition visual input and control robots in a wider range of environments. However, existing methods require a large amount of data to fine-tune VLMs for operating in unseen environments. In this paper, we present a framework that learns object-arrangement tasks from just a few demonstrations. We propose a two-stage framework that divides object-arrangement tasks into a target localization stage, for picking the object, and a region determination stage for placing the object. We present an instance-level semantic fusion module that aligns the instance-level image crops with the text embedding, enabling the model to identify the target objects defined by the natural language instructions. We validate our method on both simulation and real-world robotic environments. Our method, fine-tuned with a few demonstrations, improves generalization capability and demonstrates zero-shot ability in real-robot manipulation scenarios.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising approach for CT reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on the average gradient magnitude of points within the view, often leading to severe needle-like artifacts under sparse-view conditions. To address this challenge, we propose GR-Gaussian, a graph-based 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that suppresses needle-like artifacts and improves reconstruction accuracy under sparse-view conditions. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a Denoised Point Cloud Initialization Strategy that reduces initialization errors and accelerates convergence; and (2) a Pixel-Graph-Aware Gradient Strategy that refines gradient computation using graph-based density differences, improving splitting accuracy and density representation. Experiments on X-3D and real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of GR-Gaussian, achieving PSNR improvements of 0.67 dB and 0.92 dB, and SSIM gains of 0.011 and 0.021. These results highlight the applicability of GR-Gaussian for accurate CT reconstruction under challenging sparse-view conditions.

Abstract: Identifying actionable driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can impact treatment decisions and significantly improve patient outcomes. Despite guideline recommendations, broader adoption of genetic testing remains challenging due to limited availability and lengthy turnaround times. Machine Learning (ML) methods for Computational Pathology (CPath) offer a potential solution; however, research often focuses on only one or two common mutations, limiting the clinical value of these tools and the pool of patients who can benefit from them. This study evaluates various Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) techniques to detect six key actionable NSCLC driver mutations: ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, and MET ex14. Additionally, we introduce an Asymmetric Transformer Decoder model that employs queries and key-values of varying dimensions to maintain a low query dimensionality. This approach efficiently extracts information from patch embeddings and minimizes overfitting risks, proving highly adaptable to the MIL setting. Moreover, we present a method to directly utilize tissue type in the model, addressing a typical MIL limitation where either all regions or only some specific regions are analyzed, neglecting biological relevance. Our method outperforms top MIL models by an average of 3%, and over 4% when predicting rare mutations such as ERBB2 and BRAF, moving ML-based tests closer to being practical alternatives to standard genetic testing.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel method for uncertainty estimation (UE) in Gaussian Splatting. UE is crucial for using Gaussian Splatting in critical applications such as robotics and medicine. Previous methods typically estimate the variance of Gaussian primitives and use the rendering process to obtain pixel-wise uncertainties. Our method establishes primitive representations of error and visibility of trainings views, which carries meaningful uncertainty information. This representation is obtained by projection of training error and visibility onto the primitives. Uncertainties of novel views are obtained by rendering the primitive representations of uncertainty for those novel views, yielding uncertainty feature maps. To aggregate these uncertainty feature maps of novel views, we perform a pixel-wise regression on holdout data. In our experiments, we analyze the different components of our method, investigating various combinations of uncertainty feature maps and regression models. Furthermore, we considered the effect of separating splatting into foreground and background. Our UEs show high correlations to true errors, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially on foreground objects. The trained regression models show generalization capabilities to new scenes, allowing uncertainty estimation without the need for holdout data.

Abstract: Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical notes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However, these approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the clinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to make diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or ``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these nuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better incorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image analysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of clinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert uncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which significantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes. The source code and model weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/losehu/QuaDreamer.

Abstract: The proliferation of audio deepfakes poses a growing threat to trust in digital communications. While detection methods have advanced, attributing audio deepfakes to their source models remains an underexplored yet crucial challenge. In this paper we introduce LAVA (Layered Architecture for Voice Attribution), a hierarchical framework for audio deepfake detection and model recognition that leverages attention-enhanced latent representations extracted by a convolutional autoencoder trained solely on fake audio. Two specialized classifiers operate on these features: Audio Deepfake Attribution (ADA), which identifies the generation technology, and Audio Deepfake Model Recognition (ADMR), which recognize the specific generative model instance. To improve robustness under open-set conditions, we incorporate confidence-based rejection thresholds. Experiments on ASVspoof2021, FakeOrReal, and CodecFake show strong performance: the ADA classifier achieves F1-scores over 95% across all datasets, and the ADMR module reaches 96.31% macro F1 across six classes. Additional tests on unseen attacks from ASVpoof2019 LA and error propagation analysis confirm LAVA's robustness and reliability. The framework advances the field by introducing a supervised approach to deepfake attribution and model recognition under open-set conditions, validated on public benchmarks and accompanied by publicly released models and code. Models and code are available at https://www.github.com/adipiz99/lava-framework.

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining is the clinical standard for assessing tissue morphology, but it lacks molecular-level diagnostic information. In contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides crucial insights into biomarker expression, such as HER2 status for breast cancer grading, but remains costly and time-consuming, limiting its use in time-sensitive clinical workflows. To address this gap, virtual staining from H&amp;E to IHC has emerged as a promising alternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of synthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving structural integrity and biological variability during translation. To this end, we present an end-to-end framework encompassing both generation and evaluation in this work. We introduce Star-Diff, a structure-aware staining restoration diffusion model that reformulates virtual staining as an image restoration task. By combining residual and noise-based generation pathways, Star-Diff maintains tissue structure while modeling realistic biomarker variability. To evaluate the diagnostic consistency of the generated IHC patches, we propose the Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS), a clinical-grading-task-driven metric that quantifies class-wise semantic degradation based on biomarker classification accuracy. Unlike pixel-level metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, SFS remains robust under spatial misalignment and classifier uncertainty. Experiments on the BCI dataset demonstrate that Star-Diff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both visual fidelity and diagnostic relevance. With rapid inference and strong clinical alignment,it presents a practical solution for applications such as intraoperative virtual IHC synthesis.

<title>RL-U$^2$Net: A Dual-Branch UNet with Reinforcement Learning-Assisted Multimodal Feature Fusion for Accurate 3D Whole-Heart Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Accurate whole-heart segmentation is a critical component in the precise diagnosis and interventional planning of cardiovascular diseases. Integrating complementary information from modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can significantly enhance segmentation accuracy and robustness. However, existing multi-modal segmentation methods face several limitations: severe spatial inconsistency between modalities hinders effective feature fusion; fusion strategies are often static and lack adaptability; and the processes of feature alignment and segmentation are decoupled and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose a dual-branch U-Net architecture enhanced by reinforcement learning for feature alignment, termed RL-U$^2$Net, designed for precise and efficient multi-modal 3D whole-heart segmentation. The model employs a dual-branch U-shaped network to process CT and MRI patches in parallel, and introduces a novel RL-XAlign module between the encoders. The module employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture semantic correspondences between modalities and a reinforcement-learning agent learns an optimal rotation strategy that consistently aligns anatomical pose and texture features. The aligned features are then reconstructed through their respective decoders. Finally, an ensemble-learning-based decision module integrates the predictions from individual patches to produce the final segmentation result. Experimental results on the publicly available MM-WHS 2017 dataset demonstrate that the proposed RL-U$^2$Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving Dice coefficients of 93.1% on CT and 87.0% on MRI, thereby validating the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.

<title>Explainable AI Methods for Neuroimaging: Systematic Failures of Common Tools, the Need for Domain-Specific Validation, and a Proposal for Safe Application</title>

Abstract: Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad, which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a Geometry-aware Neural Interpolation (Geo-NI) framework for light field rendering. Previous learning-based approaches either rely on the capability of neural networks to perform direct interpolation, which we dubbed Neural Interpolation (NI), or explore scene geometry for novel view synthesis, also known as Depth Image-Based Rendering (DIBR). Instead, we incorporate the ideas behind these two kinds of approaches by launching the NI with a novel DIBR pipeline. Specifically, the proposed Geo-NI first performs NI using input light field sheared by a set of depth hypotheses. Then the DIBR is implemented by assigning the sheared light fields with a novel reconstruction cost volume according to the reconstruction quality under different depth hypotheses. The reconstruction cost is interpreted as a blending weight to render the final output light field by blending the reconstructed light fields along the dimension of depth hypothesis. By combining the superiorities of NI and DIBR, the proposed Geo-NI is able to render views with large disparity with the help of scene geometry while also reconstruct non-Lambertian effect when depth is prone to be ambiguous. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed geometry-aware light field rendering framework.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, in which DNNs are misled to false outputs due to inputs containing imperceptible perturbations. Adversarial training, a reliable and effective method of defense, may significantly reduce the vulnerability of neural networks and becomes the de facto standard for robust learning. While many recent works practice the data-centric philosophy, such as how to generate better adversarial examples or use generative models to produce additional training data, we look back to the models themselves and revisit the adversarial robustness from the perspective of deep feature distribution as an insightful complementarity. In this paper, we propose \textit{Branch Orthogonality adveRsarial Training} (BORT) to obtain state-of-the-art performance with solely the original dataset for adversarial training. To practice our design idea of integrating multiple orthogonal solution spaces, we leverage a simple and straightforward multi-branch neural network that eclipses adversarial attacks with no increase in inference time. We heuristically propose a corresponding loss function, branch-orthogonal loss, to make each solution space of the multi-branch model orthogonal. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN against $\ell_{\infty}$ norm-bounded perturbations of size $\epsilon = 8/255$, respectively. Exhaustive experiments are conducted to show that our method goes beyond all state-of-the-art methods without any tricks. Compared to all methods that do not use additional data for training, our models achieve 67.3\% and 41.5\% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 (improving upon the state-of-the-art by +7.23\% and +9.07\%). We also outperform methods using a training set with a far larger scale than ours.

Abstract: Segmentation is a crucial analysis task in biomedical imaging. Given the diverse experimental settings in this field, the lack of generalization limits the use of deep learning in practice. Domain adaptation is a promising remedy: it involves training a model for a given task on a source dataset with labels and adapts it to a target dataset without additional labels. We introduce a probabilistic domain adaptation method, building on self-training approaches and the Probabilistic UNet. We use the latter to sample multiple segmentation hypotheses to implement better pseudo-label filtering. We further study joint and separate source-target training strategies and evaluate our method on three challenging domain adaptation tasks for biomedical segmentation. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/Probabilistic-Domain-Adaptation.

Abstract: Image Aesthetics Assessment (IAA) is a challenging task due to its subjective nature and expensive manual annotations. Recent large-scale vision-language models, such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), have shown their promising representation capability for various downstream tasks. However, the application of CLIP to resource-constrained and low-data IAA tasks remains limited. While few attempts to leverage CLIP in IAA have mainly focused on carefully designed prompts, we extend beyond this by allowing models from different domains and with different model sizes to acquire knowledge from CLIP. To achieve this, we propose a unified and flexible two-phase CLIP-based Semi-supervised Knowledge Distillation (CSKD) paradigm, aiming to learn a lightweight IAA model while leveraging CLIP's strong generalization capability. Specifically, CSKD employs a feature alignment strategy to facilitate the distillation of heterogeneous CLIP teacher and IAA student models, effectively transferring valuable features from pre-trained visual representations to two lightweight IAA models, respectively. To efficiently adapt to downstream IAA tasks in a low-data regime, the two strong visual aesthetics learners then conduct distillation with unlabeled examples for refining and transferring the task-specific knowledge collaboratively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CSKD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple widely used IAA benchmarks. Furthermore, analysis of attention distance and entropy before and after feature alignment shows the effective transfer of CLIP's feature representation to IAA models, which not only provides valuable guidance for the model initialization of IAA but also enhances the aesthetic feature representation of IAA models. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel multimodal food recognition framework that effectively combines visual and textual modalities to enhance classification accuracy and robustness. The proposed approach employs a dynamic multimodal fusion strategy that adaptively integrates features from unimodal visual inputs and complementary textual metadata. This fusion mechanism is designed to maximize the use of informative content, while mitigating the adverse impact of missing or inconsistent modality data. The framework was rigorously evaluated on the UPMC Food-101 dataset and achieved unimodal classification accuracies of 73.60% for images and 88.84% for text. When both modalities were fused, the model achieved an accuracy of 97.84%, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experimental analysis demonstrated the robustness, adaptability, and computational efficiency of the proposed settings, highlighting its practical applicability to real-world multimodal food-recognition scenarios.

Abstract: A major source of endoscopic tissue tracking errors during deformations stems from wrong data association between observed sensor measurements with previously tracked scene. To mitigate this issue, we present a surgical perception framework, SuPerPM, that leverages learning-based non-rigid point cloud matching for data association, thus accommodating larger deformations than previous approaches which relied on Iterative Closest Point (ICP) for point associations. The learning models typically require training data with ground truth point cloud correspondences, which is challenging or even impractical to collect in surgical environments. Thus, for tuning the learning model, we gather endoscopic data of soft tissue being manipulated by a surgical robot and then establish correspondences between point clouds at different time points to serve as ground truth. This was achieved by employing a position-based dynamics (PBD) simulation to ensure that the correspondences adhered to physical constraints. The proposed framework is demonstrated on several challenging surgical datasets that are characterized by large deformations, achieving superior performance over advanced surgical scene tracking algorithms.

Abstract: We introduce a framework for joint grounded scene graph - image generation, a challenging task involving high-dimensional, multi-modal structured data. To effectively model this complex joint distribution, we adopt a factorized approach: first generating a grounded scene graph, followed by image generation conditioned on the generated grounded scene graph. While conditional image generation has been widely explored in the literature, our primary focus is on the generation of grounded scene graphs from noise, which provides efficient and interpretable control over the image generation process. This task requires generating plausible grounded scene graphs with heterogeneous attributes for both nodes (objects) and edges (relations among objects), encompassing continuous attributes (e.g., object bounding boxes) and discrete attributes (e.g., object and relation categories). To address this challenge, we introduce DiffuseSG, a novel diffusion model that jointly models the heterogeneous node and edge attributes. We explore different encoding strategies to effectively handle the categorical data. Leveraging a graph transformer as the denoiser, DiffuseSG progressively refines grounded scene graph representations in a continuous space before discretizing them to generate structured outputs. Additionally, we introduce an IoU-based regularization term to enhance empirical performance. Our model outperforms existing methods in grounded scene graph generation on the VG and COCO-Stuff datasets, excelling in both standard and newly introduced metrics that more accurately capture the task's complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the broader applicability of DiffuseSG in two important downstream tasks: 1) achieving superior results in a range of grounded scene graph completion tasks, and 2) enhancing grounded scene graph detection models by leveraging additional training samples generated by DiffuseSG.

Abstract: Generating dynamic 3D object from a single-view video is challenging due to the lack of 4D labeled data. An intuitive approach is to extend previous image-to-3D pipelines by transferring off-the-shelf image generation models such as score distillation sampling.However, this approach would be slow and expensive to scale due to the need for back-propagating the information-limited supervision signals through a large pretrained model. To address this, we propose an efficient video-to-4D object generation framework called Efficient4D. It generates high-quality spacetime-consistent images under different camera views, and then uses them as labeled data to directly reconstruct the 4D content through a 4D Gaussian splatting model. Importantly, our method can achieve real-time rendering under continuous camera trajectories. To enable robust reconstruction under sparse views, we introduce inconsistency-aware confidence-weighted loss design, along with a lightly weighted score distillation loss. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real videos show that Efficient4D offers a remarkable 10-fold increase in speed when compared to prior art alternatives while preserving the quality of novel view synthesis. For example, Efficient4D takes only 10 minutes to model a dynamic object, vs 120 minutes by the previous art model Consistent4D.

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) for video understanding are primarily fine-tuned with various videos scraped from online platforms. Existing datasets, such as ActivityNet, require considerable human labor for structuring and annotation before effectively utilized for tuning LVLMs. While current LVLMs are primarily trained on existing datasets in broad, general-purpose settings, adapting them to specific downstream scenarios remains challenging, as collecting and annotating task-specific videos is highly labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a three-stage framework named DreamFrame for automatically generating style-consistent keyframes and corresponding question-answer (QA) pairs to support LVLM instruction tuning. DreamFrame generates datasets in a movie-like manner. First, we utilize an LLM to generate structured movie plots including movie prior information (like overview and style), frame descriptions and plot-related QA pairs, with a story expansion strategy to mitigate context length limitations.Then, to ensure visual consistency across generated frames, we design a Style Immobilization Process which maintains consistent style through an embedding learning strategy. Finally, frame descriptions and style embeddings are integrated to produce coherent keyframes. Using DreamFrame, we construct a dataset comprising approximately 1k stylized keyframe-like videos and 100k diverse QA pairs. Extensive fine-tuned experiments on various LVLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset. Furthermore, based on the proposed dataset, we fine-tune a new LVLM named DreamFrame-7B, which significantly surpasses the previous similar-sized LVLMs across different benchmarks.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Part-Aware Point Grounded Description (PaPGD), a challenging task aimed at advancing 3D multimodal learning for fine-grained, part-aware segmentation grounding and detailed explanation of 3D objects. Existing 3D datasets largely focus on either vision-only part segmentation or vision-language scene segmentation, lacking the fine-grained multimodal segmentation needed for robotic navigation and interaction in real-world environments. To address this gap, we present the 3DCoMPaT Grounded Instructions (3DCoMPaT-GrIn) Dataset, a comprehensive resource that pairs rich point cloud descriptions with corresponding part-level segmentation masks. This dataset encompasses extensive samples designed for both PaPGD and fine-grained single-part grounding tasks. To tackle the inherent challenges of grounding objects and generating grounded descriptions at the part level, we propose Kestrel, a part-aware 3D multimodal large language model that integrates an advanced language model for nuanced language comprehension with multi-level point feature propagation and query refinement mechanism to enhance spatial reasoning at the part level. The extensive experiments demonstrate that Kestrel effectively bridges the gap between part-aware language understanding and 3D segmentation grounding, paving the way for more robust and interpretable 3D object comprehension that meets the demands of real-world robotic applications.

Abstract: Local learning offers an alternative to traditional end-to-end back-propagation in deep neural networks, significantly reducing GPU memory consumption. Although it has shown promise in image classification tasks, its extension to other visual tasks has been limited. This limitation arises primarily from two factors: 1) architectures designed specifically for classification are not readily adaptable to other tasks, which prevents the effective reuse of task-specific knowledge from architectures tailored to different problems; 2) these classification-focused architectures typically lack cross-scale feature communication, leading to degraded performance in tasks like object detection and super-resolution. To address these challenges, we propose the Feature Bank Augmented auxiliary network (FBA), which introduces a simplified design principle and incorporates a feature bank to enhance cross-task adaptability and communication. This work represents the first successful application of local learning methods beyond classification, demonstrating that FBA not only conserves GPU memory but also achieves performance on par with end-to-end approaches across multiple datasets for various visual tasks.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D Object Detection (OV-3DDet) addresses the detection of objects from an arbitrary list of novel categories in 3D scenes, which remains a very challenging problem. In this work, we propose CoDAv2, a unified framework designed to innovatively tackle both the localization and classification of novel 3D objects, under the condition of limited base categories. For localization, the proposed 3D Novel Object Discovery (3D-NOD) strategy utilizes 3D geometries and 2D open-vocabulary semantic priors to discover pseudo labels for novel objects during training. 3D-NOD is further extended with an Enrichment strategy that significantly enriches the novel object distribution in the training scenes, and then enhances the model's ability to localize more novel objects. The 3D-NOD with Enrichment is termed 3D-NODE. For classification, the Discovery-driven Cross-modal Alignment (DCMA) module aligns features from 3D point clouds and 2D/textual modalities, employing both class-agnostic and class-specific alignments that are iteratively refined to handle the expanding vocabulary of objects. Besides, 2D box guidance boosts the classification accuracy against complex background noises, which is coined as Box-DCMA. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the superiority of CoDAv2. CoDAv2 outperforms the best-performing method by a large margin (AP_Novel of 9.17 vs. 3.61 on SUN-RGBD and 9.12 vs. 3.74 on ScanNetv2). Source code and pre-trained models are available at the GitHub project page.

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) present fundamental computational challenges due to their gigapixel-scale resolutions and sparse, irregularly distributed informative regions. Conventional patch-based methods inevitably distort spatial relationships or treat patches as independent samples, while traditional attention mechanisms, designed for dense, uniformly distributed data, are computationally impractical for WSIs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel sparse-native computational framework that preserves exact spatial relationships, unlocking advanced modeling techniques and bridging a long-standing gap between WSI analysis and general vision. Based on this framework, we develop Sparse Pyramid Attention Networks (SPAN), incorporating a hierarchical sparse pyramid attention architecture with shifted windows that efficiently directs computational resources to informative regions. SPAN comprises two key modules: Spatial-Adaptive Feature Condensation, which progressively builds multi-scale representations from a single-scale input through sparse downsampling, and Context-Aware Feature Refinement, which captures long-range dependencies via shifted windows and global tokens. Evaluations on multiple public datasets demonstrate SPAN's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, validating both our framework's effectiveness and SPAN's specific advantages in capturing contextual and hierachical representations that existing methods fundamentally cannot model. Our work establishes a new paradigm for WSI analysis that overcomes long-standing computational barriers. The code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) aims to develop agents capable of navigating in realistic environments. While recent cross-modal training approaches have significantly improved navigation performance in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, aerial navigation over real-world cities remains underexplored primarily due to limited datasets and the difficulty of integrating visual and geographic information. To fill this gap, we introduce CityNav, the first large-scale real-world dataset for aerial VLN. Our dataset consists of 32,637 human demonstration trajectories, each paired with a natural language description, covering 4.65 km$^2$ across two real cities: Cambridge and Birmingham. In contrast to existing datasets composed of synthetic scenes such as AerialVLN, our dataset presents a unique challenge because agents must interpret spatial relationships between real-world landmarks and the navigation destination, making CityNav an essential benchmark for advancing aerial VLN. Furthermore, as an initial step toward addressing this challenge, we provide a methodology of creating geographic semantic maps that can be used as an auxiliary modality input during navigation. In our experiments, we compare performance of three representative aerial VLN agents (Seq2seq, CMA and AerialVLN models) and demonstrate that the semantic map representation significantly improves their navigation performance.

Abstract: Comprehending natural language instructions is a charming property for both 2D and 3D layout synthesis systems. Existing methods implicitly model object joint distributions and express object relations, hindering generation's controllability. We introduce InstructLayout, a novel generative framework that integrates a semantic graph prior and a layout decoder to improve controllability and fidelity for 2D and 3D layout synthesis. The proposed semantic graph prior learns layout appearances and object distributions simultaneously, demonstrating versatility across various downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner. To facilitate the benchmarking for text-driven 2D and 3D scene synthesis, we respectively curate two high-quality datasets of layout-instruction pairs from public Internet resources with large language and multimodal models. Extensive experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in both 2D and 3D layout synthesis tasks. Thorough ablation studies confirm the efficacy of crucial design components.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently shown notable success in various visual tasks. However, in terms of discriminability, SSL is still not on par with supervised learning (SL). This paper identifies a key issue, the ``crowding problem," where features from different classes are not well-separated, and there is high intra-class variance. In contrast, SL ensures clear class separation. Our analysis reveals that SSL objectives do not adequately constrain the relationships between samples and their augmentations, leading to poorer performance in complex tasks. We further establish a theoretical framework that connects SSL objectives to cross-entropy risk bounds, explaining how reducing intra-class variance and increasing inter-class separation can improve generalization. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Semantic Adjuster (DSA), a learnable regulator that enhances feature aggregation and separation while being robust to outliers. Comprehensive experiments conducted on diverse benchmark datasets validate that DSA leads to substantial gains in SSL performance, narrowing the performance gap with SL.

<title>The Inter-Intra Modal Measure: A Predictive Lens on Fine-Tuning Outcomes in Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: The fine-tuning of large vision-language foundation models remains an underexplored area, particularly regarding its impact on learning gains and catastrophic forgetting. Inspired by the significance of modality gaps in contrastive dual-encoders, we introduce the Inter-Intra Modal Measure (IIMM) - a predictive metric that quantifies the relationship between intra-modal image embedding similarity and inter-modal misalignment. Through extensive empirical analysis across four state-of-the-art vision-language models and five fine-tuning techniques, we establish a strong linear relationship: tasks with higher IIMM scores yield greater in-domain performance improvements but suffer from more pronounced out-of-domain degradation, with some parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods exhibiting severe forgetting. Compared to existing transferability measures, the IIMM demonstrates significantly stronger predictive power for accuracy changes post fine-tuning in dual-encoder models. Moreover, we provide a theoretical bound, proving that changes in IIMM are limited by the Wasserstein distance between pre- and post-fine-tuning embedding distributions, ensuring its stability and robustness as a predictive measure. With only a single forward pass of the target data, practitioners can leverage this key insight to evaluate the degree to which a model can be expected to improve following fine-tuning. When combined with prior knowledge of a model's performance across diverse tasks, the IIMM further enhances transferability predictions for novel tasks, offering a lightweight yet effective tool for guiding model adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as an effective representation for photorealistic rendering, but the underlying geometry, material, and lighting remain entangled, hindering scene editing. Existing GS-based methods struggle to disentangle these components under non-Lambertian conditions, especially in the presence of specularities and shadows. We propose \textbf{GS-ID}, an end-to-end framework for illumination decomposition that integrates adaptive light aggregation with diffusion-based material priors. In addition to a learnable environment map for ambient illumination, we model spatially-varying local lighting using anisotropic spherical Gaussian mixtures (SGMs) that are jointly optimized with scene content. To better capture cast shadows, we associate each splat with a learnable unit vector that encodes shadow directions from multiple light sources, further improving material and lighting estimation. By combining SGMs with intrinsic priors from diffusion models, GS-ID significantly reduces ambiguity in light-material-geometry interactions and achieves state-of-the-art performance on inverse rendering and relighting benchmarks. Experiments also demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-ID for downstream applications such as relighting and scene composition.

Abstract: Real-time high-accuracy optical flow estimation is critical for a variety of real-world robotic applications. However, current learning-based methods often struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency: methods that achieve high accuracy typically demand substantial processing power, while faster approaches tend to sacrifice precision. These fast approaches specifically falter in their generalization capabilities and do not perform well across diverse real-world scenarios. In this work, we revisit the limitations of the SOTA methods and present NeuFlow-V2, a novel method that offers both - high accuracy in real-world datasets coupled with low computational overhead. In particular, we introduce a novel light-weight backbone and a fast refinement module to keep computational demands tractable while delivering accurate optical flow. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NeuFlow-V2 provides similar accuracy to SOTA methods while achieving 10x-70x speedups. It is capable of running at over 20 FPS on 512x384 resolution images on a Jetson Orin Nano. The full training and evaluation code is available at https://github.com/neufieldrobotics/NeuFlow_v2.

Abstract: It has been widely substantiated that deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible and vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Existing studies mainly focus on performing attacks by corrupting targeted objects (physical attack) or images (digital attack), which is intuitively acceptable and understandable in terms of the attack's effectiveness. In contrast, our focus lies in conducting background adversarial attacks in both digital and physical domains, without causing any disruptions to the targeted objects themselves. Specifically, an effective background adversarial attack framework is proposed to attack anything, by which the attack efficacy generalizes well between diverse objects, models, and tasks. Technically, we approach the background adversarial attack as an iterative optimization problem, analogous to the process of DNN learning. Besides, we offer a theoretical demonstration of its convergence under a set of mild but sufficient conditions. To strengthen the attack efficacy and transferability, we propose a new ensemble strategy tailored for adversarial perturbations and introduce an improved smooth constraint for the seamless connection of integrated perturbations. We conduct comprehensive and rigorous experiments in both digital and physical domains across various objects, models, and tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of attacking anything of the proposed method. The findings of this research substantiate the significant discrepancy between human and machine vision on the value of background variations, which play a far more critical role than previously recognized, necessitating a reevaluation of the robustness and reliability of DNNs. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/JiaweiLian/Attack_Anything

Abstract: Recent advancements in large-scale video-language models have shown significant potential for real-time planning and detailed interactions. However, their high computational demands and the scarcity of annotated datasets limit their practicality for academic researchers. In this work, we introduce VideoLLaMB, a novel and efficient framework for long video understanding that leverages recurrent memory bridges and temporal memory tokens to enable seamless encoding of entire video sequences with preserved semantic continuity. Central to our approach is a SceneTiling algorithm that segments videos into coherent semantic units, facilitating robust understanding across tasks without requiring additional training. VideoLLaMB achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing models by 4.2 points on four VideoQA benchmarks and by 2.06 points on egocentric planning tasks. Notably, it maintains strong performance under extreme video length scaling (up to 8 times) and excels at fine-grained frame retrieval on our proposed Needle in a Video Haystack (NIAVH) benchmark. With linear GPU memory scaling, VideoLLaMB processes up to 320 frames using a single Nvidia A100 GPU, despite being trained on only 16 frames-offering an unprecedented balance of accuracy, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. This makes it highly accessible and practical for the academic community.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) emerges as a pivotal and highly promising branch in the field of computer vision. Classical closed-vocabulary MOT (CV-MOT) methods aim to track objects of predefined categories. Recently, some open-vocabulary MOT (OV-MOT) methods have successfully addressed the problem of tracking unknown categories. However, we found that the CV-MOT and OV-MOT methods each struggle to excel in the tasks of the other. In this paper, we present a unified framework, Associate Everything Detected (AED), that simultaneously tackles CV-MOT and OV-MOT by integrating with any off-the-shelf detector and supports unknown categories. Different from existing tracking-by-detection MOT methods, AED gets rid of prior knowledge (e.g. motion cues) and relies solely on highly robust feature learning to handle complex trajectories in OV-MOT tasks while keeping excellent performance in CV-MOT tasks. Specifically, we model the association task as a similarity decoding problem and propose a sim-decoder with an association-centric learning mechanism. The sim-decoder calculates similarities in three aspects: spatial, temporal, and cross-clip. Subsequently, association-centric learning leverages these threefold similarities to ensure that the extracted features are appropriate for continuous tracking and robust enough to generalize to unknown categories. Compared with existing powerful OV-MOT and CV-MOT methods, AED achieves superior performance on TAO, SportsMOT, and DanceTrack without any prior knowledge.

Abstract: Perception systems play a crucial role in autonomous driving, incorporating multiple sensors and corresponding computer vision algorithms. 3D LiDAR sensors are widely used to capture sparse point clouds of the vehicle's surroundings. However, such systems struggle to perceive occluded areas and gaps in the scene due to the sparsity of these point clouds and their lack of semantics. To address these challenges, Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) jointly predicts unobserved geometry and semantics in the scene given raw LiDAR measurements, aiming for a more complete scene representation. Building on promising results of diffusion models in image generation and super-resolution tasks, we propose their extension to SSC by implementing the noising and denoising diffusion processes in the point and semantic spaces individually. To control the generation, we employ semantic LiDAR point clouds as conditional input and design local and global regularization losses to stabilize the denoising process. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving datasets, and it achieves state-of-the-art performance for SSC, surpassing most existing methods.

Abstract: Radiologists play a crucial role in translating medical images into actionable reports. However, the field faces staffing shortages and increasing workloads. While automated approaches using vision-language models (VLMs) show promise as assistants, they require exceptionally high accuracy. Most current VLMs in radiology rely solely on supervised fine-tuning. Meanwhile, additional preference fine-tuning in the post-training pipeline has become standard practice in the general domain. The challenge in radiology lies in the prohibitive cost of obtaining radiologist feedback at scale. To address this challenge, we propose an automated pipeline for preference feedback, focusing on chest X-ray radiology report generation (RRG). Specifically, our method leverages publicly available datasets containing pairs of images and radiologist-written reference reports with reference-based metrics, or Judges, eliminating the need for additional radiologist feedback. We investigate reward overoptimization via length exploitation in this setting and introduce a length-controlled version of the GREEN score. Our best-performing setup achieves state-of-the-art CheXbert scores on the MIMIC-CXR dataset for the RRG task while on average maintaining robust performance across six additional image perception and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Animation data is often obtained through optical motion capture systems, which utilize a multitude of cameras to establish the position of optical markers. However, system errors or occlusions can result in missing markers, the manual cleaning of which can be time-consuming. This has sparked interest in machine learning-based solutions for missing marker reconstruction in the academic community. Most academic papers utilize a simplistic mean square error as the main metric. In this paper, we show that this metric does not correlate with subjective perception of the fill quality. Additionally, we introduce and evaluate a set of better-correlated metrics that can drive progress in the field.

Abstract: Previous methods utilize the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) for panoptic lifting, while their training and rendering speed are unsatisfactory. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a prominent technique due to its rapid training and rendering speed. However, unlike NeRF, the conventional 3DGS may not satisfy the basic smoothness assumption as it does not rely on any parameterized structures to render (e.g., MLPs). Consequently, the conventional 3DGS is, in nature, more susceptible to noisy 2D mask supervision. In this paper, we propose a new method called PLGS that enables 3DGS to generate consistent panoptic segmentation masks from noisy 2D segmentation masks while maintaining superior efficiency compared to NeRF-based methods. Specifically, we build a panoptic-aware structured 3D Gaussian model to introduce smoothness and design effective noise reduction strategies. For the semantic field, instead of initialization with structure from motion, we construct reliable semantic anchor points to initialize the 3D Gaussians. We then use these anchor points as smooth regularization during training. Additionally, we present a self-training approach using pseudo labels generated by merging the rendered masks with the noisy masks to enhance the robustness of PLGS. For the instance field, we project the 2D instance masks into 3D space and match them with oriented bounding boxes to generate cross-view consistent instance masks for supervision. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of both segmentation quality and speed.

Abstract: Text logo design heavily relies on the creativity and expertise of professional designers, in which arranging element layouts is one of the most important procedures. However, this specific task has received limited attention, often overshadowed by broader layout generation tasks such as document or poster design. In this paper, we propose a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based framework that generates content-aware text logo layouts by integrating multi-modal inputs with user-defined constraints, enabling more flexible and robust layout generation for real-world applications. We introduce two model techniques that reduce the computational cost for processing multiple glyph images simultaneously, without compromising performance. To support instruction tuning of our model, we construct two extensive text logo datasets that are five times larger than existing public datasets. In addition to geometric annotations (\textit{e.g.}, text masks and character recognition), our datasets include detailed layout descriptions in natural language, enabling the model to reason more effectively in handling complex designs and custom user inputs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework and datasets, outperforming existing methods on various benchmarks that assess geometric aesthetics and human preferences.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenging task of multimodal mathematical reasoning by incorporating the notion of ``slow thinking'' into multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Our core idea is that models can learn to adaptively use different levels of reasoning to tackle questions of different complexity. We propose a novel paradigm of Self-structured Chain of Thought (SCoT), which comprises of minimal semantic atomic steps. Different from existing methods that rely on structured templates or free-form paradigms, our method can not only generate cognitive CoT structures for various complex tasks but also mitigates the phenomena of overthinking for easier tasks. To introduce structured reasoning into visual cognition, we further design a novel AtomThink framework with four key modules, including (i) a data engine to generate high-quality multimodal reasoning paths; (ii) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) process with serialized inference data; (iii) a policy-guided multi-turn inference method; and (iv) an atomic capability metric to evaluate the single step utilization rate. We conduct extensive experiments to show that the proposed AtomThink significantly improves the performance of baseline MLLMs, achieving more than 10\% average accuracy gains on MathVista and MathVerse. Compared to state-of-the-art structured CoT approaches, our method not only achieves higher accuracy but also improves data utilization by 5 times and boosts inference efficiency by 85.3\%. Our code is now public available in https://github.com/Quinn777/AtomThink.

Abstract: The recent development in multimodal learning has greatly advanced the research in 3D scene understanding in various real-world tasks such as embodied AI. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) they are short of reasoning ability for interaction and interpretation of human intentions and 2) they focus on scenarios with single-category objects and over-simplified textual descriptions and neglect multi-object scenarios with complicated spatial relations among objects. We address the above challenges by proposing a 3D reasoning segmentation task for reasoning segmentation with multiple objects in scenes. The task allows producing 3D segmentation masks and detailed textual explanations as enriched by 3D spatial relations among objects. To this end, we create ReasonSeg3D, a large-scale and high-quality benchmark that integrates 3D segmentation masks and 3D spatial relations with generated question-answer pairs. In addition, we design MORE3D, a novel 3D reasoning network that works with queries of multiple objects and is tailored for 3D scene understanding. MORE3D learns detailed explanations on 3D relations and employs them to capture spatial information of objects and reason textual outputs. Extensive experiments show that MORE3D excels in reasoning and segmenting complex multi-object 3D scenes. In addition, the created ReasonSeg3D offers a valuable platform for future exploration of 3D reasoning segmentation. The data and code will be released.

Abstract: The shared topology of human skeletons motivated the recent investigation of graph convolutional network (GCN) solutions for action recognition. However, most of the existing GCNs rely on the binary connection of two neighboring vertices (joints) formed by an edge (bone), overlooking the potential of constructing multi-vertex convolution structures. Although some studies have attempted to utilize hyper-graphs to represent the topology, they rely on a fixed construction strategy, which limits their adaptivity in uncovering the intricate latent relationships within the action. In this paper, we address this oversight and explore the merits of an adaptive hyper-graph convolutional network (Hyper-GCN) to achieve the aggregation of rich semantic information conveyed by skeleton vertices. In particular, our Hyper-GCN adaptively optimises the hyper-graphs during training, revealing the action-driven multi-vertex relations. Besides, virtual connections are often designed to support efficient feature aggregation, implicitly extending the spectrum of dependencies within the skeleton. By injecting virtual connections into hyper-graphs, the semantic clues of diverse action categories can be highlighted. The results of experiments conducted on the NTU-60, NTU-120, and NW-UCLA datasets demonstrate the merits of our Hyper-GCN, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Current human motion synthesis frameworks rely on global action descriptions, creating a modality gap that limits both motion understanding and generation capabilities. A single coarse description, such as run, fails to capture details such as variations in speed, limb positioning, and kinematic dynamics, leading to ambiguities between text and motion modalities. To address this challenge, we introduce KinMo, a unified framework built on a hierarchical describable motion representation that extends beyond global actions by incorporating kinematic group movements and their interactions. We design an automated annotation pipeline to generate high-quality, fine-grained descriptions for this decomposition, resulting in the KinMo dataset and offering a scalable and cost-efficient solution for dataset enrichment. To leverage these structured descriptions, we propose Hierarchical Text-Motion Alignment that progressively integrates additional motion details, thereby improving semantic motion understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a coarse-to-fine motion generation procedure to leverage enhanced spatial understanding to improve motion synthesis. Experimental results show that KinMo significantly improves motion understanding, demonstrated by enhanced text-motion retrieval performance and enabling more fine-grained motion generation and editing capabilities.

Abstract: Diffusion models have enabled the generation of high-quality images with a strong focus on realism and textual fidelity. Yet, large-scale text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, struggle to generate images where foreground objects are placed over a chroma key background, limiting their ability to separate foreground and background elements without fine-tuning. To address this limitation, we present a novel Training-Free Chroma Key Content Generation Diffusion Model (TKG-DM), which optimizes the initial random noise to produce images with foreground objects on a specifiable color background. Our proposed method is the first to explore the manipulation of the color aspects in initial noise for controlled background generation, enabling precise separation of foreground and background without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, matching or surpassing fine-tuned models. Finally, we successfully extend it to other tasks (e.g., consistency models and text-to-video), highlighting its transformative potential across various generative applications where independent control of foreground and background is crucial.

Abstract: We study $\textit{how}$ rich visual semantic information is represented within various layers and denoising timesteps of different diffusion architectures. We uncover monosemantic interpretable features by leveraging k-sparse autoencoders (k-SAE). We substantiate our mechanistic interpretations via transfer learning using light-weight classifiers on off-the-shelf diffusion models' features. On $4$ datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of diffusion features for representation learning. We provide an in-depth analysis of how different diffusion architectures, pre-training datasets, and language model conditioning impacts visual representation granularity, inductive biases, and transfer learning capabilities. Our work is a critical step towards deepening interpretability of black-box diffusion models. Code and visualizations available at: https://github.com/revelio-diffusion/revelio

Abstract: The emergence of neural rendering has significantly advanced the rendering quality of 3D human avatars, with the recently popular 3DGS technique enabling real-time performance. However, SMPL-driven 3DGS human avatars still struggle to capture fine appearance details due to the complex mapping from pose to appearance during fitting. In this paper, we propose SeqAvatar, which excavates the explicit 3DGS representation to better model human avatars based on a hierarchical motion context. Specifically, we utilize a coarse-to-fine motion conditions that incorporate both the overall human skeleton and fine-grained vertex motions for non-rigid deformation. To enhance the robustness of the proposed motion conditions, we adopt a spatio-temporal multi-scale sampling strategy to hierarchically integrate more motion clues to model human avatars. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms 3DGS-based approaches and renders human avatars orders of magnitude faster than the latest NeRF-based models that incorporate temporal context, all while delivering performance that is at least comparable or even superior.

<title>Individual Content and Motion Dynamics Preserved Pruning for Video Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: The high computational cost and slow inference time are major obstacles to deploying Video Diffusion Models (VDMs). To overcome this, we introduce a new Video Diffusion Model Compression approach using individual content and motion dynamics preserved pruning and consistency loss. First, we empirically observe that deeper VDM layers are crucial for maintaining the quality of \textbf{motion dynamics} (\textit{e.g.,} coherence of the entire video), while shallower layers are more focused on \textbf{individual content} (\textit{e.g.,} individual frames). Therefore, we prune redundant blocks from the shallower layers while preserving more of the deeper layers, resulting in a lightweight VDM variant called VDMini. Moreover, we propose an \textbf{Individual Content and Motion Dynamics (ICMD)} Consistency Loss to gain comparable generation performance as larger VDM to VDMini. In particular, we first use the Individual Content Distillation (ICD) Loss to preserve the consistency in the features of each generated frame between the teacher and student models. Next, we introduce a Multi-frame Content Adversarial (MCA) Loss to enhance the motion dynamics across the generated video as a whole. This method significantly accelerates inference time while maintaining high-quality video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our VDMini on two important video generation tasks, Text-to-Video (T2V) and Image-to-Video (I2V), where we respectively achieve an average 2.5 $\times$, 1.4 $\times$, and 1.25 $\times$ speed up for the I2V method SF-V, the T2V method T2V-Turbo-v2, and the T2V method HunyuanVideo, while maintaining the quality of the generated videos on several benchmarks including UCF101, VBench-T2V, and VBench-I2V.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has demonstrated notable success in large-scale scene reconstruction, but challenges persist due to high training memory consumption and storage overhead. Hybrid representations that integrate implicit and explicit features offer a way to mitigate these limitations. However, when applied in parallelized block-wise training, two critical issues arise since reconstruction accuracy deteriorates due to reduced data diversity when training each block independently, and parallel training restricts the number of divided blocks to the available number of GPUs. To address these issues, we propose Momentum-GS, a novel approach that leverages momentum-based self-distillation to promote consistency and accuracy across the blocks while decoupling the number of blocks from the physical GPU count. Our method maintains a teacher Gaussian decoder updated with momentum, ensuring a stable reference during training. This teacher provides each block with global guidance in a self-distillation manner, promoting spatial consistency in reconstruction. To further ensure consistency across the blocks, we incorporate block weighting, dynamically adjusting each block's weight according to its reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on large-scale scenes show that our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, achieving a 12.8% improvement in LPIPS over CityGaussian with much fewer divided blocks and establishing a new state of the art.

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible (IR-VIS) methods inherit the general representations of Pre-trained Visual Models (PVMs) to facilitate complementary learning. However, our analysis indicates that under the full fine-tuning paradigm, the feature space becomes highly constrained and low-ranked, which has been proven to seriously impair generalization. One solution is freezing parameters to preserve pre-trained knowledge and thus maintain diversity of the feature space. To this end, we propose IV-tuning, to parameter-efficiently harness PVMs for various IR-VIS downstream tasks, including salient object detection, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Compared with the full fine-tuning baselines and existing IR-VIS methods, IV-tuning facilitates the learning of complementary information between infrared and visible modalities with less than 3% of the backbone parameters, and effectively alleviates the overfitting problem. The code is available in https://github.com/Yummy198913/IV-tuning.

Abstract: We introduce GausSim, a novel neural network-based simulator designed to capture the dynamic behaviors of real-world elastic objects represented through Gaussian kernels. We leverage continuum mechanics and treat each kernel as a Center of Mass System (CMS) that represents continuous piece of matter, accounting for realistic deformations without idealized assumptions. To improve computational efficiency and fidelity, we employ a hierarchical structure that further organizes kernels into CMSs with explicit formulations, enabling a coarse-to-fine simulation approach. This structure significantly reduces computational overhead while preserving detailed dynamics. In addition, GausSim incorporates explicit physics constraints, such as mass and momentum conservation, ensuring interpretable results and robust, physically plausible simulations. To validate our approach, we present a new dataset, READY, containing multi-view videos of real-world elastic deformations. Experimental results demonstrate that GausSim achieves superior performance compared to existing physics-driven baselines, offering a practical and accurate solution for simulating complex dynamic behaviors. Code and model are available at our project page: https://www.mmlab-ntu.com/project/gausim/index.html .

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has achieved remarkable success by integrating information from various modalities, achieving superior performance in tasks like recognition and retrieval compared to uni-modal approaches. However, real-world scenarios often present novel modalities that are unseen during training due to resource and privacy constraints, a challenge current methods struggle to address. This paper introduces Modality Generalization (MG), which focuses on enabling models to generalize to unseen modalities. We define two cases: Weak MG, where both seen and unseen modalities can be mapped into a joint embedding space via existing perceptors, and Strong MG, where no such mappings exist. To facilitate progress, we propose a comprehensive benchmark featuring multi-modal algorithms and adapt existing methods that focus on generalization. Extensive experiments highlight the complexity of MG, exposing the limitations of existing methods and identifying key directions for future research. Our work provides a foundation for advancing robust and adaptable multi-modal models, enabling them to handle unseen modalities in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: The use of CLIP embeddings to assess the fidelity of samples produced by text-to-image generative models has been extensively explored in the literature. While the widely adopted CLIPScore, derived from the cosine similarity of text and image embeddings, effectively measures the alignment of a generated image, it does not quantify the diversity of images generated by a text-to-image model. In this work, we extend the application of CLIP embeddings to quantify and interpret the intrinsic diversity of text-to-image models, which are responsible for generating diverse images from similar text prompts, which we refer to as prompt-aware diversity. To achieve this, we propose a decomposition of the CLIP-based kernel covariance matrix of image data into text-based and non-text-based components. Using the Schur complement of the joint image-text kernel covariance matrix, we perform this decomposition and define the matrix-based entropy of the decomposed component as the Schur Complement ENtopy DIversity (Scendi) score, as a measure of the prompt-aware diversity for prompt-guided generative models. Additionally, we discuss the application of the Schur complement-based decomposition to nullify the influence of a given prompt on the CLIP embedding of an image, enabling focus or defocus of the embedded vectors on specific objects. We present several numerical results that apply our proposed Scendi score to evaluate text-to-image and LLM (text-to-text) models. Our numerical results indicate the success of the Scendi score in capturing the intrinsic diversity of prompt-guided generative models. The codebase is available at https://github.com/aziksh-ospanov/scendi-score.

Abstract: Balancing content fidelity and artistic style is a pivotal challenge in image generation. While traditional style transfer methods and modern Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) strive to achieve this balance, they often struggle to do so without sacrificing either style, content, or sometimes both. This work addresses this challenge by analyzing the ability of DDPMs to maintain content and style equilibrium. We introduce a novel method to identify sensitivities within the DDPM attention layers, identifying specific layers that correspond to different stylistic aspects. By directing conditional inputs only to these sensitive layers, our approach enables fine-grained control over style and content, significantly reducing issues arising from over-constrained inputs. Our findings demonstrate that this method enhances recent stylization techniques by better aligning style and content, ultimately improving the quality of generated visual content.

<title>From Age Estimation to Age-Invariant Face Recognition: Generalized Age Feature Extraction Using Order-Enhanced Contrastive Learning</title>

Abstract: Generalized age feature extraction is crucial for age-related facial analysis tasks, such as age estimation and age-invariant face recognition (AIFR). Despite the recent successes of models in homogeneous-dataset experiments, their performance drops significantly in cross-dataset evaluations. Most of these models fail to extract generalized age features as they only attempt to map extracted features with training age labels directly without explicitly modeling the natural ordinal progression of aging. In this paper, we propose Order-Enhanced Contrastive Learning (OrdCon), a novel contrastive learning framework designed explicitly for ordinal attributes like age. Specifically, to extract generalized features, OrdCon aligns the direction vector of two features with either the natural aging direction or its reverse to model the ordinal process of aging. To further enhance generalizability, OrdCon leverages a novel soft proxy matching loss as a second contrastive objective, ensuring that features are positioned around the center of each age cluster with minimal intra-class variance and proportionally away from other clusters. By modeling the ageing process, the framework can enhance generalizability by improving the alignment of samples from the same class and reducing the divergence of direction vectors. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark datasets in homogeneous-dataset evaluations for both age estimation and AIFR. In cross-dataset experiments, OrdCon outperforms other methods by reducing the mean absolute error by approximately 1.38 on average for the age estimation task and boosts the average accuracy for AIFR by 1.87%.

Abstract: Video tokenizers are essential for latent video diffusion models, converting raw video data into spatiotemporally compressed latent spaces for efficient training. However, extending state-of-the-art video tokenizers to achieve a temporal compression ratio beyond 4x without increasing channel capacity poses significant challenges. In this work, we propose an alternative approach to enhance temporal compression. We find that the reconstruction quality of temporally subsampled videos from a low-compression encoder surpasses that of high-compression encoders applied to original videos. This indicates that high-compression models can leverage representations from lower-compression models. Building on this insight, we develop a bootstrapped high-temporal-compression model that progressively trains high-compression blocks atop well-trained lower-compression models. Our method includes a cross-level feature-mixing module to retain information from the pretrained low-compression model and guide higher-compression blocks to capture the remaining details from the full video sequence. Evaluation of video benchmarks shows that our method significantly improves reconstruction quality while increasing temporal compression compared to directly training the full model. Furthermore, the resulting compact latent space effectively trains a video diffusion model for high-quality video generation with a significantly reduced token budget.

Abstract: Image tokenizers form the foundation of modern text-to-image generative models but are notoriously difficult to train. Furthermore, most existing text-to-image models rely on large-scale, high-quality private datasets, making them challenging to replicate. In this work, we introduce Text-Aware Transformer-based 1-Dimensional Tokenizer (TA-TiTok), an efficient and powerful image tokenizer that can utilize either discrete or continuous 1-dimensional tokens. TA-TiTok uniquely integrates textual information during the tokenizer decoding stage (i.e., de-tokenization), accelerating convergence and enhancing performance. TA-TiTok also benefits from a simplified, yet effective, one-stage training process, eliminating the need for the complex two-stage distillation used in previous 1-dimensional tokenizers. This design allows for seamless scalability to large datasets. Building on this, we introduce a family of text-to-image Masked Generative Models (MaskGen), trained exclusively on open data while achieving comparable performance to models trained on private data. We aim to release both the efficient, strong TA-TiTok tokenizers and the open-data, open-weight MaskGen models to promote broader access and democratize the field of text-to-image masked generative models.

Abstract: Even though an Under-Display Camera (UDC) is an advanced imaging system, the display panel significantly degrades captured images or videos, introducing low transmittance, blur, noise, and flare issues. Tackling such issues is challenging because of the complex degradation of UDCs, including diverse flare patterns. However, no dataset contains videos of real-world UDC degradation. In this paper, we propose a real-world UDC video dataset called UDC-VIT. Unlike existing datasets, UDC-VIT exclusively includes human motions for facial recognition. We propose a video-capturing system to acquire clean and UDC-degraded videos of the same scene simultaneously. Then, we align a pair of captured videos frame by frame, using discrete Fourier transform (DFT). We compare UDC-VIT with six representative UDC still image datasets and two existing UDC video datasets. Using six deep-learning models, we compare UDC-VIT and an existing synthetic UDC video dataset. The results indicate the ineffectiveness of models trained on earlier synthetic UDC video datasets, as they do not reflect the actual characteristics of UDC-degraded videos. We also demonstrate the importance of effective UDC restoration by evaluating face recognition accuracy concerning PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores. UDC-VIT is available at our official GitHub repository.

Abstract: Generating full-body human gestures based on speech signals remains challenges on quality and speed. Existing approaches model different body regions such as body, legs and hands separately, which fail to capture the spatial interactions between them and result in unnatural and disjointed movements. Additionally, their autoregressive/diffusion-based pipelines show slow generation speed due to dozens of inference steps. To address these two challenges, we propose GestureLSM, a flow-matching-based approach for Co-Speech Gesture Generation with spatial-temporal modeling. Our method i) explicitly model the interaction of tokenized body regions through spatial and temporal attention, for generating coherent full-body gestures. ii) introduce the flow matching to enable more efficient sampling by explicitly modeling the latent velocity space. To overcome the suboptimal performance of flow matching baseline, we propose latent shortcut learning and beta distribution time stamp sampling during training to enhance gesture synthesis quality and accelerate inference. Combining the spatial-temporal modeling and improved flow matching-based framework, GestureLSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on BEAT2 while significantly reducing inference time compared to existing methods, highlighting its potential for enhancing digital humans and embodied agents in real-world applications.

Abstract: Human motion video generation has advanced significantly, while existing methods still struggle with accurately rendering detailed body parts like hands and faces, especially in long sequences and intricate motions. Current approaches also rely on fixed resolution and struggle to maintain visual consistency. To address these limitations, we propose HumanDiT, a pose-guided Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework trained on a large and wild dataset containing 14,000 hours of high-quality video to produce high-fidelity videos with fine-grained body rendering. Specifically, (i) HumanDiT, built on DiT, supports numerous video resolutions and variable sequence lengths, facilitating learning for long-sequence video generation; (ii) we introduce a prefix-latent reference strategy to maintain personalized characteristics across extended sequences. Furthermore, during inference, HumanDiT leverages Keypoint-DiT to generate subsequent pose sequences, facilitating video continuation from static images or existing videos. It also utilizes a Pose Adapter to enable pose transfer with given sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance in generating long-form, pose-accurate videos across diverse scenarios.

In this work, we propose AutoOcc, a vision-centric automated pipeline for open-ended semantic occupancy annotation that integrates differentiable Gaussian splatting guided by vision-language models. We formulate the open-ended semantic 3D occupancy reconstruction task to automatically generate scene occupancy by combining attention maps from vision-language models and foundation vision models. We devise semantic-aware Gaussians as intermediate geometric descriptors and propose a cumulative Gaussian-to-voxel splatting algorithm that enables effective and efficient occupancy annotation. Our framework outperforms existing automated occupancy annotation methods without human labels. AutoOcc also enables open-ended semantic occupancy auto-labeling, achieving robust performance in both static and dynamically complex scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative AI have made text-guided image inpainting - adding, removing, or altering image regions using textual prompts - widely accessible. However, generating semantically correct photorealistic imagery, typically requires carefully-crafted prompts and iterative refinement by evaluating the realism of the generated content - tasks commonly performed by humans. To automate the generative process, we propose Semantically Aligned and Uncertainty Guided AI Image Inpainting (SAGI), a model-agnostic pipeline, to sample prompts from a distribution that closely aligns with human perception and to evaluate the generated content and discard instances that deviate from such a distribution, which we approximate using pretrained large language models and vision-language models. By applying this pipeline on multiple state-of-the-art inpainting models, we create the SAGI Dataset (SAGI-D), currently the largest and most diverse dataset of AI-generated inpaintings, comprising over 95k inpainted images and a human-evaluated subset. Our experiments show that semantic alignment significantly improves image quality and aesthetics, while uncertainty guidance effectively identifies realistic manipulations - human ability to distinguish inpainted images from real ones drops from 74% to 35% in terms of accuracy, after applying our pipeline. Moreover, using SAGI-D for training several image forensic approaches increases in-domain detection performance on average by 37.4% and out-of-domain generalization by 26.1% in terms of IoU, also demonstrating its utility in countering malicious exploitation of generative AI.

Abstract: We present a unified and generalizable framework for synthesizing view-consistent and temporally coherent avatars from a single image, addressing the challenging task of single-image avatar generation. Existing diffusion-based methods often condition on sparse human templates (e.g., depth or normal maps), which leads to multi-view and temporal inconsistencies due to the mismatch between these signals and the true appearance of the subject. Our approach bridges this gap by combining the reconstruction power of regression-based 3D human reconstruction with the generative capabilities of a diffusion model. In a first step, an initial 3D reconstructed human through a generalized NeRF provides comprehensive conditioning, ensuring high-quality synthesis faithful to the reference appearance and structure. Subsequently, the derived geometry and appearance from the generalized NeRF serve as input to a video-based diffusion model. This strategic integration is pivotal for enforcing both multi-view and temporal consistency throughout the avatar's generation. Empirical results underscore the superior generalization ability of our proposed method, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse in-domain and out-of-domain in-the-wild datasets.

Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation is crucial for creating lifelike avatars and enhancing human-computer interactions by synchronizing gestures with speech. Despite recent advancements, existing methods struggle with accurately identifying the rhythmic or semantic triggers from audio for generating contextualized gesture patterns and achieving pixel-level realism. To address these challenges, we introduce Contextual Gesture, a framework that improves co-speech gesture video generation through three innovative components: (1) a chronological speech-gesture alignment that temporally connects two modalities, (2) a contextualized gesture tokenization that incorporate speech context into motion pattern representation through distillation, and (3) a structure-aware refinement module that employs edge connection to link gesture keypoints to improve video generation. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Contextual Gesture not only produces realistic and speech-aligned gesture videos but also supports long-sequence generation and video gesture editing applications, shown in Fig.1.

Abstract: Neural synchrony is hypothesized to play a crucial role in how the brain organizes visual scenes into structured representations, enabling the robust encoding of multiple objects within a scene. However, current deep learning models often struggle with object binding, limiting their ability to represent multiple objects effectively. Inspired by neuroscience, we investigate whether synchrony-based mechanisms can enhance object encoding in artificial models trained for visual categorization. Specifically, we combine complex-valued representations with Kuramoto dynamics to promote phase alignment, facilitating the grouping of features belonging to the same object. We evaluate two architectures employing synchrony: a feedforward model and a recurrent model with feedback connections to refine phase synchronization using top-down information. Both models outperform their real-valued counterparts and complex-valued models without Kuramoto synchronization on tasks involving multi-object images, such as overlapping handwritten digits, noisy inputs, and out-of-distribution transformations. Our findings highlight the potential of synchrony-driven mechanisms to enhance deep learning models, improving their performance, robustness, and generalization in complex visual categorization tasks.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) measures gene expression at fine-grained spatial resolution, offering insights into tissue molecular landscapes. Previous methods for spatial gene expression prediction typically crop spots of interest from histopathology slide images, and train models to map each spot to a corresponding gene expression profile. However, these methods inherently lose the spatial resolution in gene expression: 1) each spot often contains multiple cells with distinct gene expression profiles; 2) spots are typically defined at fixed spatial resolutions, limiting the ability to predict gene expression at varying scales. To address these limitations, this paper presents PixNet, a dense prediction network capable of predicting spatially resolved gene expression across spots of varying sizes and scales directly from histopathology slide images. Different from previous methods that map individual spots to gene expression values, we generate a spatially dense continuous gene expression map from the histopathology slide image, and aggregate values within spots of interest to predict the gene expression. Our PixNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four common ST datasets in multiple spatial scales. The source code will be publicly available.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Infrared Small-Target Detection (IRSTD) algorithms on edge devices necessitates the exploration of model compression techniques. Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are distinguished by their exceptional efficiency in model compression. However, the small size of infrared targets introduces stringent precision requirements for the IRSTD task, while the inherent precision loss during binarization presents a significant challenge. To address this, we propose the Binarized Infrared Small-Target Detection Network (BiisNet), which preserves the core operations of binarized convolutions while integrating full-precision features into the network's information flow. Specifically, we propose the Dot Binary Convolution, which retains fine-grained semantic information in feature maps while still leveraging the binarized convolution operations. In addition, we introduce a smooth and adaptive Dynamic Softsign function, which provides more comprehensive and progressively finer gradient during backpropagation, enhancing model stability and promoting an optimal weight distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that BiisNet not only significantly outperforms other binary architectures but also has strong competitiveness among state-of-the-art full-precision models.

Abstract: Accurate geometric reconstruction of deformable tissues in monocular endoscopic video remains a fundamental challenge in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. Although recent volumetric and point primitive methods based on neural radiance fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian primitives have efficiently rendered surgical scenes, they still struggle with handling artifact-free tool occlusions and preserving fine anatomical details. These limitations stem from unrestricted Gaussian scaling and insufficient surface alignment constraints during reconstruction. To address these issues, we introduce Surgical Gaussian Surfels (SGS), which transform anisotropic point primitives into surface-aligned elliptical splats by constraining the scale component of the Gaussian covariance matrix along the view-aligned axis. We also introduce the Fully Fused Deformation Multilayer Perceptron (FFD-MLP), a lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) that predicts accurate surfel motion fields up to 5x faster than a standard MLP. This is coupled with locality constraints to handle complex tissue deformations. We use homodirectional view-space positional gradients to capture fine image details by splitting Gaussian Surfels in over-reconstructed regions. In addition, we define surface normals as the direction of the steepest density change within each Gaussian surfel primitive, enabling accurate normal estimation without requiring monocular normal priors. We evaluate our method on two in-vivo surgical datasets, where it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in surface geometry, normal map quality, and rendering efficiency, while remaining competitive in real-time rendering performance. We make our code available at https://github.com/aloma85/SurgicalGaussianSurfels

Abstract: Weakly supervised monocular 3D detection, while less annotation-intensive, often struggles to capture the global context required for reliable 3D reasoning. Conventional label-efficient methods focus on object-centric features, neglecting contextual semantic relationships that are critical in complex scenes. In this work, we propose a Context-Aware Weak Supervision for Monocular 3D object detection, namely CA-W3D, to address this limitation in a two-stage training paradigm. Specifically, we first introduce a pre-training stage employing Region-wise Object Contrastive Matching (ROCM), which aligns regional object embeddings derived from a trainable monocular 3D encoder and a frozen open-vocabulary 2D visual grounding model. This alignment encourages the monocular encoder to discriminate scene-specific attributes and acquire richer contextual knowledge. In the second stage, we incorporate a pseudo-label training process with a Dual-to-One Distillation (D2OD) mechanism, which effectively transfers contextual priors into the monocular encoder while preserving spatial fidelity and maintaining computational efficiency during inference. Extensive experiments conducted on the public KITTI benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing the SoTA method over all metrics, highlighting the importance of contextual-aware knowledge in weakly-supervised monocular 3D detection.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where adversaries bypass safety mechanisms to elicit harmful outputs. In this work, we examine an insidious variant of this threat: toxic continuation. Unlike standard jailbreaks that rely solely on malicious instructions, toxic continuation arises when the model is given a malicious input alongside a partial toxic output, resulting in harmful completions. This vulnerability poses a unique challenge in multimodal settings, where even subtle image variations can disproportionately affect the model's response. To this end, we propose RedDiffuser (RedDiff), the first red teaming framework that uses reinforcement learning to fine-tune diffusion models into generating natural-looking adversarial images that induce toxic continuations. RedDiffuser integrates a greedy search procedure for selecting candidate image prompts with reinforcement fine-tuning that jointly promotes toxic output and semantic coherence. Experiments demonstrate that RedDiffuser significantly increases the toxicity rate in LLaVA outputs by 10.69% and 8.91% on the original and hold-out sets, respectively. It also exhibits strong transferability, increasing toxicity rates on Gemini by 5.1% and on LLaMA-Vision by 26.83%. These findings uncover a cross-modal toxicity amplification vulnerability in current VLM alignment, highlighting the need for robust multimodal red teaming. We will release the RedDiffuser codebase to support future research.

Abstract: Language-guided 3D scene understanding is important for advancing applications in robotics, AR/VR, and human-computer interaction, enabling models to comprehend and interact with 3D environments through natural language. While 2D vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in 2D VQA tasks, progress in the 3D domain has been significantly slower due to the complexity of 3D data and the high cost of manual annotations. In this work, we introduce SplatTalk, a novel method that uses a generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) framework to produce 3D tokens suitable for direct input into a pretrained LLM, enabling effective zero-shot 3D visual question answering (3D VQA) for scenes with only posed images. During experiments on multiple benchmarks, our approach outperforms both 3D models trained specifically for the task and previous 2D-LMM-based models utilizing only images (our setting), while achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art 3D LMMs that additionally utilize 3D inputs.

Abstract: Generating coherent long-form video sequences from discrete input using only text prompts is a critical task in content creation. While diffusion-based models excel at short video synthesis, long-form storytelling from text remains largely unexplored and a challenge due to challenges pertaining to temporal coherency, preserving semantic meaning and action continuity across the video. We introduce a novel AI-empowered storytelling framework to enable seamless video generation with natural action transitions and structured narratives. We first present a bidirectional time-weighted latent blending strategy to ensure temporal consistency between segments of the long-form video being generated. We then introduce a dynamics-informed prompt weighting (DIPW) mechanism that adaptively adjusts the influence of scene and action prompts at each diffusion timestep by jointly considering CLIP-based alignment, narrative continuity, and temporal smoothness. To further enhance motion continuity, we propose a semantic action representation to encode high-level action semantics into the blending process, dynamically adjusting transitions based on action similarity, ensuring smooth yet adaptable motion changes. Latent space blending maintains spatial coherence between objects in a scene, while time-weighted blending enforces bidirectional constraints for temporal consistency. The resulting integrative system prevents abrupt transitions while ensuring fluid storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baselines, achieving temporally consistent and visually compelling video narratives without any additional training. This approach bridges the gap between short clips and extended video to establish a new paradigm in GenAI-driven video synthesis from text.

Abstract: Adversarial training significantly enhances adversarial robustness, yet superior performance is predominantly achieved on balanced datasets. Addressing adversarial robustness in the context of unbalanced or long-tailed distributions is considerably more challenging, mainly due to the scarcity of tail data instances. Previous research on adversarial robustness within long-tailed distributions has primarily focused on combining traditional long-tailed natural training with existing adversarial robustness methods.In this study, we provide an in-depth analysis for the challenge that adversarial training struggles to achieve high performance on tail classes in long-tailed distributions. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective solution to advance adversarial robustness on long-tailed distributions through a novel self-distillation technique. Specifically, this approach leverages a balanced self-teacher model, which is trained using a balanced dataset sampled from the original long-tailed dataset. Our extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both clean and robust accuracy for long-tailed adversarial robustness, with significant improvements in tail class performance on various datasets. We improve the accuracy against PGD attacks for tail classes by 20.3, 7.1, and 3.8 percentage points on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively, while achieving the highest robust accuracy.

<title>SSVQ: Unleashing the Potential of Vector Quantization with Sign-Splitting</title>

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) has emerged as a prominent weight compression technique, showcasing substantially lower quantization errors than uniform quantization across diverse models, particularly in extreme compression scenarios. However, its efficacy during fine-tuning is limited by the constraint of the compression format, where weight vectors assigned to the same codeword are restricted to updates in the same direction. Consequently, many quantized weights are compelled to move in directions contrary to their local gradient information. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a novel VQ paradigm, Sign-Splitting VQ (SSVQ), which decouples the sign bit of weights from the codebook. Our approach involves extracting the sign bits of uncompressed weights and performing clustering and compression on all-positive weights. We then introduce latent variables for the sign bit and jointly optimize both the signs and the codebook. Additionally, we implement a progressive freezing strategy for the learnable sign to ensure training stability. Extensive experiments on various modern models and tasks demonstrate that SSVQ achieves a significantly superior compression-accuracy trade-off compared to conventional VQ. Furthermore, we validate our algorithm on a hardware accelerator, showing that SSVQ achieves a 3$\times$ speedup over the 8-bit compressed model by reducing memory access. Our code is available at https://github.com/list0830/SSVQ.

Abstract: Conventional production workflow of high-precision mesh assets necessitates a cumbersome and laborious process of manual sculpting by specialized 3D artists/modelers. The recent years have witnessed remarkable advances in AI-empowered 3D content creation for generating plausible structures and intricate appearances from images or text prompts. However, synthesizing realistic surface details still poses great challenges, and enhancing the geometry fidelity of existing lower-quality 3D meshes (instead of image/text-to-3D generation) remains an open problem. In this paper, we introduce SuperCarver, a 3D geometry super-resolution pipeline for supplementing texture-consistent surface details onto a given coarse mesh. We start by rendering the original textured mesh into the image domain from multiple viewpoints. To achieve detail boosting, we construct a deterministic prior-guided normal diffusion model, which is fine-tuned on a carefully curated dataset of paired detail-lacking and detail-rich normal map renderings. To update mesh surfaces from potentially imperfect normal map predictions, we design a noise-resistant inverse rendering scheme through deformable distance field. Experiments demonstrate that our SuperCarver is capable of generating realistic and expressive surface details depicted by the actual texture appearance, making it a powerful tool to both upgrade historical low-quality 3D assets and reduce the workload of sculpting high-poly meshes.

Abstract: Humans can infer complete shapes and appearances of objects from limited visual cues, relying on extensive prior knowledge of the physical world. However, completing partially observable objects while ensuring consistency across video frames remains challenging for existing models, especially for unstructured, in-the-wild videos. This paper tackles the task of Video Amodal Completion (VAC), which aims to generate the complete object consistently throughout the video given a visual prompt specifying the object of interest. Leveraging the rich, consistent manifolds learned by pre-trained video diffusion models, we propose a conditional diffusion model, TACO, that repurposes these manifolds for VAC. To enable its effective and robust generalization to challenging in-the-wild scenarios, we curate a large-scale synthetic dataset with multiple difficulty levels by systematically imposing occlusions onto un-occluded videos. Building on this, we devise a progressive fine-tuning paradigm that starts with simpler recovery tasks and gradually advances to more complex ones. We demonstrate TACO's versatility on a wide range of in-the-wild videos from Internet, as well as on diverse, unseen datasets commonly used in autonomous driving, robotic manipulation, and scene understanding. Moreover, we show that TACO can be effectively applied to various downstream tasks like object reconstruction and pose estimation, highlighting its potential to facilitate physical world understanding and reasoning.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable success in medical image analysis, but its reliance on large volumes of high-quality labeled data limits its applicability. While noisy labeled data are easier to obtain, directly incorporating them into training can degrade model performance. To address this challenge, we propose a Mean Teacher-based Adaptive Label Correction (ALC) self-ensemble framework for robust medical image segmentation with noisy labels. The framework leverages the Mean Teacher architecture to ensure consistent learning under noise perturbations. It includes an adaptive label refinement mechanism that dynamically captures and weights differences across multiple disturbance versions to enhance the quality of noisy labels. Additionally, a sample-level uncertainty-based label selection algorithm is introduced to prioritize high-confidence samples for network updates, mitigating the impact of noisy annotations. Consistency learning is integrated to align the predictions of the student and teacher networks, further enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, showing significant improvements in segmentation performance. By fully exploiting the strengths of the Mean Teacher structure, the ALC framework effectively processes noisy labels, adapts to challenging scenarios, and achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: 3D task planning has attracted increasing attention in human-robot interaction and embodied AI thanks to the recent advances in multimodal learning. However, most existing studies are facing two common challenges: 1) heavy reliance on explicit instructions with little reasoning on implicit user intention; 2) negligence of inter-step route planning on robot moves. We address the above challenges by proposing 3D Reasoning-Driven Planning, a novel 3D task that reasons the intended activities from implicit instructions and decomposes them into steps with inter-step routes and planning under the guidance of fine-grained 3D object shapes and locations from scene segmentation. We tackle the new 3D task from two perspectives. First, we construct ReasonPlan3D, a large-scale benchmark that covers diverse 3D scenes with rich implicit instructions and detailed annotations for multi-step task planning, inter-step route planning, and fine-grained segmentation. Second, we design a novel framework that introduces progressive plan generation with contextual consistency across multiple steps, as well as a scene graph that is updated dynamically for capturing critical objects and their spatial relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our benchmark and framework in reasoning activities from implicit human instructions, producing accurate stepwise task plans and seamlessly integrating route planning for multi-step moves. The dataset and code will be released.

Abstract: Compact and efficient 6DoF object pose estimation is crucial in applications such as robotics, augmented reality, and space autonomous navigation systems, where lightweight models are critical for real-time accurate performance. This paper introduces a novel uncertainty-aware end-to-end Knowledge Distillation (KD) framework focused on keypoint-based 6DoF pose estimation. Keypoints predicted by a large teacher model exhibit varying levels of uncertainty that can be exploited within the distillation process to enhance the accuracy of the student model while ensuring its compactness. To this end, we propose a distillation strategy that aligns the student and teacher predictions by adjusting the knowledge transfer based on the uncertainty associated with each teacher keypoint prediction. Additionally, the proposed KD leverages this uncertainty-aware alignment of keypoints to transfer the knowledge at key locations of their respective feature maps. Experiments on the widely-used LINEMOD benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving superior 6DoF object pose estimation with lightweight models compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Further validation on the SPEED+ dataset for spacecraft pose estimation highlights the robustness of our approach under diverse 6DoF pose estimation scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g. CLIP, LLaVA) are trained on large-scale, lightly curated web datasets, leading them to learn unintended correlations between semantic concepts and unrelated visual signals. These associations degrade model accuracy by causing predictions to rely on incidental patterns rather than genuine visual understanding. Prior work has weaponized these correlations as an attack vector to manipulate model predictions, such as inserting a deceiving class text onto the image in a "typographic" attack. These attacks succeed due to VLMs' text-heavy bias-a result of captions that echo visible words rather than describing content. However, this attack has focused solely on text that matches the target class exactly, overlooking a broader range of correlations, including non-matching text and graphical symbols, which arise from the abundance of branding content in web-scale data. To address this gap, we introduce "artifact-based" attacks: a novel class of manipulations that mislead models using both non-matching text and graphical elements. Unlike typographic attacks, these artifacts are not predefined, making them simultaneously harder to defend against and more challenging to find. We address this by framing artifact attacks as a search problem and demonstrate their effectiveness across five datasets, with some artifacts reinforcing each other to reach 100% attack success rates. These attacks transfer across models with up to 90% effectiveness, making it possible to attack unseen models. To defend against these attacks, we extend prior work's artifact aware prompting to the graphical setting. We see a moderate reduction of success rates of up to 15% relative to standard prompts, suggesting a promising direction for enhancing model robustness.

Abstract: Vision-language models for Earth observation (EO) typically rely on the visual spectrum of data as the only model input, thus failing to leverage the rich spectral information available in the multispectral channels recorded by satellites. Therefore, we introduce Llama3-MS-CLIP, the first vision-language model pre-trained with contrastive learning on a large-scale multispectral dataset and report on the performance gains due to the extended spectral range. Furthermore, we present the largest-to-date image-caption dataset for multispectral data, consisting of one million Sentinel-2 samples and corresponding textual descriptions generated using Llama3-LLaVA-Next and Overture Maps data. We develop a scalable captioning pipeline, which is validated by domain experts. We evaluate Llama3-MS-CLIP on multispectral zero-shot image classification and retrieval using three datasets of varying complexity. Our results demonstrate that Llama3-MS-CLIP significantly outperforms other RGB-based approaches, improving classification accuracy by +6.77% on average and retrieval performance by +4.63% mAP compared to the second-best model. Our results emphasize the relevance of multispectral vision-language learning. The image-caption dataset, code, and model weights are available at https://github.com/IBM/MS-CLIP.

Abstract: We formulate the motor system of an interactive avatar as a generative motion model that can drive the body to move through 3D space in a perpetual, realistic, controllable, and responsive manner. Although human motion generation has been extensively studied, many existing methods lack the responsiveness and realism of real human movements. Inspired by recent advances in foundation models, we propose PRIMAL, which is learned with a two-stage paradigm. In the pretraining stage, the model learns body movements from a large number of sub-second motion segments, providing a generative foundation from which more complex motions are built. This training is fully unsupervised without annotations. Given a single-frame initial state during inference, the pretrained model not only generates unbounded, realistic, and controllable motion, but also enables the avatar to be responsive to induced impulses in real time. In the adaptation phase, we employ a novel ControlNet-like adaptor to fine-tune the base model efficiently, adapting it to new tasks such as few-shot personalized action generation and spatial target reaching. Evaluations show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We leverage the model to create a real-time character animation system in Unreal Engine that feels highly responsive and natural.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstructions are plagued by stubborn ``floater" artifacts that degrade their geometric and visual fidelity. We are the first to reveal the root cause: a fundamental conflict in the 3DGS optimization process where the opacity gradients of floaters vanish when their blended color reaches a pseudo-equilibrium of canceling errors against the background, trapping them in a spurious local minimum. To resolve this, we propose StableGS, a novel framework that decouples geometric regularization from final appearance rendering. Its core is a Dual Opacity architecture that creates two separate rendering paths: a ``Geometric Regularization Path" to bear strong depth-based constraints for structural correctness, and an ``Appearance Refinement Path" to generate high-fidelity details upon this stable foundation. We complement this with a synergistic set of geometric constraints: a self-supervised depth consistency loss and an external geometric prior enabled by our efficient global scale optimization algorithm. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show StableGS not only eliminates floaters but also resolves the common blur-artifact trade-off, achieving state-of-the-art geometric accuracy and visual quality.

Abstract: Sketch animation, which brings static sketches to life by generating dynamic video sequences, has found widespread applications in GIF design, cartoon production, and daily entertainment. While current methods for sketch animation perform well in single-object sketch animation, they struggle in multi-object scenarios. By analyzing their failures, we identify two major challenges of transitioning from single-object to multi-object sketch animation: object-aware motion modeling and complex motion optimization. For multi-object sketch animation, we propose MoSketch based on iterative optimization through Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) and thus animating a multi-object sketch in a training-data free manner. To tackle the two challenges in a divide-and-conquer strategy, MoSketch has four novel modules, i.e., LLM-based scene decomposition, LLM-based motion planning, multi-grained motion refinement, and compositional SDS. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing sketch animation approaches. MoSketch takes a pioneering step towards multi-object sketch animation, opening new avenues for future research and applications.

Abstract: Traditional open-access datasets focusing on surgical procedures are often limited by their small size, typically consisting of fewer than 100 videos and less than 30 hours of footage, which leads to poor model generalization. To address this constraint, a new dataset called LEMON has been compiled using a novel aggregation pipeline that collects high-resolution videos from online sources. Featuring an extensive collection of over 4K surgical videos totaling 938 hours (85 million frames) of high-quality footage across multiple procedure types, LEMON offers a comprehensive resource surpassing existing alternatives in size and scope, including two novel downstream tasks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this diverse dataset, we introduce LemonFM, a foundation model pretrained on LEMON using a novel self-supervised augmented knowledge distillation approach. LemonFM consistently outperforms existing surgical foundation models across four downstream tasks and six datasets, achieving significant gains in surgical phase recognition (+9.5pp, +9.4pp, and +8.4pp of Jaccard in AutoLaparo, M2CAI16, and Cholec80), surgical action recognition (+4.4pp of mAP in CholecT50), surgical tool presence detection (+5.3pp and +10.2pp of mAP in Cholec80 and GraSP), and surgical semantic segmentation (+8.3pp of mDice in CholecSeg8k). LEMON and LemonFM will serve as foundational resources for the research community and industry, accelerating progress in developing autonomous robotic surgery systems and ultimately contributing to safer and more accessible surgical care worldwide.

<title>Scaling Vision Pre-Training to 4K Resolution</title>

Abstract: High-resolution perception of visual details is crucial for daily tasks. Current vision pre-training, however, is still limited to low resolutions (e.g., 378 x 378 pixels) due to the quadratic cost of processing larger images. We introduce PS3 that scales CLIP-style vision pre-training to 4K resolution with a near-constant cost. Instead of contrastive learning on global image representation, PS3 is pre-trained by selectively processing local regions and contrasting them with local detailed captions, enabling high-resolution representation learning with greatly reduced computational overhead. The pre-trained PS3 is able to both encode the global image at low resolution and selectively process local high-resolution regions based on their saliency or relevance to a text prompt. When applying PS3 to multi-modal LLM (MLLM), the resulting model, named VILA-HD, significantly improves high-resolution visual perception compared to baselines without high-resolution vision pre-training such as AnyRes and S^2 while using up to 4.3x fewer tokens. PS3 also unlocks appealing scaling properties of VILA-HD, including scaling up resolution for free and scaling up test-time compute for better performance. Compared to state of the arts, PS3 and VILA-HD outperform previous vision encoders (e.g., SigLIP2 and Perception Encoder) and MLLMs (e.g., NVILA and Qwen2.5-VL) respectively across multiple benchmarks and achieve better efficiency than latest token pruning approaches. Finally, we find current benchmarks do not require 4K-resolution perception, which motivates us to propose 4KPro, a new benchmark of image QA at 4K resolution, on which VILA-HD outperforms all previous MLLMs, including a 16.1% improvement over GPT-4o and a 7.5% improvement and 1.67x speedup over Qwen2.5-VL.

Abstract: The differences between images belonging to fine-grained categories are often subtle and highly localized, and existing explainability techniques for deep learning models are often too diffuse to provide useful and interpretable explanations. We propose a new explainability method (PAIR-X) that leverages both intermediate model activations and backpropagated relevance scores to generate fine-grained, highly-localized pairwise visual explanations. We use animal and building re-identification (re-ID) as a primary case study of our method, and we demonstrate qualitatively improved results over a diverse set of explainability baselines on 35 public re-ID datasets. In interviews, animal re-ID experts found PAIR-X to be a meaningful improvement over existing baselines for deep model explainability, and suggested that its visualizations would be directly applicable to their work. We also propose a novel quantitative evaluation metric for our method, and demonstrate that PAIR-X visualizations appear more plausible for correct image matches than incorrect ones even when the model similarity score for the pairs is the same. By improving interpretability, PAIR-X enables humans to better distinguish correct and incorrect matches. Our code is available at: https://github.com/pairx-explains/pairx

<title>Safeguarding Vision-Language Models: Mitigating Vulnerabilities to Gaussian Noise in Perturbation-based Attacks</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) extend the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by incorporating visual information, yet they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, especially when processing noisy or corrupted images. Although existing VLMs adopt security measures during training to mitigate such attacks, vulnerabilities associated with noise-augmented visual inputs are overlooked. In this work, we identify that missing noise-augmented training causes critical security gaps: many VLMs are susceptible to even simple perturbations such as Gaussian noise. To address this challenge, we propose Robust-VLGuard, a multimodal safety dataset with aligned / misaligned image-text pairs, combined with noise-augmented fine-tuning that reduces attack success rates while preserving functionality of VLM. For stronger optimization-based visual perturbation attacks, we propose DiffPure-VLM, leveraging diffusion models to convert adversarial perturbations into Gaussian-like noise, which can be defended by VLMs with noise-augmented safety fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the distribution-shifting property of diffusion model aligns well with our fine-tuned VLMs, significantly mitigating adversarial perturbations across varying intensities. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/JarvisUSTC/DiffPure-RobustVLM.

<title>Efficient Autoregressive Shape Generation via Octree-Based Adaptive Tokenization</title>

Abstract: Many 3D generative models rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to learn compact shape representations. However, existing methods encode all shapes into a fixed-size token, disregarding the inherent variations in scale and complexity across 3D data. This leads to inefficient latent representations that can compromise downstream generation. We address this challenge by introducing Octree-based Adaptive Tokenization, a novel framework that adjusts the dimension of latent representations according to shape complexity. Our approach constructs an adaptive octree structure guided by a quadric-error-based subdivision criterion and allocates a shape latent vector to each octree cell using a query-based transformer. Building upon this tokenization, we develop an octree-based autoregressive generative model that effectively leverages these variable-sized representations in shape generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces token counts by 50% compared to fixed-size methods while maintaining comparable visual quality. When using a similar token length, our method produces significantly higher-quality shapes. When incorporated with our downstream generative model, our method creates more detailed and diverse 3D content than existing approaches.

Abstract: Building general-purpose models that can effectively perceive the world through multimodal signals has been a long-standing goal. Current approaches involve integrating separately pre-trained components, such as connecting vision encoders to LLMs and continuing multimodal training. While such approaches exhibit remarkable sample efficiency, it remains an open question whether such late-fusion architectures are inherently superior. In this work, we revisit the architectural design of native multimodal models (NMMs)-those trained from the ground up on all modalities-and conduct an extensive scaling laws study, spanning 457 trained models with different architectures and training mixtures. Our investigation reveals no inherent advantage to late-fusion architectures over early-fusion ones, which do not rely on image encoders or tokenizers. On the contrary, early-fusion exhibits stronger performance at lower parameter counts, is more efficient to train, and is easier to deploy. Motivated by the strong performance of the early-fusion architectures, we show that incorporating Mixture of Experts (MoEs) allows models to learn modality-specific weights, significantly benefiting performance.

<title>LayoutCoT: Unleashing the Deep Reasoning Potential of Large Language Models for Layout Generation</title>

Abstract: Conditional layout generation aims to automatically generate visually appealing and semantically coherent layouts from user-defined constraints. While recent methods based on generative models have shown promising results, they typically require substantial amounts of training data or extensive fine-tuning, limiting their versatility and practical applicability. Alternatively, some training-free approaches leveraging in-context learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged, but they often suffer from limited reasoning capabilities and overly simplistic ranking mechanisms, which restrict their ability to generate consistently high-quality layouts. To this end, we propose LayoutCoT, a novel approach that leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs through a combination of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. Specifically, LayoutCoT transforms layout representations into a standardized serialized format suitable for processing by LLMs. A Layout-aware RAG is used to facilitate effective retrieval and generate a coarse layout by LLMs. This preliminary layout, together with the selected exemplars, is then fed into a specially designed CoT reasoning module for iterative refinement, significantly enhancing both semantic coherence and visual quality. We conduct extensive experiments on five public datasets spanning three conditional layout generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that LayoutCoT achieves state-of-the-art performance without requiring training or fine-tuning. Notably, our CoT reasoning module enables standard LLMs, even those without explicit deep reasoning abilities, to outperform specialized deep-reasoning models such as deepseek-R1, highlighting the potential of our approach in unleashing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs for layout generation tasks.

Abstract: Reconstructing transparent surfaces is essential for tasks such as robotic manipulation in labs, yet it poses a significant challenge for 3D reconstruction techniques like 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). These methods often encounter a transparency-depth dilemma, where the pursuit of photorealistic rendering through standard $\alpha$-blending undermines geometric precision, resulting in considerable depth estimation errors for transparent materials. To address this issue, we introduce Transparent Surface Gaussian Splatting (TSGS), a new framework that separates geometry learning from appearance refinement. In the geometry learning stage, TSGS focuses on geometry by using specular-suppressed inputs to accurately represent surfaces. In the second stage, TSGS improves visual fidelity through anisotropic specular modeling, crucially maintaining the established opacity to ensure geometric accuracy. To enhance depth inference, TSGS employs a first-surface depth extraction method. This technique uses a sliding window over $\alpha$-blending weights to pinpoint the most likely surface location and calculates a robust weighted average depth. To evaluate the transparent surface reconstruction task under realistic conditions, we collect a TransLab dataset that includes complex transparent laboratory glassware. Extensive experiments on TransLab show that TSGS achieves accurate geometric reconstruction and realistic rendering of transparent objects simultaneously within the efficient 3DGS framework. Specifically, TSGS significantly surpasses current leading methods, achieving a 37.3% reduction in chamfer distance and an 8.0% improvement in F1 score compared to the top baseline. The code and dataset are available at https://longxiang-ai.github.io/TSGS/.

<title>MathPhys-Guided Coarse-to-Fine Anomaly Synthesis with SQE-Driven Bi-Level Optimization for Anomaly Detection</title>

Abstract: Currently, industrial anomaly detection suffers from two bottlenecks: (i) the rarity of real-world defect images and (ii) the opacity of sample quality when synthetic data are used. Existing synthetic strategies (e.g., cut-and-paste) overlook the underlying physical causes of defects, leading to inconsistent, low-fidelity anomalies that hamper model generalization to real-world complexities. In this paper, we introduce a novel and lightweight pipeline that generates synthetic anomalies through Math-Phys model guidance, refines them via a Coarse-to-Fine approach and employs a bi-level optimization strategy with a Synthesis Quality Estimator (SQE). By combining physical modeling of the three most typical physics-driven defect mechanisms: Fracture Line (FL), Pitting Loss (PL), and Plastic Warpage (PW), our method produces realistic defect masks, which are subsequently enhanced in two phases. The first stage (npcF) enforces a PDE-based consistency to achieve a globally coherent anomaly structure, while the second stage (npcF++) further improves local fidelity. Additionally, we leverage SQE-driven weighting, ensuring that high-quality synthetic samples receive greater emphasis during training. To validate our method, we conduct experiments on three anomaly detection benchmarks: MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD. Across these datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results in both image- and pixel-AUROC, confirming the effectiveness of our MaPhC2F dataset and BiSQAD method. All code will be released.

Abstract: Efficiently transferring Learned Image Compression (LIC) model from human perception to machine perception is an emerging challenge in vision-centric representation learning. Existing approaches typically adapt LIC to downstream tasks in a single-task manner, which is inefficient, lacks task interaction, and results in multiple task-specific bitstreams. In this paper, we propose a multi-task adaptation framework that enables transferring a pre-trained base codec to multiple machine vision tasks through a unified model and a single training process. To achieve this, we design an asymmetric adaptation architecture consisting of a task-agnostic encoder adaptation and task-specific decoder adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce two feature propagation modules to facilitate inter-task and inter-scale feature represenation learning. Experiments on PASCAL-Context and NYUD-V2 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms both Fully Fine-Tuned and other Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuned (PEFT) baselines. Code will be released.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion models, achieving reliable image generation and editing remains challenging due to the inherent diversity induced by stochastic noise in the sampling process. Instruction-guided image editing with diffusion models offers user-friendly capabilities, yet editing failures, such as background distortion, frequently occur. Users often resort to trial and error, adjusting seeds or prompts to achieve satisfactory results, which is inefficient. While seed selection methods exist for Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, they depend on external verifiers, limiting applicability, and evaluating multiple seeds increases computational complexity. To address this, we first establish a multiple-seed-based image editing baseline using background consistency scores, achieving Best-of-N performance without supervision. Building on this, we introduce ELECT (Early-timestep Latent Evaluation for Candidate Selection), a zero-shot framework that selects reliable seeds by estimating background mismatches at early diffusion timesteps, identifying the seed that retains the background while modifying only the foreground. ELECT ranks seed candidates by a background inconsistency score, filtering unsuitable samples early based on background consistency while preserving editability. Beyond standalone seed selection, ELECT integrates into instruction-guided editing pipelines and extends to Multimodal Large-Language Models (MLLMs) for joint seed and prompt selection, further improving results when seed selection alone is insufficient. Experiments show that ELECT reduces computational costs (by 41 percent on average and up to 61 percent) while improving background consistency and instruction adherence, achieving around 40 percent success rates in previously failed cases - without any external supervision or training.

Abstract: Personalized image generation has emerged as a promising direction in multimodal content creation. It aims to synthesize images tailored to individual style preferences (e.g., color schemes, character appearances, layout) and semantic intentions (e.g., emotion, action, scene contexts) by leveraging user-interacted history images and multimodal instructions. Despite notable progress, existing methods -- whether based on diffusion models, large language models, or Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) -- struggle to accurately capture and fuse user style preferences and semantic intentions. In particular, the state-of-the-art LMM-based method suffers from the entanglement of visual features, leading to Guidance Collapse, where the generated images fail to preserve user-preferred styles or reflect the specified semantics.
  To address these limitations, we introduce DRC, a novel personalized image generation framework that enhances LMMs through Disentangled Representation Composition. DRC explicitly extracts user style preferences and semantic intentions from history images and the reference image, respectively, to form user-specific latent instructions that guide image generation within LMMs. Specifically, it involves two critical learning stages: 1) Disentanglement learning, which employs a dual-tower disentangler to explicitly separate style and semantic features, optimized via a reconstruction-driven paradigm with difficulty-aware importance sampling; and 2) Personalized modeling, which applies semantic-preserving augmentations to effectively adapt the disentangled representations for robust personalized generation. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that DRC shows competitive performance while effectively mitigating the guidance collapse issue, underscoring the importance of disentangled representation learning for controllable and effective personalized image generation.

Abstract: Audiovisual emotion recognition (AVER) aims to infer human emotions from nonverbal visual-audio (VA) cues, offering modality-complementary and language-agnostic advantages. However, AVER remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of emotional expressions, cross-modal expressive disparities, and the scarcity of reliably annotated data. Recent self-supervised AVER approaches have introduced strong multimodal representations, yet they predominantly rely on modality-specific encoders and coarse content-level alignment, limiting fine-grained emotional semantic modeling. To address these issues, we propose VAEmo, an efficient two-stage framework for emotion-centric joint VA representation learning with external knowledge injection. In Stage~1, a unified and lightweight representation network is pre-trained on large-scale speaker-centric VA corpora via masked reconstruction and contrastive objectives, mitigating the modality gap and learning expressive, complementary representations without emotion labels. In Stage~2, multimodal large language models automatically generate detailed affective descriptions according to our well-designed chain-of-thought prompting for only a small subset of VA samples; these rich textual semantics are then injected by aligning their corresponding embeddings with VA representations through dual-path contrastive learning, further bridging the emotion gap. Extensive experiments on multiple downstream AVER benchmarks show that VAEmo achieves state-of-the-art performance with a compact design, highlighting the benefit of unified cross-modal encoding and emotion-aware semantic guidance for efficient, generalizable VA emotion representations.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative models-particularly diffusion models and rectified flows-have revolutionized visual content creation, yet aligning model outputs with human preferences remains a critical challenge. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods for visual generation face critical limitations: incompatibility with modern Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)-based sampling paradigms, instability in large-scale training, and lack of validation for video generation. This paper introduces DanceGRPO, the first unified framework to adapt Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to visual generation paradigms, unleashing one unified RL algorithm across two generative paradigms (diffusion models and rectified flows), three tasks (text-to-image, text-to-video, image-to-video), four foundation models (Stable Diffusion, HunyuanVideo, FLUX, SkyReels-I2V), and five reward models (image/video aesthetics, text-image alignment, video motion quality, and binary reward). To our knowledge, DanceGRPO is the first RL-based unified framework capable of seamless adaptation across diverse generative paradigms, tasks, foundational models, and reward models. DanceGRPO demonstrates consistent and substantial improvements, which outperform baselines by up to 181% on benchmarks such as HPS-v2.1, CLIP Score, VideoAlign, and GenEval. Notably, DanceGRPO not only can stabilize policy optimization for complex video generation, but also enables generative policy to better capture denoising trajectories for Best-of-N inference scaling and learn from sparse binary feedback. Our results establish DanceGRPO as a robust and versatile solution for scaling Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) tasks in visual generation, offering new insights into harmonizing reinforcement learning and visual synthesis. The code will be released.

Abstract: Compact models can be effectively trained through Knowledge Distillation (KD), a technique that transfers knowledge from larger, high-performing teacher models. Two key challenges in Knowledge Distillation (KD) are: 1) balancing learning from the teacher's guidance and the task objective, and 2) handling the disparity in knowledge representation between teacher and student models. To address these, we propose Multi-Task Optimization for Knowledge Distillation (MoKD). MoKD tackles two main gradient issues: a) Gradient Conflicts, where task-specific and distillation gradients are misaligned, and b) Gradient Dominance, where one objective's gradient dominates, causing imbalance. MoKD reformulates KD as a multi-objective optimization problem, enabling better balance between objectives. Additionally, it introduces a subspace learning framework to project feature representations into a high-dimensional space, improving knowledge transfer. Our MoKD is demonstrated to outperform existing methods through extensive experiments on image classification using the ImageNet-1K dataset and object detection using the COCO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance with greater efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, MoKD models also achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to models trained from scratch.

Abstract: System2 reasoning is developing rapidly these days with the emergence of Deep- Thinking Models and chain-of-thought technology, which has become a centralized discussion point in the AI community. However, there is a relative gap in the research on complex video reasoning at present. In this work, we propose CoT-Vid, a novel training-free paradigm for the video domain with a multistage complex reasoning design. Distinguishing from existing video LLMs, which rely heavily on perceptual abilities, it achieved surprising performance gain with explicit reasoning mechanism. The paradigm consists of three main components: dynamic inference path routing, problem decoupling strategy, and video self-consistency verification. In addition, we propose a new standard for categorization of video questions. CoT- Vid showed outstanding results on a wide range of benchmarks, and outperforms its base model by 9.3% on Egochema and 5.6% on VideoEspresso, rivalling or even surpassing larger and proprietary models, such as GPT-4V, GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-flash. Our codebase will be publicly available soon.

Abstract: Scaling video diffusion transformers (DiTs) is limited by their quadratic 3D attention, even though most of the attention mass concentrates on a small subset of positions. We turn this observation into VSA, a trainable, hardware-efficient sparse attention that replaces full attention at \emph{both} training and inference. In VSA, a lightweight coarse stage pools tokens into tiles and identifies high-weight \emph{critical tokens}; a fine stage computes token-level attention only inside those tiles subjecting to block computing layout to ensure hard efficiency. This leads to a single differentiable kernel that trains end-to-end, requires no post-hoc profiling, and sustains 85\% of FlashAttention3 MFU. We perform a large sweep of ablation studies and scaling-law experiments by pretraining DiTs from 60M to 1.4B parameters. VSA reaches a Pareto point that cuts training FLOPS by 2.53$\times$ with no drop in diffusion loss. Retrofitting the open-source Wan-2.1 model speeds up attention time by 6$\times$ and lowers end-to-end generation time from 31s to 18s with comparable quality. These results establish trainable sparse attention as a practical alternative to full attention and a key enabler for further scaling of video diffusion models. Code will be available at https://github.com/hao-ai-lab/FastVideo.

Abstract: With recent breakthroughs in large-scale modeling, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated significant potential in a variety of visual applications. However, due to the lack of underwater domain expertise, SAM and its variants face performance limitations in end-to-end underwater instance segmentation tasks, while their higher computational requirements further hinder their application in underwater scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a large-scale underwater instance segmentation dataset, UIIS10K, which includes 10,048 images with pixel-level annotations for 10 categories. Then, we introduce UWSAM, an efficient model designed for automatic and accurate segmentation of underwater instances. UWSAM efficiently distills knowledge from the SAM ViT-Huge image encoder into the smaller ViT-Small image encoder via the Mask GAT-based Underwater Knowledge Distillation (MG-UKD) method for effective visual representation learning. Furthermore, we design an End-to-end Underwater Prompt Generator (EUPG) for UWSAM, which automatically generates underwater prompts instead of explicitly providing foreground points or boxes as prompts, thus enabling the network to locate underwater instances accurately for efficient segmentation. Comprehensive experimental results show that our model is effective, achieving significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on multiple underwater instance datasets. Datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/LiamLian0727/UIIS10K.

Abstract: Recent advances in scene-based video generation have enabled systems to synthesize coherent visual narratives from structured prompts. However, a crucial dimension of storytelling -- character-driven dialogue and speech -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a modular pipeline that transforms action-level prompts into visually and auditorily grounded narrative dialogue, enriching visual storytelling with natural voice and character expression. Our method takes as input a pair of prompts per scene, where the first defines the setting and the second specifies a character's behavior. While a story generation model such as Text2Story produces the corresponding visual scene, we focus on generating expressive, character-consistent utterances grounded in both the prompts and the scene image. A pretrained vision-language encoder extracts high-level semantic features from a representative frame, capturing salient visual context. These features are then integrated with structured prompts to guide a large language model in synthesizing natural dialogue. To ensure contextual and emotional consistency across scenes, we introduce a Recursive Narrative Bank -- a speaker-aware, temporally structured memory that recursively accumulates each character's dialogue history. Inspired by Script Theory in cognitive psychology, this design enables characters to speak in ways that reflect their evolving goals, social context, and narrative roles throughout the story. Finally, we render each utterance as expressive, character-conditioned speech, resulting in fully-voiced, multimodal video narratives. Our training-free framework generalizes across diverse story settings -- from fantasy adventures to slice-of-life episodes -- offering a scalable solution for coherent, character-grounded audiovisual storytelling.

Abstract: 1) Biological collections house millions of specimens with digital images increasingly available through open-access platforms. However, most imaging protocols were developed for human interpretation without considering automated analysis requirements. As computer vision applications revolutionize taxonomic identification and trait extraction, a critical gap exists between current digitization practices and computational analysis needs. This review provides the first comprehensive practical framework for optimizing biological specimen imaging for computer vision applications. 2) Through interdisciplinary collaboration between taxonomists, collection managers, ecologists, and computer scientists, we synthesized evidence-based recommendations addressing fundamental computer vision concepts and practical imaging considerations. We provide immediately actionable implementation guidance while identifying critical areas requiring community standards development. 3) Our framework encompasses ten interconnected considerations for optimizing image capture for computer vision-powered taxonomic identification and trait extraction. We translate these into practical implementation checklists, equipment selection guidelines, and a roadmap for community standards development including filename conventions, pixel density requirements, and cross-institutional protocols. 4)By bridging biological and computational disciplines, this approach unlocks automated analysis potential for millions of existing specimens and guides future digitization efforts toward unprecedented analytical capabilities.

Abstract: Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in histopathology pose a significant challenge for extensive medical image analysis due to their ultra-high resolution, massive scale, and intricate spatial relationships. Although existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approaches like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers demonstrate strong instance-level modeling capabilities, they encounter constraints regarding scalability and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the WSI-HGMamba, a novel framework that unifies the high-order relational modeling capabilities of the Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) with the linear-time sequential modeling efficiency of the State Space Models. At the core of our design is the HGMamba block, which integrates message passing, hypergraph scanning & flattening, and bidirectional state space modeling (Bi-SSM), enabling the model to retain both relational and contextual cues while remaining computationally efficient. Compared to Transformer and Graph Transformer counterparts, WSI-HGMamba achieves superior performance with up to 7* reduction in FLOPs. Extensive experiments on multiple public and private WSI benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient solution for slide-level understanding, making it a promising backbone for next-generation pathology AI systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly photorealistic visual content, offering practical substitutes for real images and videos in scenarios where acquiring real data is difficult or expensive. However, reliably substituting real visual content with AI-generated counterparts requires robust assessment of the perceived realness of AI-generated visual content, a challenging task due to its inherent subjective nature. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive human study evaluating the perceptual realness of both real and AI-generated images, resulting in a new dataset, containing images paired with subjective realness scores, introduced as RAISE in this paper. Further, we develop and train multiple models on RAISE to establish baselines for realness prediction. Our experimental results demonstrate that features derived from deep foundation vision models can effectively capture the subjective realness. RAISE thus provides a valuable resource for developing robust, objective models of perceptual realness assessment.

<title>UltraVSR: Achieving Ultra-Realistic Video Super-Resolution with Efficient One-Step Diffusion Space</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown great potential in generating realistic image detail. However, adapting these models to video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to their inherent stochasticity and lack of temporal modeling. Previous methods have attempted to mitigate this issue by incorporating motion information and temporal layers. However, unreliable motion estimation from low-resolution videos and costly multiple sampling steps with deep temporal layers limit them to short sequences. In this paper, we propose UltraVSR, a novel framework that enables ultra-realistic and temporally-coherent VSR through an efficient one-step diffusion space. A central component of UltraVSR is the Degradation-aware Reconstruction Scheduling (DRS), which estimates a degradation factor from the low-resolution input and transforms the iterative denoising process into a single-step reconstruction from low-resolution to high-resolution videos. To ensure temporal consistency, we propose a lightweight Recurrent Temporal Shift (RTS) module, including an RTS-convolution unit and an RTS-attention unit. By partially shifting feature components along the temporal dimension, it enables effective propagation, fusion, and alignment across frames without explicit temporal layers. The RTS module is integrated into a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model and is further enhanced through Spatio-temporal Joint Distillation (SJD), which improves temporally coherence while preserving realistic details. Additionally, we introduce a Temporally Asynchronous Inference (TAI) strategy to capture long-range temporal dependencies under limited memory constraints. Extensive experiments show that UltraVSR achieves state-of-the-art performance, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in a single sampling step. Code is available at https://github.com/yongliuy/UltraVSR.

Abstract: Livestreaming often involves interactions between streamers and objects, which is critical for understanding and regulating web content. While human-object interaction (HOI) detection has made some progress in general-purpose video downstream tasks, when applied to recognize the interaction behaviors between a streamer and different objects in livestreaming, it tends to focuses too much on the objects and neglects their interactions with the streamer, which leads to object bias. To solve this issue, we propose a prototype embedding optimization for human-object interaction detection (PeO-HOI). First, the livestreaming is preprocessed using object detection and tracking techniques to extract features of the human-object (HO) pairs. Then, prototype embedding optimization is adopted to mitigate the effect of object bias on HOI. Finally, after modelling the spatio-temporal context between HO pairs, the HOI detection results are obtained by the prediction head. The experimental results show that the detection accuracy of the proposed PeO-HOI method has detection accuracies of 37.19%@full, 51.42%@non-rare, 26.20%@rare on the publicly available dataset VidHOI, 45.13%@full, 62.78%@non-rare and 30.37%@rare on the self-built dataset BJUT-HOI, which effectively improves the HOI detection performance in livestreaming.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) typically pair a modestly sized vision encoder with a large language model (LLM), e.g., Llama-70B, making the decoder the primary computational burden during training. To reduce costs, a potential promising strategy is to first train the vision encoder using a small language model before transferring it to the large one. We construct small "surrogate models" that share the same embedding space and representation language as the large target LLM by directly inheriting its shallow layers. Vision encoders trained on the surrogate can then be directly transferred to the larger model, a process we call zero-shot grafting -- when plugged directly into the full-size target LLM, the grafted pair surpasses the encoder-surrogate pair and, on some benchmarks, even performs on par with full decoder training with the target LLM. Furthermore, our surrogate training approach reduces overall VLM training costs by ~45% when using Llama-70B as the decoder. The code is at https://github.com/facebookresearch/zero.

Abstract: Accurate 3D fruit counting in orchards is challenging due to heavy occlusion, semantic ambiguity between fruits and surrounding structures, and the high computational cost of volumetric reconstruction. Existing pipelines often rely on multi-view 2D segmentation and dense volumetric sampling, which lead to accumulated fusion errors and slow inference. We introduce FruitLangGS, a language-guided 3D fruit counting framework that reconstructs orchard-scale scenes using an adaptive-density Gaussian Splatting pipeline with radius-aware pruning and tile-based rasterization, enabling scalable 3D representation. During inference, compressed CLIP-aligned semantic vectors embedded in each Gaussian are filtered via a dual-threshold cosine similarity mechanism, retrieving Gaussians relevant to target prompts while suppressing common distractors (e.g., foliage), without requiring retraining or image-space masks. The selected Gaussians are then sampled into dense point clouds and clustered geometrically to estimate fruit instances, remaining robust under severe occlusion and viewpoint variation. Experiments on nine different orchard-scale datasets demonstrate that FruitLangGS consistently outperforms existing pipelines in instance counting recall, avoiding multi-view segmentation fusion errors and achieving up to 99.2\% recall on Fuji-SfM orchard dataset. Ablation studies further confirm that language-conditioned semantic embedding and dual-threshold prompt filtering are essential for suppressing distractors and improving counting accuracy under heavy occlusion. Beyond fruit counting, the same framework enables prompt-driven 3D semantic retrieval without retraining, highlighting the potential of language-guided 3D perception for scalable agricultural scene understanding.

Abstract: With the growing application of computer vision in agriculture, image analysis has become essential for tasks such as crop health monitoring and pest detection. However, significant domain shifts caused by environmental variations, different crop types, and diverse data acquisition methods hinder model generalization across regions, seasons, and complex agricultural settings. This paper investigates how Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques can address these challenges by improving cross-domain transferability in agricultural image analysis. Given the limited availability of labeled data, weak model adaptability, and dynamic field conditions, DA has emerged as a promising solution. The review systematically summarizes recent advances in DA for agricultural imagery, focusing on applications such as crop health monitoring, pest detection, and fruit recognition, where DA methods have improved performance in diverse domains. DA approaches are categorized into shallow and deep learning methods, including supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised strategies, with particular attention to adversarial learning-based techniques that have demonstrated strong potential in complex scenarios. In addition,the paper reviews key public agricultural image datasets, evaluating their strengths and limitations in DA research. In general, this work offers a comprehensive framework and critical insights to guide future research and development of domain adaptation in agricultural vision tasks.

Abstract: As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities -- from static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions -- yet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision-language model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and crucially offers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration. Datasets and code are available online.

Abstract: We introduce AllTracker: a model that estimates long-range point tracks by way of estimating the flow field between a query frame and every other frame of a video. Unlike existing point tracking methods, our approach delivers high-resolution and dense (all-pixel) correspondence fields, which can be visualized as flow maps. Unlike existing optical flow methods, our approach corresponds one frame to hundreds of subsequent frames, rather than just the next frame. We develop a new architecture for this task, blending techniques from existing work in optical flow and point tracking: the model performs iterative inference on low-resolution grids of correspondence estimates, propagating information spatially via 2D convolution layers, and propagating information temporally via pixel-aligned attention layers. The model is fast and parameter-efficient (16 million parameters), and delivers state-of-the-art point tracking accuracy at high resolution (i.e., tracking 768x1024 pixels, on a 40G GPU). A benefit of our design is that we can train jointly on optical flow datasets and point tracking datasets, and we find that doing so is crucial for top performance. We provide an extensive ablation study on our architecture details and training recipe, making it clear which details matter most. Our code and model weights are available at https://alltracker.github.io

Abstract: Architectural cultures across regions are characterized by stylistic diversity, shaped by historical, social, and technological contexts in addition to geograph-ical conditions. Understanding architectural styles requires the ability to describe and analyze the stylistic features of different architects from various regions through visual observations of architectural imagery. However, traditional studies of architectural culture have largely relied on subjective expert interpretations and historical literature reviews, often suffering from regional biases and limited ex-planatory scope. To address these challenges, this study proposes three core contributions: (1) We construct a professional architectural style dataset named ArchDiffBench, which comprises 1,765 high-quality architectural images and their corresponding style annotations, collected from different regions and historical periods. (2) We propose ArchiLense, an analytical framework grounded in Vision-Language Models and constructed using the ArchDiffBench dataset. By integrating ad-vanced computer vision techniques, deep learning, and machine learning algo-rithms, ArchiLense enables automatic recognition, comparison, and precise classi-fication of architectural imagery, producing descriptive language outputs that ar-ticulate stylistic differences. (3) Extensive evaluations show that ArchiLense achieves strong performance in architectural style recognition, with a 92.4% con-sistency rate with expert annotations and 84.5% classification accuracy, effec-tively capturing stylistic distinctions across images. The proposed approach transcends the subjectivity inherent in traditional analyses and offers a more objective and accurate perspective for comparative studies of architectural culture.

Abstract: We present SpINRv2, a neural framework for high-fidelity volumetric reconstruction using Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave (FMCW) radar. Extending our prior work (SpINR), this version introduces enhancements that allow accurate learning under high start frequencies-where phase aliasing and sub-bin ambiguity become prominent. Our core contribution is a fully differentiable frequency-domain forward model that captures the complex radar response using closed-form synthesis, paired with an implicit neural representation (INR) for continuous volumetric scene modeling. Unlike time-domain baselines, SpINRv2 directly supervises the complex frequency spectrum, preserving spectral fidelity while drastically reducing computational overhead. Additionally, we introduce sparsity and smoothness regularization to disambiguate sub-bin ambiguities that arise at fine range resolutions. Experimental results show that SpINRv2 significantly outperforms both classical and learning-based baselines, especially under high-frequency regimes, establishing a new benchmark for neural radar-based 3D imaging.

Abstract: In the context of the digital development of architecture, the automatic segmentation of walls and windows is a key step in improving the efficiency of building information models and computer-aided design. This study proposes an automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF). First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application of multimodal learning in the architectural field.

Abstract: Urban cultures and architectural styles vary significantly across cities due to geographical, chronological, historical, and socio-political factors. Understanding these differences is essential for anticipating how cities may evolve in the future. As representative cases of historical continuity and modern innovation in China, Beijing and Shenzhen offer valuable perspectives for exploring the transformation of urban streetscapes. However, conventional approaches to urban cultural studies often rely on expert interpretation and historical documentation, which are difficult to standardize across different contexts. To address this, we propose a multimodal research framework based on vision-language models, enabling automated and scalable analysis of urban streetscape style differences. This approach enhances the objectivity and data-driven nature of urban form research. The contributions of this study are as follows: First, we construct UrbanDiffBench, a curated dataset of urban streetscapes containing architectural images from different periods and regions. Second, we develop UrbanSense, the first vision-language-model-based framework for urban streetscape analysis, enabling the quantitative generation and comparison of urban style representations. Third, experimental results show that Over 80% of generated descriptions pass the t-test (p less than 0.05). High Phi scores (0.912 for cities, 0.833 for periods) from subjective evaluations confirm the method's ability to capture subtle stylistic differences. These results highlight the method's potential to quantify and interpret urban style evolution, offering a scientifically grounded lens for future design.

Abstract: We present VRBench, the first long narrative video benchmark crafted for evaluating large models' multi-step reasoning capabilities, addressing limitations in existing evaluations that overlook temporal reasoning and procedural validity. It comprises 960 long videos (with an average duration of 1.6 hours), along with 8,243 human-labeled multi-step question-answering pairs and 25,106 reasoning steps with timestamps. These videos are curated via a multi-stage filtering process including expert inter-rater reviewing to prioritize plot coherence. We develop a human-AI collaborative framework that generates coherent reasoning chains, each requiring multiple temporally grounded steps, spanning seven types (e.g., event attribution, implicit inference). VRBench designs a multi-phase evaluation pipeline that assesses models at both the outcome and process levels. Apart from the MCQs for the final results, we propose a progress-level LLM-guided scoring metric to evaluate the quality of the reasoning chain from multiple dimensions comprehensively. Through extensive evaluations of 12 LLMs and 19 VLMs on VRBench, we undertake a thorough analysis and provide valuable insights that advance the field of multi-step reasoning.

Abstract: The challenge in WiFi-based cross-domain Behavior Recognition lies in the significant interference of domain-specific signals on gesture variation. However, previous methods alleviate this interference by mapping the phase from multiple domains into a common feature space. If the Doppler Frequency Shift (DFS) signal is used to dynamically supplement the phase features to achieve better generalization, enabling model to not only explore a wider feature space but also avoid potential degradation of gesture semantic information. Specifically, we propose a novel Salient-aware Adaptive WiFi Sensing for Cross-domain Behavior Recognition (Wi-CBR}, which constructs a dual-branch self-attention module that captures temporal features from phase information reflecting dynamic path length variations, while extracting spatial features from DFS correlated with motion velocity. Moreover, we design a Saliency Guidance Module that employs group attention mechanisms to mine critical activity features, and utilizes gating mechanisms to optimize information entropy, facilitating feature fusion and enabling effective interaction between salient and non-salient behavior characteristics. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets (Widar3.0 and XRF55) demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled the generation of high-quality and photorealistic images from text. However, they often exhibit societal biases related to gender, race, and socioeconomic status, thereby potentially reinforcing harmful stereotypes and shaping public perception in unintended ways. While existing bias mitigation methods demonstrate effectiveness, they often encounter attribute entanglement, where adjustments to attributes relevant to the bias (i.e., target attributes) unintentionally alter attributes unassociated with the bias (i.e., non-target attributes), causing undesirable distribution shifts. To address this challenge, we introduce Entanglement-Free Attention (EFA), a method that accurately incorporates target attributes (e.g., White, Black, and Asian) while preserving non-target attributes (e.g., background) during bias mitigation. At inference time, EFA randomly samples a target attribute with equal probability and adjusts the cross-attention in selected layers to incorporate the sampled attribute, achieving a fair distribution of target attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EFA outperforms existing methods in mitigating bias while preserving non-target attributes, thereby maintaining the original model's output distribution and generative capacity.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have long been the cornerstone of target detection, but they are often limited by limited receptive fields, which hinders their ability to capture global contextual information. We re-examined the DETR-inspired detection head and found substantial redundancy in its self-attention module. To solve these problems, we introduced the Context-Gated Scale-Adaptive Detection Network (CSDN), a Transformer-based detection header inspired by human visual perception: when observing an object, we always concentrate on one site, perceive the surrounding environment, and glance around the object. This mechanism enables each region of interest (ROI) to adaptively select and combine feature dimensions and scale information from different patterns. CSDN provides more powerful global context modeling capabilities and can better adapt to objects of different sizes and structures. Our proposed detection head can directly replace the native heads of various CNN-based detectors, and only a few rounds of fine-tuning on the pre-trained weights can significantly improve the detection accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce DIP, a novel unsupervised post-training method designed to enhance dense image representations in large-scale pretrained vision encoders for in-context scene understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex self-distillation architectures, our method trains the vision encoder using pseudo-tasks that explicitly simulate downstream in-context scenarios, inspired by meta-learning principles. To enable post-training on unlabeled data, we propose an automatic mechanism for generating in-context tasks that combines a pretrained diffusion model and the vision encoder itself. DIP is simple, unsupervised, and computationally efficient, requiring less than 9 hours on a single A100 GPU. By learning dense representations through pseudo in-context tasks, it achieves strong performance across a wide variety of downstream real-world in-context scene understanding tasks. It outperforms both the initial vision encoder and prior methods, offering a practical and effective solution for improving dense representations.

Abstract: Real-world object detection systems, such as those in autonomous driving and surveillance, must continuously learn new object categories and simultaneously adapt to changing environmental conditions. Existing approaches, Class Incremental Object Detection (CIOD) and Domain Incremental Object Detection (DIOD) only address one aspect of this challenge. CIOD struggles in unseen domains, while DIOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learning new classes, limiting their real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Dual Incremental Object Detection (DuIOD), a more practical setting that simultaneously handles class and domain shifts in an exemplar-free manner. We propose DuET, a Task Arithmetic-based model merging framework that enables stable incremental learning while mitigating sign conflicts through a novel Directional Consistency Loss. Unlike prior methods, DuET is detector-agnostic, allowing models like YOLO11 and RT-DETR to function as real-time incremental object detectors. To comprehensively evaluate both retention and adaptation, we introduce the Retention-Adaptability Index (RAI), which combines the Average Retention Index (Avg RI) for catastrophic forgetting and the Average Generalization Index for domain adaptability into a common ground. Extensive experiments on the Pascal Series and Diverse Weather Series demonstrate DuET's effectiveness, achieving a +13.12% RAI improvement while preserving 89.3% Avg RI on the Pascal Series (4 tasks), as well as a +11.39% RAI improvement with 88.57% Avg RI on the Diverse Weather Series (3 tasks), outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: We propose SiM3D, the first benchmark considering the integration of multiview and multimodal information for comprehensive 3D anomaly detection and segmentation (ADS), where the task is to produce a voxel-based Anomaly Volume. Moreover, SiM3D focuses on a scenario of high interest in manufacturing: single-instance anomaly detection, where only one object, either real or synthetic, is available for training. In this respect, SiM3D stands out as the first ADS benchmark that addresses the challenge of generalising from synthetic training data to real test data. SiM3D includes a novel multimodal multiview dataset acquired using top-tier industrial sensors and robots. The dataset features multiview high-resolution images (12 Mpx) and point clouds (7M points) for 333 instances of eight types of objects, alongside a CAD model for each type. We also provide manually annotated 3D segmentation GTs for anomalous test samples. To establish reference baselines for the proposed multiview 3D ADS task, we adapt prominent singleview methods and assess their performance using novel metrics that operate on Anomaly Volumes.

Abstract: The recent advancements in large foundation models have driven the success of open-set image segmentation, a task focused on segmenting objects beyond predefined categories. Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes, texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts at boundaries of target regions due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.

<title>Rethinking Visual Token Reduction in LVLMs under Cross-modal Misalignment</title>

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) encode visual inputs as dense sequences of patch-level tokens to capture fine-grained semantics. These visual tokens often outnumber their textual counterparts by a large margin, leading to substantial computational overhead and limiting the scalability of LVLMs in practice. Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to or within the large language models (LLMs). However, most in-LLM reduction approaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that textual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this work, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms of cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of text-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a training-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual tokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on textual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy, we treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a progressive pruning pipeline. Our method performs dominant token selection and lightweight contextual merging at multiple stages, enabling fine-grained visual information to be retained even under aggressive token budgets. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks show that VisionDrop achieves consistent improvements over existing approaches, despite requiring no additional training or complex modifications. Notably, when integrated with LLaVA-NeXT-7B, VisionDrop achieves a 2.7x reduction in inference latency and 6x in FLOPs, while retaining 95.71% of the original performance.

Abstract: We address the task of zero-shot video classification for extremely fine-grained actions (e.g., Windmill Dunk in basketball), where no video examples or temporal annotations are available for unseen classes. While image-language models (e.g., CLIP, SigLIP) show strong open-set recognition, they lack temporal modeling needed for video understanding. We propose ActAlign, a truly zero-shot, training-free method that formulates video classification as a sequence alignment problem, preserving the generalization strength of pretrained image-language models. For each class, a large language model (LLM) generates an ordered sequence of sub-actions, which we align with video frames using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in a shared embedding space. Without any video-text supervision or fine-tuning, ActAlign achieves 30.5% accuracy on ActionAtlas--the most diverse benchmark of fine-grained actions across multiple sports--where human performance is only 61.6%. ActAlign outperforms billion-parameter video-language models while using 8x fewer parameters. Our approach is model-agnostic and domain-general, demonstrating that structured language priors combined with classical alignment methods can unlock the open-set recognition potential of image-language models for fine-grained video understanding.

Abstract: We introduce the concept of a subjective camera to reconstruct meaningful moments that physical cameras fail to capture. We propose Subjective Camera 0.1, a framework for reconstructing real-world scenes from readily accessible subjective readouts, i.e., textual descriptions and progressively drawn rough sketches. Built on optimization-based alignment of diffusion models, our approach avoids large-scale paired training data and mitigates generalization issues. To address the challenge of integrating multiple abstract concepts in real-world scenarios, we design a Sequence-Aware Sketch-Guided Diffusion framework with three loss terms for concept-wise sequential optimization, following the natural order of subjective readouts. Experiments on two datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in image quality as well as spatial and semantic alignment with target scenes. User studies with 40 participants further confirm that our approach is consistently preferred.Our project page is at: subjective-camera.github.io

Abstract: Personalization, while extensively studied in conventional autonomous driving pipelines, has been largely overlooked in the context of end-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD), despite its critical role in fostering user trust, safety perception, and real-world adoption. A primary bottleneck is the absence of large-scale real-world datasets that systematically capture driving preferences, severely limiting the development and evaluation of personalized E2EAD models. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale real-world dataset explicitly curated for personalized E2EAD, integrating comprehensive scene topology with rich dynamic context derived from agent dynamics and semantics inferred via a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM). We propose a hybrid annotation pipeline that combines behavioral analysis, rule-and-distribution-based heuristics, and subjective semantic modeling guided by VLM reasoning, with final refinement through human-in-the-loop verification. Building upon this dataset, we introduce the first standardized benchmark for systematically evaluating personalized E2EAD models. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art architectures demonstrate that incorporating personalized driving preferences significantly improves behavioral alignment with human demonstrations.

Abstract: As the core operator of Transformers, Softmax Attention exhibits excellent global modeling capabilities. However, its quadratic complexity limits its applicability to vision tasks. In contrast, Linear Attention shares a similar formulation with Softmax Attention while achieving linear complexity, enabling efficient global information modeling. Nevertheless, Linear Attention suffers from a significant performance degradation compared to standard Softmax Attention. In this paper, we analyze the underlying causes of this issue based on the formulation of Linear Attention. We find that, unlike Softmax Attention, Linear Attention entirely disregards the magnitude information of the Query. This prevents the attention score distribution from dynamically adapting as the Query scales. As a result, despite its structural similarity to Softmax Attention, Linear Attention exhibits a significantly different attention score distribution. Based on this observation, we propose Magnitude-Aware Linear Attention (MALA), which modifies the computation of Linear Attention to fully incorporate the Query's magnitude. This adjustment allows MALA to generate an attention score distribution that closely resembles Softmax Attention while exhibiting a more well-balanced structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of MALA on multiple tasks, including image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, natural language processing, speech recognition, and image generation. Our MALA achieves strong results on all of these tasks. Code will be available at https://github.com/qhfan/MALA

Abstract: The widespread use of deep learning face recognition raises several security concerns. Although prior works point at existing vulnerabilities, DNN backdoor attacks against real-life, unconstrained systems dealing with images captured in the wild remain a blind spot of the literature. This paper conducts the first system-level study of backdoors in deep learning-based face recognition systems. This paper yields four contributions by exploring the feasibility of DNN backdoors on these pipelines in a holistic fashion. We demonstrate for the first time two backdoor attacks on the face detection task: face generation and face landmark shift attacks. We then show that face feature extractors trained with large margin losses also fall victim to backdoor attacks. Combining our models, we then show using 20 possible pipeline configurations and 15 attack cases that a single backdoor enables an attacker to bypass the entire function of a system. Finally, we provide stakeholders with several best practices and countermeasures.

Abstract: Existing generative approaches for guided image synthesis of multi-object scenes typically rely on 2D controls in the image or text space. As a result, these methods struggle to maintain and respect consistent three-dimensional geometric structure, underlying the scene. In this paper, we propose a novel conditioning approach, training method and adapter network that can be plugged into pretrained text-to-image diffusion models. Our approach provides a way to endow such models with 3D-awareness, while leveraging their rich prior knowledge. Our method supports camera control, conditioning on explicit 3D geometries and, for the first time, accounts for the entire context of a scene, i.e., both on and off-screen items, to synthesize plausible and semantically rich images. Despite its multi-modal nature, our model is lightweight, requires a reasonable number of data for supervised learning and shows remarkable generalization power. We also introduce methods for intuitive and consistent image editing and restyling, e.g., by positioning, rotating or resizing individual objects in a scene. Our method integrates well within various image creation workflows and enables a richer set of applications compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: Recent work on human animation usually incorporates large-scale video models, thereby achieving more vivid performance. However, the practical use of such methods is hindered by the slow inference speed and high computational demands. Moreover, traditional work typically employs separate models for each animation task, increasing costs in multi-task scenarios and worsening the dilemma. To address these limitations, we introduce EchoMimicV3, an efficient framework that unifies multi-task and multi-modal human animation. At the core of EchoMimicV3 lies a threefold design: a Soup-of-Tasks paradigm, a Soup-of-Modals paradigm, and a novel training and inference strategy. The Soup-of-Tasks leverages multi-task mask inputs and a counter-intuitive task allocation strategy to achieve multi-task gains without multi-model pains. Meanwhile, the Soup-of-Modals introduces a Coupled-Decoupled Multi-Modal Cross Attention module to inject multi-modal conditions, complemented by a Multi-Modal Timestep Phase-aware Dynamical Allocation mechanism to modulate multi-modal mixtures. Besides, we propose Negative Direct Preference Optimization, Phase-aware Negative Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), and Long Video CFG, which ensure stable training and inference. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that EchoMimicV3, with a minimal model size of 1.3 billion parameters, achieves competitive performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. We are committed to open-sourcing our code for community use.

Abstract: Accurate gland segmentation in histopathology images is essential for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, significant variability in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining and tissue morphology, combined with limited annotated data, poses major challenges for automated segmentation. To address this, we propose Color-Structure Dual-Student (CSDS), a novel semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to learn disentangled representations of stain appearance and tissue structure. CSDS comprises two specialized student networks: one trained on stain-augmented inputs to model chromatic variation, and the other on structure-augmented inputs to capture morphological cues. A shared teacher network, updated via Exponential Moving Average (EMA), supervises both students through pseudo-labels. To further improve label reliability, we introduce stain-aware and structure-aware uncertainty estimation modules that adaptively modulate the contribution of each student during training. Experiments on the GlaS and CRAG datasets show that CSDS achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-label settings, with Dice score improvements of up to 1.2% on GlaS and 0.7% on CRAG at 5% labeled data, and 0.7% and 1.4% at 10%. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/hieuphamha19/CSDS.

Abstract: The problem of generating a perpetual dynamic scene from a single view is an important problem with widespread applications in augmented and virtual reality, and robotics. However, since dynamic scenes regularly change over time, a key challenge is to ensure that different generated views be consistent with the underlying 3D motions. Prior work learns such consistency by training on multiple views, but the generated scene regions often interpolate between training views and fail to generate perpetual views. To address this issue, we propose DynamicVoyager, which reformulates dynamic scene generation as a scene outpainting problem with new dynamic content. As 2D outpainting models struggle at generating 3D consistent motions from a single 2D view, we enrich 2D pixels with information from their 3D rays that facilitates learning of 3D motion consistency. More specifically, we first map the single-view video input to a dynamic point cloud using the estimated video depths. We then render a partial video of the point cloud from a novel view and outpaint the missing regions using ray information (e.g., the distance from a ray to the point cloud) to generate 3D consistent motions. Next, we use the outpainted video to update the point cloud, which is used for outpainting the scene from future novel views. Moreover, we can control the generated content with the input text prompt. Experiments show that our model can generate perpetual scenes with consistent motions along fly-through cameras.

Abstract: Tombstones are historically and culturally rich artifacts, encapsulating individual lives, community memory, historical narratives and artistic expression. Yet, many tombstones today face significant preservation challenges, including physical erosion, vandalism, environmental degradation, and political shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel multi-modal framework for tombstones digitization, aiming to improve the interpretation, organization and retrieval of tombstone content. Our approach leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to translate tombstone images into structured Tombstone Meaning Representations (TMRs), capturing both image and text information. To further enrich semantic parsing, we incorporate retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for integrate externally dependent elements such as toponyms, occupation codes, and ontological concepts. Compared to traditional OCR-based pipelines, our method improves parsing accuracy from an F1 score of 36.1 to 89.5. We additionally evaluate the model's robustness across diverse linguistic and cultural inscriptions, and simulate physical degradation through image fusion to assess performance under noisy or damaged conditions. Our work represents the first attempt to formalize tombstone understanding using large vision-language models, presenting implications for heritage preservation.

However, due to the imbalance between self-consistency and cross-consistency, these CD-based methods inherently suffer from improper conditional guidance, leading to sub-optimal generation results. To address this issue, we present SegmentDreamer, a novel framework designed to fully unleash the potential of consistency models for high-fidelity text-to-3D generation. Specifically, we reformulate SDS through the proposed Segmented Consistency Trajectory Distillation (SCTD), effectively mitigating the imbalance issues by explicitly defining the relationship between self- and cross-consistency. Moreover, SCTD partitions the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) trajectory into multiple sub-trajectories and ensures consistency within each segment, which can theoretically provide a significantly tighter upper bound on distillation error. Additionally, we propose a distillation pipeline for a more swift and stable generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SegmentDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in visual quality, enabling high-fidelity 3D asset creation through 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS).

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for reconstructing dynamic human-object interactions from monocular video that overcomes challenges associated with occlusions and temporal inconsistencies. Traditional 3D reconstruction methods typically assume static objects or full visibility of dynamic subjects, leading to degraded performance when these assumptions are violated-particularly in scenarios where mutual occlusions occur. To address this, our framework leverages amodal completion to infer the complete structure of partially obscured regions. Unlike conventional approaches that operate on individual frames, our method integrates temporal context, enforcing coherence across video sequences to incrementally refine and stabilize reconstructions. This template-free strategy adapts to varying conditions without relying on predefined models, significantly enhancing the recovery of intricate details in dynamic scenes. We validate our approach using 3D Gaussian Splatting on challenging monocular videos, demonstrating superior precision in handling occlusions and maintaining temporal stability compared to existing techniques.

<title>$I^{2}$-World: Intra-Inter Tokenization for Efficient Dynamic 4D Scene Forecasting</title>

Abstract: Forecasting the evolution of 3D scenes and generating unseen scenarios via occupancy-based world models offers substantial potential for addressing corner cases in autonomous driving systems. While tokenization has revolutionized image and video generation, efficiently tokenizing complex 3D scenes remains a critical challenge for 3D world models. To address this, we propose $I^{2}$-World, an efficient framework for 4D occupancy forecasting. Our method decouples scene tokenization into intra-scene and inter-scene tokenizers. The intra-scene tokenizer employs a multi-scale residual quantization strategy to hierarchically compress 3D scenes while preserving spatial details. The inter-scene tokenizer residually aggregates temporal dependencies across timesteps. This dual design preserves the compactness of 3D tokenizers while retaining the dynamic expressiveness of 4D tokenizers. Unlike decoder-only GPT-style autoregressive models, $I^{2}$-World adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder aggregates spatial context from the current scene and predicts a transformation matrix to enable high-level control over scene generation. The decoder, conditioned on this matrix and historical tokens, ensures temporal consistency during generation. Experiments demonstrate that $I^{2}$-World achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by 25.1\% in mIoU and 36.9\% in IoU for 4D occupancy forecasting while exhibiting exceptional computational efficiency: it requires merely 2.9 GB of training memory and achieves real-time inference at 37.0 FPS.

Abstract: Diffusion models exhibit impressive generative capabilities but are significantly impacted by exposure bias. In this paper, we make a key observation: the energy of predicted noisy samples in the reverse process continuously declines compared to perturbed samples in the forward process. Building on this, we identify two important findings: 1) The reduction in energy follows distinct patterns in the low-frequency and high-frequency subbands; 2) The subband energy of reverse-process reconstructed samples is consistently lower than that of forward-process ones, and both are lower than the original data samples. Based on the first finding, we introduce a dynamic frequency regulation mechanism utilizing wavelet transforms, which separately adjusts the low- and high-frequency subbands. Leveraging the second insight, we derive the rigorous mathematical form of exposure bias. It is worth noting that, our method is training-free and plug-and-play, significantly improving the generative quality of various diffusion models and frameworks with negligible computational cost.

Abstract: Despite the success of diffusion models in image generation tasks such as text-to-image, the enormous computational complexity of diffusion models limits their use in resource-constrained environments. To address this, network quantization has emerged as a promising solution for designing efficient diffusion models. However, existing diffusion model quantization methods do not consider input conditions, such as text prompts, as an essential source of information for quantization. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization method dubbed Quantization of Language-to-Image diffusion models using text Prompts (QLIP). QLIP leverages text prompts to guide the selection of bit precision for every layer at each time step. In addition, QLIP can be seamlessly integrated into existing quantization methods to enhance quantization efficiency. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of QLIP in reducing computational complexity and improving the quality of the generated images across various datasets.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models (DMs) have been propelled by alignment methods that post-train models to better conform to human preferences. However, these approaches typically require computation-intensive training of a base model and a reward model, which not only incurs substantial computational overhead but may also compromise model accuracy and training efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose Inversion-DPO, a novel alignment framework that circumvents reward modeling by reformulating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with DDIM inversion for DMs. Our method conducts intractable posterior sampling in Diffusion-DPO with the deterministic inversion from winning and losing samples to noise and thus derive a new post-training paradigm. This paradigm eliminates the need for auxiliary reward models or inaccurate appromixation, significantly enhancing both precision and efficiency of training. We apply Inversion-DPO to a basic task of text-to-image generation and a challenging task of compositional image generation. Extensive experiments show substantial performance improvements achieved by Inversion-DPO compared to existing post-training methods and highlight the ability of the trained generative models to generate high-fidelity compositionally coherent images. For the post-training of compostitional image geneation, we curate a paired dataset consisting of 11,140 images with complex structural annotations and comprehensive scores, designed to enhance the compositional capabilities of generative models. Inversion-DPO explores a new avenue for efficient, high-precision alignment in diffusion models, advancing their applicability to complex realistic generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent progress has been made in region-aware vision-language modeling, particularly with the emergence of the Describe Anything Model (DAM). DAM is capable of generating detailed descriptions of any specific image areas or objects without the need for additional localized image-text alignment supervision. We hypothesize that such region-level descriptive capability is beneficial for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), especially in challenging scenarios involving images with dense text. In such settings, the fine-grained extraction of textual information is crucial to producing correct answers. Motivated by this, we introduce DAM-QA, a framework with a tailored evaluation protocol, developed to investigate and harness the region-aware capabilities from DAM for the text-rich VQA problem that requires reasoning over text-based information within images. DAM-QA incorporates a mechanism that aggregates answers from multiple regional views of image content, enabling more effective identification of evidence that may be tied to text-related elements. Experiments on six VQA benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms the baseline DAM, with a notable 7+ point gain on DocVQA. DAM-QA also achieves the best overall performance among region-aware models with fewer parameters, significantly narrowing the gap with strong generalist VLMs. These results highlight the potential of DAM-like models for text-rich and broader VQA tasks when paired with efficient usage and integration strategies. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Linvyl/DAM-QA.git.

Abstract: Person Re-Identification is a key and challenging task in video surveillance. While traditional methods rely on visual data, issues like poor lighting, occlusion, and suboptimal angles often hinder performance. To address these challenges, we introduce WhoFi, a novel pipeline that utilizes Wi-Fi signals for person re-identification. Biometric features are extracted from Channel State Information (CSI) and processed through a modular Deep Neural Network (DNN) featuring a Transformer-based encoder. The network is trained using an in-batch negative loss function to learn robust and generalizable biometric signatures. Experiments on the NTU-Fi dataset show that our approach achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods, confirming its effectiveness in identifying individuals via Wi-Fi signals.

Abstract: Real-time multi-label video classification on embedded devices is constrained by limited compute and energy budgets. Yet, video streams exhibit structural properties such as label sparsity, temporal continuity, and label co-occurrence that can be leveraged for more efficient inference. We introduce Polymorph, a context-aware framework that activates a minimal set of lightweight Low Rank Adapters (LoRA) per frame. Each adapter specializes in a subset of classes derived from co-occurrence patterns and is implemented as a LoRA weight over a shared backbone. At runtime, Polymorph dynamically selects and composes only the adapters needed to cover the active labels, avoiding full-model switching and weight merging. This modular strategy improves scalability while reducing latency and energy overhead. Polymorph achieves 40% lower energy consumption and improves mAP by 9 points over strong baselines on the TAO dataset. Polymorph is open source at https://github.com/inference-serving/polymorph/.

Abstract: Zero-shot human-object interaction (HOI) detection remains a challenging task, particularly in generalizing to unseen actions. Existing methods address this challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge beyond the training data. However, they either struggle to distinguish actions involving the same object or demonstrate limited generalization to unseen classes. In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with Low-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both enhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction. In training, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank factorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights. These features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves shared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes. Subsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI class and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction representations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight adaptation with LLM-derived action regularization. Experimental results show that our method sets a new state-of-the-art across zero-shot HOI settings on HICO-DET, achieving an unseen-class mAP of 27.91 in the unseen-verb setting.

Abstract: Current researches on Deepfake forensics often treat detection as a classification task or temporal forgery localization problem, which are usually restrictive, time-consuming, and challenging to scale for large datasets. To resolve these issues, we present a multimodal deviation perceiving framework for weakly-supervised temporal forgery localization (MDP), which aims to identify temporal partial forged segments using only video-level annotations. The MDP proposes a novel multimodal interaction mechanism (MI) and an extensible deviation perceiving loss to perceive multimodal deviation, which achieves the refined start and end timestamps localization of forged segments. Specifically, MI introduces a temporal property preserving cross-modal attention to measure the relevance between the visual and audio modalities in the probabilistic embedding space. It could identify the inter-modality deviation and construct comprehensive video features for temporal forgery localization. To explore further temporal deviation for weakly-supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, aiming at enlarging the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reducing that of genuine samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and achieve comparable results to fully-supervised approaches in several evaluation metrics.

<title>Eyes Will Shut: A Vision-Based Next GPS Location Prediction Model by Reinforcement Learning from Visual Map Feed Back</title>

Abstract: Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However, the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor, which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Recovering point clouds involves the sequential process of sampling and restoration, yet existing methods struggle to effectively leverage both topological and geometric attributes. To address this, we propose an end-to-end architecture named \textbf{TopGeoFormer}, which maintains these critical properties throughout the sampling and restoration phases. First, we revisit traditional feature extraction techniques to yield topological embedding using a continuous mapping of relative relationships between neighboring points, and integrate it in both phases for preserving the structure of the original space. Second, we propose the \textbf{InterTwining Attention} to fully merge topological and geometric embeddings, which queries shape with local awareness in both phases to form a learnable 3D shape context facilitated with point-wise, point-shape-wise, and intra-shape features. Third, we introduce a full geometry loss and a topological constraint loss to optimize the embeddings in both Euclidean and topological spaces. The geometry loss uses inconsistent matching between coarse-to-fine generations and targets for reconstructing better geometric details, and the constraint loss limits embedding variances for better approximation of the topological space. In experiments, we comprehensively analyze the circumstances using the conventional and learning-based sampling/upsampling/recovery algorithms. The quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing sampling and recovery methods.

Abstract: Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric priors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground, and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes. It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy reconstruction as a new paradigm for scalable auto-labeling. Project Page: https://gs-occ3d.github.io/

Abstract: In high-energy physics, anti-neutrons ($\bar{n}$) are fundamental particles that frequently appear as final-state particles, and the reconstruction of their kinematic properties provides an important probe for understanding the governing principles. However, this confronts significant challenges instrumentally with the electromagnetic calorimeter (EMC), a typical experimental sensor but recovering the information of incident $\bar{n}$ insufficiently. In this study, we introduce Vision Calorimeter (ViC), a baseline method for anti-neutron reconstruction that leverages deep learning detectors to analyze the implicit relationships between EMC responses and incident $\bar{n}$ characteristics. Our motivation lies in that energy distributions of $\bar{n}$ samples deposited in the EMC cell arrays embody rich contextual information. Converted to 2-D images, such contextual energy distributions can be used to predict the status of $\bar{n}$ ($i.e.$, incident position and momentum) through a deep learning detector along with pseudo bounding boxes and a specified training objective. Experimental results demonstrate that ViC substantially outperforms the conventional reconstruction approach, reducing the prediction error of incident position by 42.81% (from 17.31$^{\circ}$ to 9.90$^{\circ}$). More importantly, this study for the first time realizes the measurement of incident $\bar{n}$ momentum, underscoring the potential of deep learning detectors for particle reconstruction.

Abstract: Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a non-invasive imaging modality, similar to ultrasound, with wide-ranging medical applications. Conventional PACT images are degraded by wavefront distortion caused by the heterogeneous speed of sound (SOS) in tissue. Accounting for these effects can improve image quality and provide medically useful information, but measuring the SOS directly is burdensome and the existing joint reconstruction method is computationally expensive. Traditional supervised learning techniques are currently inaccessible in this data-starved domain. In this work, we introduce an efficient, self-supervised joint reconstruction method that recovers SOS and high-quality images for ring array PACT systems. To solve this semi-blind inverse problem, we parametrize the SOS using either a pixel grid or a neural field (NF) and update it directly by backpropagating the gradients through a differentiable imaging forward model. Our method removes SOS aberrations more accurately and 35x faster than the current SOTA. We demonstrate the success of our method quantitatively in simulation and qualitatively on experimentally-collected and in vivo data. Our code and synthetic numerical phantoms are available on our project page: https://lukeli0425.github.io/Coord-SoS-PACT/.

Abstract: To address the increasing prevalence of (audio-)visual data on social media, and to capture the evolving and dynamic nature of this communication, researchers have begun to explore the potential of unsupervised approaches for analyzing multimodal online content. However, existing research often neglects visual content beyond memes, and in addition lacks methods to compare topic models across modalities. Our study addresses these gaps by applying multimodal topic modeling for analyzing conspiracy theories in German-language Telegram channels. We use BERTopic with CLIP for the analysis of textual and visual data in a corpus of ~40, 000 Telegram messages posted in October 2023 in 571 German-language Telegram channels known for disseminating conspiracy theories. Through this dataset, we provide insights into unimodal and multimodal topic models by analyzing symmetry and intersections of topics across modalities. We demonstrate the variety of textual and visual content shared in the channels discovered through the topic modeling, and propose a conceptual framework for the analysis of textual and visual discursive strategies in the communication of conspiracy theories. We apply the framework in a case study of the topic group Israel Gaza.

Abstract: Efficient acquisition of real-world embodied data has been increasingly critical. However, large-scale demonstrations captured by remote operation tend to take extremely high costs and fail to scale up the data size in an efficient manner. Sampling the episodes under a simulated environment is a promising way for large-scale collection while existing simulators fail to high-fidelity modeling on texture and physics. To address these limitations, we introduce the RoboGSim, a real2sim2real robotic simulator, powered by 3D Gaussian Splatting and the physics engine. RoboGSim mainly includes four parts: Gaussian Reconstructor, Digital Twins Builder, Scene Composer, and Interactive Engine. It can synthesize the simulated data with novel views, objects, trajectories, and scenes. RoboGSim also provides an online, reproducible, and safe evaluation for different manipulation policies. The real2sim and sim2real transfer experiments show a high consistency in the texture and physics. We compared the test results of RoboGSim data and real robot data on both RoboGSim and real robot platforms. The experimental results show that the RoboGSim data model can achieve zero-shot performance on the real robot, with results comparable to real robot data. Additionally, in experiments with novel perspectives and novel scenes, the RoboGSim data model performed even better on the real robot than the real robot data model. This not only helps reduce the sim2real gap but also addresses the limitations of real robot data collection, such as its single-source and high cost. We hope RoboGSim serves as a closed-loop simulator for fair comparison on policy learning. More information can be found on our project page https://robogsim.github.io/.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation of brain tumors in intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) images could facilitate localization of tumor tissue during resection surgery. The lack of large annotated datasets limits the current models performances. In this paper, we investigated the use of tumor annotations in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which are more accessible than annotations in iUS images, for training of deep learning models for iUS brain tumor segmentation. We used 180 annotated MRI scans with corresponding unannotated iUS images, and 29 annotated iUS images. Image registration was performed to transfer the MRI annotations to the corresponding iUS images before training the nnU-Net model with different configurations of the data and label origins. The results showed no significant difference in Dice score for a model trained with only MRI annotated tumors compared to models trained with only iUS annotations and both, and to expert annotations, indicating that MRI tumor annotations can be used as a substitute for iUS tumor annotations to train a deep learning model for automatic brain tumor segmentation in iUS images. The best model obtained an average Dice score of $0.62\pm0.31$, compared to $0.67\pm0.25$ for an expert neurosurgeon, where the performance on larger tumors were similar, but lower for the models on smaller tumors. In addition, the results showed that removing smaller tumors from the training sets improved the results.

Abstract: Given the diversity of devices and the product upgrades, cross-device research has become an urgent issue that needs to be tackled. To this end, we pioneer in probing the cross-device (cameras & robotics) grasping policy in the 3D open world. Specifically, we construct two real-world grasping setups, employing robotic arms and cameras from completely different manufacturers. To minimize domain differences in point clouds from diverse cameras, we adopt clustering methods to generate 3D object proposals. However, existing clustering methods are limited to closed-set scenarios, which confines the robotic graspable object categories and ossifies the deployment scenarios. To extend these methods to open-world settings, we introduce the SSGC-Seg module that enables category-agnostic 3D object detection. The proposed module transforms the original multi-class semantic information into binary semantic cues-foreground and background by analyzing the SoftMax value of each point, and then clusters the foreground points based on geometric information to form initial object proposals. Furthermore, ScoreNet{\ddag} is designed to score each detection result, and the robotic arm prioritizes grasping the object with the highest confidence score. Experiments on two different types of setups highlight the effectiveness and robustness of our policy for cross-device robotics grasping research. Our code is provided in the supplementary and will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC), a central challenge is distinguishing AI-synthesized images from natural images. Despite the impressive capabilities of advanced AI generative models in producing visually compelling content, significant discrepancies remain when compared to natural images. To systematically investigate and quantify these differences, we construct a large-scale multimodal dataset named DANI, comprising 5,000 natural images and over 440,000 AI-generated image (AIGI) samples produced by nine representative models using both unimodal and multimodal prompts, including Text-to-Image (T2I), Image-to-Image (I2I), and Text and Image-to-Image (TI2I). We then introduce D-Judge, a benchmark designed to answer the critical question: how far are AI-generated images from truly realistic images? Our fine-grained evaluation framework assesses DANI across five key dimensions: naive visual quality, semantic alignment, aesthetic appeal, downstream task applicability, and coordinated human validation. Extensive experiments reveal substantial discrepancies across these dimensions, highlighting the importance of aligning quantitative metrics with human judgment to achieve a comprehensive understanding of AI-generated image quality. The code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/ryliu68/DJudge and https://huggingface.co/datasets/Renyang/DANI.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large models, driven by their exceptional abilities in learning and generalization through large-scale pre-training, has reshaped the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI). These models are now foundational to a wide range of applications, including conversational AI, recommendation systems, autonomous driving, content generation, medical diagnostics, and scientific discovery. However, their widespread deployment also exposes them to significant safety risks, raising concerns about robustness, reliability, and ethical implications. This survey provides a systematic review of current safety research on large models, covering Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models, Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Diffusion Models (DMs), and large-model-powered Agents. Our contributions are summarized as follows: (1) We present a comprehensive taxonomy of safety threats to these models, including adversarial attacks, data poisoning, backdoor attacks, jailbreak and prompt injection attacks, energy-latency attacks, data and model extraction attacks, and emerging agent-specific threats. (2) We review defense strategies proposed for each type of attacks if available and summarize the commonly used datasets and benchmarks for safety research. (3) Building on this, we identify and discuss the open challenges in large model safety, emphasizing the need for comprehensive safety evaluations, scalable and effective defense mechanisms, and sustainable data practices. More importantly, we highlight the necessity of collective efforts from the research community and international collaboration. Our work can serve as a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, fostering the ongoing development of comprehensive defense systems and platforms to safeguard AI models.

<title>A novel approach to navigate the taxonomic hierarchy to address the Open-World Scenarios in Medicinal Plant Classification</title>

Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel approach for plant hierarchical taxonomy classification by posing the problem as an open class problem. It is observed that existing methods for medicinal plant classification often fail to perform hierarchical classification and accurately identifying unknown species, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensive plant taxonomy classification. Thus we address the problem of unknown species classification by assigning it best hierarchical labels. We propose a novel method, which integrates DenseNet121, Multi-Scale Self-Attention (MSSA) and cascaded classifiers for hierarchical classification. The approach systematically categorizes medicinal plants at multiple taxonomic levels, from phylum to species, ensuring detailed and precise classification. Using multi scale space attention, the model captures both local and global contextual information from the images, improving the distinction between similar species and the identification of new ones. It uses attention scores to focus on important features across multiple scales. The proposed method provides a solution for hierarchical classification, showcasing superior performance in identifying both known and unknown species. The model was tested on two state-of-art datasets with and without background artifacts and so that it can be deployed to tackle real word application. We used unknown species for testing our model. For unknown species the model achieved an average accuracy of 83.36%, 78.30%, 60.34% and 43.32% for predicting correct phylum, class, order and family respectively. Our proposed model size is almost four times less than the existing state of the art methods making it easily deploy able in real world application.

<title>Style Content Decomposition-based Data Augmentation for Domain Generalizable Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Due to domain shifts across diverse medical imaging modalities, learned segmentation models often suffer significant performance degradation during deployment. These domain shifts, typically caused by variations in imaging systems, generally comprise two principal components: 1) \textbf{"style" shifts}, referring to global disparities in image properties such as illumination, contrast, and color; and 2) \textbf{"content" shifts}, which involve local discrepancies in anatomical structures. To address domain shifts in medical image segmentation, a core challenge arises: how can we decouple the factors within images that determine their "style" and "content" components? To this end, we first propose a linear style-content decomposition method that factorizes an image into style codes and content maps, explicitly modeling the "style" and "content" components. Building on this, we introduce a \textbf{Sty}le-\textbf{Con}tent decomposition-based data \textbf{a}ugmentation algorithm (StyCona), which leverages this decomposition strategy to guide augmentation of both the global style and local content of source-domain images, enabling the training of a well-generalized model for domain-generalizable medical image segmentation. StyCona is a simple yet effective plug-and-play module that substantially improves model generalization without requiring additional training parameters or modifications to segmentation model architectures. Experiments on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and fundus photography segmentation tasks, with single and multiple target domains respectively, demonstrate the effectiveness of StyCona and its superiority over state-of-the-art domain generalization methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/Senyh/StyCona.

Abstract: We explore how scalable robot data can address real-world challenges for generalized robotic manipulation. Introducing AgiBot World, a large-scale platform comprising over 1 million trajectories across 217 tasks in five deployment scenarios, we achieve an order-of-magnitude increase in data scale compared to existing datasets. Accelerated by a standardized collection pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, AgiBot World guarantees high-quality and diverse data distribution. It is extensible from grippers to dexterous hands and visuo-tactile sensors for fine-grained skill acquisition. Building on top of data, we introduce Genie Operator-1 (GO-1), a novel generalist policy that leverages latent action representations to maximize data utilization, demonstrating predictable performance scaling with increased data volume. Policies pre-trained on our dataset achieve an average performance improvement of 30% over those trained on Open X-Embodiment, both in in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios. GO-1 exhibits exceptional capability in real-world dexterous and long-horizon tasks, achieving over 60% success rate on complex tasks and outperforming prior RDT approach by 32%. By open-sourcing the dataset, tools, and models, we aim to democratize access to large-scale, high-quality robot data, advancing the pursuit of scalable and general-purpose intelligence.

<title>SEAL: Semantic Aware Image Watermarking</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2503.12172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models have rapidly evolved to generate realistic outputs. However, their synthetic outputs increasingly challenge the clear distinction between natural and AI-generated content, necessitating robust watermarking techniques. Watermarks are typically expected to preserve the integrity of the target image, withstand removal attempts, and prevent unauthorized replication onto unrelated images. To address this need, recent methods embed persistent watermarks into images produced by diffusion models using the initial noise. Yet, to do so, they either distort the distribution of generated images or rely on searching through a long dictionary of used keys for detection.
  In this paper, we propose a novel watermarking method that embeds semantic information about the generated image directly into the watermark, enabling a distortion-free watermark that can be verified without requiring a database of key patterns. Instead, the key pattern can be inferred from the semantic embedding of the image using locality-sensitive hashing. Furthermore, conditioning the watermark detection on the original image content improves robustness against forgery attacks. To demonstrate that, we consider two largely overlooked attack strategies: (i) an attacker extracting the initial noise and generating a novel image with the same pattern; (ii) an attacker inserting an unrelated (potentially harmful) object into a watermarked image, possibly while preserving the watermark. We empirically validate our method's increased robustness to these attacks. Taken together, our results suggest that content-aware watermarks can mitigate risks arising from image-generative models.

<title>Dynamic-Dark SLAM: RGB-Thermal Cooperative Robot Vision Strategy for Multi-Person Tracking in Both Well-Lit and Low-Light Scenes</title>

Abstract: In robot vision, thermal cameras hold great potential for recognizing humans even in complete darkness. However, their application to multi-person tracking (MPT) has been limited due to data scarcity and the inherent difficulty of distinguishing individuals. In this study, we propose a cooperative MPT system that utilizes co-located RGB and thermal cameras, where pseudo-annotations (bounding boxes and person IDs) are used to train both RGB and thermal trackers. Evaluation experiments demonstrate that the thermal tracker performs robustly in both bright and dark environments. Moreover, the results suggest that a tracker-switching strategy -- guided by a binary brightness classifier -- is more effective for information integration than a tracker-fusion approach. As an application example, we present an image change pattern recognition (ICPR) method, the ``human-as-landmark,'' which combines two key properties: the thermal recognizability of humans in dark environments and the rich landmark characteristics -- appearance, geometry, and semantics -- of static objects (occluders). Whereas conventional SLAM focuses on mapping static landmarks in well-lit environments, the present study takes a first step toward a new Human-Only SLAM paradigm, ``Dynamic-Dark SLAM,'' which aims to map even dynamic landmarks in complete darkness. Additionally, this study demonstrates that knowledge transfer between thermal and depth modalities enables reliable person tracking using low-resolution 3D LiDAR data without RGB input, contributing an important advance toward cross-robot SLAM systems.

Abstract: Recent studies generally enhance MLLMs' reasoning capabilities via supervised fine-tuning on high-quality chain-of-thought reasoning data, which often leads models to merely imitate successful reasoning paths without understanding what the wrong reasoning paths are. In this work, we aim to enhance the MLLMs' reasoning ability beyond passively imitating positive reasoning paths. To this end, we design Step-wise Group Relative Policy Optimization (StepGRPO), a new online reinforcement learning framework that enables MLLMs to self-improve reasoning ability via simple, effective and dense step-wise rewarding. Specifically, StepGRPO introduces two novel rule-based reasoning rewards: Step-wise Reasoning Accuracy Reward (StepRAR) and Step-wise Reasoning Validity Reward (StepRVR). StepRAR rewards the reasoning paths that contain necessary intermediate reasoning steps via a soft key-step matching technique, while StepRAR rewards reasoning paths that follow a well-structured and logically consistent reasoning process through a reasoning completeness and logic evaluation strategy. With the proposed StepGRPO, we introduce R1-VL, a series of MLLMs with outstanding capabilities in step-by-step reasoning. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our methods.

Abstract: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) technology has recently achieved photorealistic mapping capabilities thanks to the real-time, high-fidelity rendering enabled by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, due to the static representation of scenes, current 3DGS-based SLAM encounters issues with pose drift and failure to reconstruct accurate maps in dynamic environments. To address this problem, we present D4DGS-SLAM, the first SLAM method based on 4DGS map representation for dynamic environments. By incorporating the temporal dimension into scene representation, D4DGS-SLAM enables high-quality reconstruction of dynamic scenes. Utilizing the dynamics-aware InfoModule, we can obtain the dynamics, visibility, and reliability of scene points, and filter out unstable dynamic points for tracking accordingly. When optimizing Gaussian points, we apply different isotropic regularization terms to Gaussians with varying dynamic characteristics. Experimental results on real-world dynamic scene datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both camera pose tracking and map quality.

arXiv:2505.03510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a paradigm for reservoir computing (RC) that leverages a pool of cultured biological neurons as the reservoir substrate, creating a biological reservoir computing (BRC). This system operates similarly to an echo state network (ESN), with the key distinction that the neural activity is generated by a network of cultured neurons, rather than being modeled by traditional artificial computational units. The neuronal activity is recorded using a multi-electrode array (MEA), which enables high-throughput recording of neural signals. In our approach, inputs are introduced into the network through a subset of the MEA electrodes, while the remaining electrodes capture the resulting neural activity. This generates a nonlinear mapping of the input data to a high-dimensional biological feature space, where distinguishing between data becomes more efficient and straightforward, allowing a simple linear classifier to perform pattern recognition tasks effectively. To evaluate the performance of our proposed system, we present an experimental study that includes various input patterns, such as positional codes, bars with different orientations, and a digit recognition task. The results demonstrate the feasibility of using biological neural networks to perform tasks traditionally handled by artificial neural networks, paving the way for further exploration of biologically-inspired computing systems, with potential applications in neuromorphic engineering and bio-hybrid computing.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in realistic voice cloning (VC), while they also increase the risk of malicious misuse. Existing proactive defenses designed for traditional VC models aim to disrupt the forgery process, but they have been proven incompatible with DMs due to the intricate generative mechanisms of diffusion. To bridge this gap, we introduce VoiceCloak, a multi-dimensional proactive defense framework with the goal of obfuscating speaker identity and degrading perceptual quality in potential unauthorized VC. To achieve these goals, we conduct a focused analysis to identify specific vulnerabilities within DMs, allowing VoiceCloak to disrupt the cloning process by introducing adversarial perturbations into the reference audio. Specifically, to obfuscate speaker identity, VoiceCloak first targets speaker identity by distorting representation learning embeddings to maximize identity variation, which is guided by auditory perception principles. Additionally, VoiceCloak disrupts crucial conditional guidance processes, particularly attention context, thereby preventing the alignment of vocal characteristics that are essential for achieving convincing cloning. Then, to address the second objective, VoiceCloak introduces score magnitude amplification to actively steer the reverse trajectory away from the generation of high-quality speech. Noise-guided semantic corruption is further employed to disrupt structural speech semantics captured by DMs, degrading output quality. Extensive experiments highlight VoiceCloak's outstanding defense success rate against unauthorized diffusion-based voice cloning. Audio samples of VoiceCloak are available at https://voice-cloak.github.io/VoiceCloak/.

Abstract: Accurately tracking particles and determining their coordinate along the optical axis is a major challenge in optical microscopy, especially when extremely high precision is needed. In this study, we introduce a deep learning approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can determine axial coordinates from dual-focal-plane images without relying on predefined models. Our method achieves an axial localization precision of 40 nanometers-six times better than traditional single-focal-plane techniques. The model's simple design and strong performance make it suitable for a wide range of uses, including dark matter detection, proton therapy for cancer, and radiation protection in space. It also shows promise in fields like biological imaging, materials science, and environmental monitoring. This work highlights how machine learning can turn complex image data into reliable, precise information, offering a flexible and powerful tool for many scientific applications.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) has historically relied on model-centric scaling through increasing parameter counts from millions to hundreds of billions to drive performance gains. However, as we approach hardware limits on model size, the dominant computational bottleneck has fundamentally shifted to the quadratic cost of self-attention over long token sequences, now driven by ultra-long text contexts, high-resolution images, and extended videos. In this position paper, \textbf{we argue that the focus of research for efficient AI is shifting from model-centric compression to data-centric compression}. We position token compression as the new frontier, which improves AI efficiency via reducing the number of tokens during model training or inference. Through comprehensive analysis, we first examine recent developments in long-context AI across various domains and establish a unified mathematical framework for existing model efficiency strategies, demonstrating why token compression represents a crucial paradigm shift in addressing long-context overhead. Subsequently, we systematically review the research landscape of token compression, analyzing its fundamental benefits and identifying its compelling advantages across diverse scenarios. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of current challenges in token compression research and outline promising future directions. Ultimately, our work aims to offer a fresh perspective on AI efficiency, synthesize existing research, and catalyze innovative developments to address the challenges that increasing context lengths pose to the AI community's advancement.

Abstract: Accurate placental segmentation is essential for quantitative analysis of the placenta. However, this task is particularly challenging in T2*-weighted placental imaging due to: (1) weak and inconsistent boundary contrast across individual echoes; (2) the absence of manual ground truth annotations for all echo times; and (3) motion artifacts across echoes caused by fetal and maternal movement. In this work, we propose a contrast-augmented segmentation framework that leverages complementary information across multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI to learn robust, contrast-invariant representations. Our method integrates: (i) masked autoencoding (MAE) for self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled multi-echo slices; (ii) masked pseudo-labeling (MPL) for unsupervised domain adaptation across echo times; and (iii) global-local collaboration to align fine-grained features with global anatomical context. We further introduce a semantic matching loss to encourage representation consistency across echoes of the same subject. Experiments on a clinical multi-echo placental MRI dataset demonstrate that our approach generalizes effectively across echo times and outperforms both single-echo and naive fusion baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically exploit multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI for placental segmentation.

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability, vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning, especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface, allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual information gathered from the external tool.

Abstract: Conventional voice conversion modifies voice characteristics from a source speaker to a target speaker, relying on audio input from both sides. However, this process becomes infeasible when clean audio is unavailable, such as in silent videos or noisy environments. In this work, we focus on the task of Silent Face-based Voice Conversion (SFVC), which does voice conversion entirely from visual inputs. i.e., given images of a target speaker and a silent video of a source speaker containing lip motion, SFVC generates speech aligning the identity of the target speaker while preserving the speech content in the source silent video. As this task requires generating intelligible speech and converting identity using only visual cues, it is particularly challenging. To address this, we introduce MuteSwap, a novel framework that employs contrastive learning to align cross-modality identities and minimize mutual information to separate shared visual features. Experimental results show that MuteSwap achieves impressive performance in both speech synthesis and identity conversion, especially under noisy conditions where methods dependent on audio input fail to produce intelligible results, demonstrating both the effectiveness of our training approach and the feasibility of SFVC.

Abstract: Colorectal polyp segmentation is critical for early detection of colorectal cancer, yet weak and low contrast boundaries significantly limit automated accuracy. Existing deep models either blur fine edge details or rely on handcrafted filters that perform poorly under variable imaging conditions. We propose MEGANet-W, a Wavelet Driven Edge Guided Attention Network that injects directional, parameter free Haar wavelet edge maps into each decoder stage to recalibrate semantic features. The key novelties of MEGANet-W include a two-level Haar wavelet head for multi-orientation edge extraction; and Wavelet Edge Guided Attention (W-EGA) modules that fuse wavelet cues with boundary and input branches. On five public polyp datasets, MEGANet-W consistently outperforms existing methods, improving mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, while introducing no additional learnable parameters. This approach improves reliability in difficult cases and offers a robust solution for medical image segmentation tasks requiring precise boundary detection.

<div> Keywords: Autonomous vehicles, Point cloud data, Object counting, Querying, CounterNet

Summary:
CounterNet is introduced to accurately count objects in large-scale point cloud data, addressing the limitations of existing detection models. The network focuses on detecting object presence by finding object centers, improving counting accuracy. A feature map partitioning strategy with overlapping regions enables better handling of objects in complex traffic scenes. A per-frame dynamic model selection strategy adapts to varying frame characteristics, selecting the most effective configuration for each input. Evaluations on real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories. This enhancement results in more reliable query outcomes for three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, essential for tasks such as collision detection, traffic analysis, and congestion monitoring. <div>

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles generate massive volumes of point cloud data, yet only a subset is relevant for specific tasks such as collision detection, traffic analysis, or congestion monitoring. Effectively querying this data is essential to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data, state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories, resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework, Quality-guided Mixture of score-fusion Experts (QME), aimed at improving whole-body biometric recognition performance through a learnable score-fusion strategy using a Mixture of Experts (MoE). This approach addresses the limitations of traditional unimodal systems by integrating multiple biometric modalities such as face, gait, and body. QME incorporates a quality estimator to assess the modality-specific quality and a score triplet loss to enhance metric performance. The proposed method demonstrates its effectiveness in various whole-body biometric datasets by achieving state-of-the-art results across different metrics compared to baseline methods. QME successfully overcomes challenges such as model misalignment in similarity score domain and data quality variability, making it a promising solution for multimodal and multi-model biometric recognition tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Whole-body biometric recognition is a challenging multimodal task that integrates various biometric modalities, including face, gait, and body. This integration is essential for overcoming the limitations of unimodal systems. Traditionally, whole-body recognition involves deploying different models to process multiple modalities, achieving the final outcome by score-fusion (e.g., weighted averaging of similarity matrices from each model). However, these conventional methods may overlook the variations in score distributions of individual modalities, making it challenging to improve final performance. In this work, we present \textbf{Q}uality-guided \textbf{M}ixture of score-fusion \textbf{E}xperts (QME), a novel framework designed for improving whole-body biometric recognition performance through a learnable score-fusion strategy using a Mixture of Experts (MoE). We introduce a novel pseudo-quality loss for quality estimation with a modality-specific Quality Estimator (QE), and a score triplet loss to improve the metric performance. Extensive experiments on multiple whole-body biometric datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results across various metrics compared to baseline methods. Our method is effective for multimodal and multi-model, addressing key challenges such as model misalignment in the similarity score domain and variability in data quality.

Summary:
Multimodal models struggle more with fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones. The bias-free Syn-TA dataset proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing greater performance drops in controlled settings. Larger models improve transferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal reasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization. The study explores how disentangling coarse and fine motions can enhance recognition in temporally challenging datasets. This research introduces a crucial benchmark for evaluating motion transferability in action recognition. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Action recognition models demonstrate strong generalization, but can they effectively transfer high-level motion concepts across diverse contexts, even within similar distributions? For example, can a model recognize the broad action "punching" when presented with an unseen variation such as "punching person"? To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with three datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2) Kinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural video datasets. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks and observe a significant drop in performance when recognizing high-level actions in novel contexts. Our analysis reveals: 1) Multimodal models struggle more with fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones; 2) The bias-free Syn-TA proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing greater performance drops in controlled settings; 3) Larger models improve transferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal reasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization. We further explore how disentangling coarse and fine motions can improve recognition in temporally challenging datasets. We believe this study establishes a crucial benchmark for assessing motion transferability in action recognition. Datasets and relevant code: https://github.com/raiyaan-abdullah/Motion-Transfer.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces the Monado SLAM dataset aimed at addressing the limitations of existing tracking systems for head-mounted sensors in humanoid robots and mixed reality headsets. While advancements in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have improved tracking, challenges such as high-intensity motions, dynamic occlusions, and adverse lighting conditions still pose difficulties. Existing datasets may not adequately cover these real-world issues, prompting the creation of the Monado SLAM dataset. Real sequences from multiple virtual reality headsets are included in the dataset, released under a permissive CC BY 4.0 license to drive further research and development in VIO/SLAM technology. This dataset aims to facilitate progress in tackling challenging scenarios like long tracking sessions and low-textured areas, which are vital for enhancing the performance of head-mounted tracking systems. <div>

Abstract: Humanoid robots and mixed reality headsets benefit from the use of head-mounted sensors for tracking. While advancements in visual-inertial odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have produced new and high-quality state-of-the-art tracking systems, we show that these are still unable to gracefully handle many of the challenging settings presented in the head-mounted use cases. Common scenarios like high-intensity motions, dynamic occlusions, long tracking sessions, low-textured areas, adverse lighting conditions, saturation of sensors, to name a few, continue to be covered poorly by existing datasets in the literature. In this way, systems may inadvertently overlook these essential real-world issues. To address this, we present the Monado SLAM dataset, a set of real sequences taken from multiple virtual reality headsets. We release the dataset under a permissive CC BY 4.0 license, to drive advancements in VIO/SLAM research and development.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Gender classification has emerged as a crucial aspect in various fields, including security, human-machine interaction, surveillance, and advertising. Nonetheless, the accuracy of this classification can be influenced by factors such as cosmetics and disguise. Consequently, our study is dedicated to addressing this concern by concentrating on gender classification using color images of the periocular region. The periocular region refers to the area surrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyebrows, and the region between them. It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features for gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the effectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate the model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL and (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding accuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a commendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters (7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset. To ascertain the effectiveness of our proposed model for gender classification using the periocular region, we evaluated its performance through an extensive range of metrics and compared it with other state-of-the-art approaches. The results unequivocally demonstrate the efficacy of our model, thereby suggesting its potential for practical application in domains such as security and surveillance.

<div> evaluation metric, generative video models, World Consistency Score, internal world consistency, video coherence<br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a new evaluation metric called World Consistency Score (WCS) for generative video models. WCS focuses on internal world consistency in generated videos by incorporating four sub-components: object permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty. These components measure various aspects of temporal and physical coherence in videos. WCS combines these submetrics through a learned weighted formula to produce a single consistency score aligned with human judgments. The article details the motivation for WCS, the computation of each submetric using open-source tools, and the training of weights using human preference data. An experimental validation plan is outlined, which involves testing WCS's correlation with human evaluations, sensitivity analyses, and comparing WCS against established metrics like FVD, CLIPScore, VBench, and FVMD. The proposed WCS offers a comprehensive and interpretable framework for evaluating video generation models based on their ability to maintain a coherent "world" over time, addressing gaps in existing metrics. <br /> <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce World Consistency Score (WCS), a novel unified evaluation metric for generative video models that emphasizes internal world consistency of the generated videos. WCS integrates four interpretable sub-components - object permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty - each measuring a distinct aspect of temporal and physical coherence in a video. These submetrics are combined via a learned weighted formula to produce a single consistency score that aligns with human judgments. We detail the motivation for WCS in the context of existing video evaluation metrics, formalize each submetric and how it is computed with open-source tools (trackers, action recognizers, CLIP embeddings, optical flow), and describe how the weights of the WCS combination are trained using human preference data. We also outline an experimental validation blueprint: using benchmarks like VBench-2.0, EvalCrafter, and LOVE to test WCS's correlation with human evaluations, performing sensitivity analyses, and comparing WCS against established metrics (FVD, CLIPScore, VBench, FVMD). The proposed WCS offers a comprehensive and interpretable framework for evaluating video generation models on their ability to maintain a coherent "world" over time, addressing gaps left by prior metrics focused only on visual fidelity or prompt alignment.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces GeoExplorer, an agent for Active Geo-localization (AGL) that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards. Unlike traditional methods that rely on distance-based rewards, GeoExplorer's goal-agnostic approach enables robust and diverse exploration in various environments. By effectively modeling the environment, GeoExplorer demonstrates improved generalization and robustness in localizing unfamiliar targets. The agent's capabilities are validated through experiments on four AGL benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in various settings. By emphasizing curiosity-driven exploration, GeoExplorer offers a more reliable exploration strategy and enhances the agent's ability to localize goals accurately. This innovative approach has the potential to address challenges in distance estimation and improve performance in challenging AGL tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.00152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Geo-localization (AGL) is the task of localizing a goal, represented in various modalities (e.g., aerial images, ground-level images, or text), within a predefined search area. Current methods approach AGL as a goal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL) problem with a distance-based reward. They localize the goal by implicitly learning to minimize the relative distance from it. However, when distance estimation becomes challenging or when encountering unseen targets and environments, the agent exhibits reduced robustness and generalization ability due to the less reliable exploration strategy learned during training. In this paper, we propose GeoExplorer, an AGL agent that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards. Unlike distance-based rewards, our curiosity-driven reward is goal-agnostic, enabling robust, diverse, and contextually relevant exploration based on effective environment modeling. These capabilities have been proven through extensive experiments across four AGL benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization ability of GeoExplorer in diverse settings, particularly in localizing unfamiliar targets and environments.

<div> Keywords: LiDAR, 3D sensors, point clouds, uncertainty, 3D object detection

Summary: 
Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC) is proposed as a novel 3D scene representation, enhancing each point with a probability attribute to capture measurement uncertainty. By incorporating the uncertainty information from raw LiDAR measurements into the point cloud construction, PPC improves robustness in downstream perception models. Inference approaches using PPC for 3D object detection demonstrate superior performance compared to conventional methods. These methods are lightweight and adaptable for integration into existing 3D processing pipelines. Simulations and real-world captures validate the effectiveness of PPC-based 3D inference methods in challenging scenarios like long-distance, low-albedo objects, and strong ambient light. The project webpage provides additional details on PPC and its applications. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D sensors provide point clouds, a canonical 3D representation used in various scene understanding tasks. Modern LiDARs face key challenges in several real-world scenarios, such as long-distance or low-albedo objects, producing sparse or erroneous point clouds. These errors, which are rooted in the noisy raw LiDAR measurements, get propagated to downstream perception models, resulting in potentially severe loss of accuracy. This is because conventional 3D processing pipelines do not retain any uncertainty information from the raw measurements when constructing point clouds.
  We propose Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a novel 3D scene representation where each point is augmented with a probability attribute that encapsulates the measurement uncertainty (or confidence) in the raw data. We further introduce inference approaches that leverage PPC for robust 3D object detection; these methods are versatile and can be used as computationally lightweight drop-in modules in 3D inference pipelines. We demonstrate, via both simulations and real captures, that PPC-based 3D inference methods outperform several baselines using LiDAR as well as camera-LiDAR fusion models, across challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios involving small, distant, and low-albedo objects, as well as strong ambient light.

Summary:
The study introduces Selective Modality Shifting (SMS) to quantify biases in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in binary classification tasks using medical imaging datasets. It assesses six VLMs, revealing a reliance on text input over visual cues, even when complementary visual information is available. The study finds a marked dependency on text details, overshadowing image content, highlighting the need for genuinely integrated multimodal medical models. The perturbation-based approach exposes modality-specific biases, showing a disparity between model performance and calibration in both unperturbed and perturbed settings. Qualitative attention-based analysis further confirms the dominance of text information over visual cues. The findings emphasize the significance of designing and evaluating medical models that truly integrate visual and textual inputs.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies on the integrated analysis of medical images and the associated clinical reports. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray) and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings, we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals.

Summary: 
Structured graph "lineages" are defined, growing hierarchically with exponential increases in vertices and edges. Bipartite graphs connect levels and constrain matrices, while prolongation maps create distance measures between levels. A category of graded graphs allows for skeletal variants of algebraic operations. Skeletal binary operators exhibit algebraic and category-theoretic properties similar to standard operators. Graph lineages and skeletal constructors can approach continuum limit objects. Unary operators for graded graphs—thickening and escalation—are derived for creating multiscale graphs and search frontiers. This algebraic type theory for graded graphs and hierarchies is well-suited for defining hierarchical model architectures and local algorithms, demonstrated for deep neural networks and multigrid methods. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the architecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning and computational science. Here we define structured graph "lineages" (ordered by level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number of graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2) bipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in multigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using prolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures between graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of "graded graphs" can be defined, and using it low-cost "skeletal" variants of standard algebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product, disjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence hierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar but not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard counterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can approach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on graded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of multiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers (useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining "skeletal" functions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and (hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to defining hierarchical model architectures - "hierarchitectures" - and local sampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them. We demonstrate such application to deep neural networks (including visual and feature scale spaces) and to multigrid numerical methods.

<div> Keywords: real personality recognition, expressive behaviours, cognitive simulation, graph neural network, end-to-end strategy

Summary: <br /><br />Automatic real personality recognition (RPR) aims to assess human real personality traits based on their expressive behaviours. Existing solutions often struggle to accurately infer real personalities from these behaviours, leading to subpar recognition performance. To address this issue, a novel approach is proposed that simulates personalized internal cognition from easily accessible external audio-visual behaviours of the target individual. This simulated cognition is represented as a graph structure using a 2D Graph Neural Network (2D-GNN) for personality trait inference. An end-to-end strategy is employed to jointly train the cognition simulation, graph construction, and personality recognition modules. By focusing on the association between real personality and internal cognition, this approach offers a more efficient and accurate way to recognize real personalities from expressive behaviours. <div>
arXiv:2508.00205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic real personality recognition (RPR) aims to evaluate human real personality traits from their expressive behaviours. However, most existing solutions generally act as external observers to infer observers' personality impressions based on target individuals' expressive behaviours, which significantly deviate from their real personalities and consistently lead to inferior recognition performance. Inspired by the association between real personality and human internal cognition underlying the generation of expressive behaviours, we propose a novel RPR approach that efficiently simulates personalised internal cognition from easy-accessible external short audio-visual behaviours expressed by the target individual. The simulated personalised cognition, represented as a set of network weights that enforce the personalised network to reproduce the individual-specific facial reactions, is further encoded as a novel graph containing two-dimensional node and edge feature matrices, with a novel 2D Graph Neural Network (2D-GNN) proposed for inferring real personality traits from it. To simulate real personality-related cognition, an end-to-end strategy is designed to jointly train our cognition simulation, 2D graph construction, and personality recognition modules.

This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach that utilizes frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings for semantic guidance in segmentation tasks. The Parallel-Text adapter design injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enhancing segmentation performance while keeping the original architecture mostly frozen. By modifying the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer block, the adapter preserves the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Experimental results on the COD10K dataset and subsets of COCO and ADE20K demonstrate improved segmentation performance when incorporating fixed text embeddings as input. This work represents the first instance of using text prompts for segmentation on the COD10K dataset, indicating the effectiveness of integrating semantic conditioning into SAM's architecture for efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive generalization in prompt-based segmentation. Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.

Summary:
In the domain of Few-Shot Image Classification where there is minimal data, dealing with image ambiguities caused by multiple objects or complex backgrounds can lead to performance degradation. This study demonstrates that incorporating information about the local positioning of objects in an image can significantly improve classification accuracy on standard benchmarks. Utilizing the Segment Anything Model or unsupervised foreground object extraction methods can achieve a notable portion of this improvement by simply highlighting a single pixel of the object of interest. By leveraging these techniques, classification performance can be enhanced even with limited training data, offering a promising avenue for improving few-shot image classification tasks. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: In the domain of Few-Shot Image Classification, operating with as little as one example per class, the presence of image ambiguities stemming from multiple objects or complex backgrounds can significantly deteriorate performance. Our research demonstrates that incorporating additional information about the local positioning of an object within its image markedly enhances classification across established benchmarks. More importantly, we show that a significant fraction of the improvement can be achieved through the use of the Segment Anything Model, requiring only a pixel of the object of interest to be pointed out, or by employing fully unsupervised foreground object extraction methods.

<div> Keywords: depth map super-resolution, convolutional neural network, transformer, multi-scale fusion, state space modeling

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel depth map super-resolution model, MSF-UM, that combines the efficiency of Mamba's state-space modeling with a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color image. By integrating a residual dense channel attention block and the Mamba state space module, the model can capture both local features and long-distance dependencies in depth maps. A multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy is employed to utilize high-frequency texture information from the color image for guiding the super-resolution process. The proposed MSF-UM outperforms existing methods by reducing the number of model parameters and achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the model's effectiveness and superior generalization ability, especially in large-scale depth map super-resolution tasks. <div>
arXiv:2508.00248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Depth map super-resolution technology aims to improve the spatial resolution of low-resolution depth maps and effectively restore high-frequency detail information. Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in dealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global contextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global dependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are quadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution depth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba (MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core innovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling capabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color image. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and the Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature extraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of the state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the model adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the high-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the super-resolution process of the depth map. Compared with existing mainstream methods, the proposed MSF-UM significantly reduces the number of model parameters while achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness of the model, especially showing excellent generalization ability in the task of large-scale depth map super-resolution.

PointGauss is a novel framework for efficient multi-object segmentation in Gaussian Splatting representations. The method utilizes a point cloud-based Gaussian primitive decoder to generate 3D instance masks quickly and a GPU-accelerated 2D mask rendering system for multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments show significant performance gains over existing methods in multi-view mIoU, with improved computational efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce PointGauss, a novel point cloud-guided framework for real-time multi-object segmentation in Gaussian Splatting representations. Unlike existing methods that suffer from prolonged initialization and limited multi-view consistency, our approach achieves efficient 3D segmentation by directly parsing Gaussian primitives through a point cloud segmentation-driven pipeline. The key innovation lies in two aspects: (1) a point cloud-based Gaussian primitive decoder that generates 3D instance masks within 1 minute, and (2) a GPU-accelerated 2D mask rendering system that ensures multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving performance gains of 1.89 to 31.78% in multi-view mIoU, while maintaining superior computational efficiency. To address the limitations of current benchmarks (single-object focus, inconsistent 3D evaluation, small scale, and partial coverage), we present DesktopObjects-360, a novel comprehensive dataset for 3D segmentation in radiance fields, featuring: (1) complex multi-object scenes, (2) globally consistent 2D annotations, (3) large-scale training data (over 27 thousand 2D masks), (4) full 360{\deg} coverage, and (5) 3D evaluation masks.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework for continual learning in generative vision-language models. It addresses the issue of neglecting language instructions in favor of visual inputs by proposing a mixture of visual projectors specialized in translating visual information based on instruction context. An expert recommendation strategy is utilized to reuse experts for similar tasks, and expert pruning is implemented to reduce interference from previous tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in generating instruction-following responses. <div>

Abstract: Continual learning enables pre-trained generative vision-language models (VLMs) to incorporate knowledge from new tasks without retraining data from previous ones. Recent methods update a visual projector to translate visual information for new tasks, connecting pre-trained vision encoders with large language models. However, such adjustments may cause the models to prioritize visual inputs over language instructions, particularly learning tasks with repetitive types of textual instructions. To address the neglect of language instructions, we propose a novel framework that grounds the translation of visual information on instructions for language models. We introduce a mixture of visual projectors, each serving as a specialized visual-to-language translation expert based on the given instruction context to adapt to new tasks. To avoid using experts for irrelevant instruction contexts, we propose an expert recommendation strategy that reuses experts for tasks similar to those previously learned. Additionally, we introduce expert pruning to alleviate interference from the use of experts that cumulatively activated in previous tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing continual learning approaches by generating instruction-following responses.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic correspondence aims to identify semantically meaningful relationships between different images and is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated. In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14 distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness, but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3) The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for task-specific designs. These results are consistent across both our dataset and real-world benchmarks.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is recognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However, detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to better extract key facial features and improve detection performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and reliable drowsiness detection.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video Diffusion Model (TITAN-Guide), a new approach to training-free conditioning for diffusion models. Unlike existing methods, TITAN-Guide effectively manages memory requirements and provides more optimal control in the guidance process. By optimizing diffusion latents without backpropagation from a guiding model, the approach improves T2V performance across various diffusion guidance benchmarks. The study focuses on forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks with different directional directives. TITAN-Guide demonstrates the ability to significantly enhance T2V performance while minimizing memory requirements, making it a valuable tool for tasks that require intense computation. The code, models, and demo for TITAN-Guide are available on their website for further exploration and implementation. <div>
arXiv:2508.00289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent development of conditional diffusion models still require heavy supervised fine-tuning for performing control on a category of tasks. Training-free conditioning via guidance with off-the-shelf models is a favorable alternative to avoid further fine-tuning on the base model. However, the existing training-free guidance frameworks either have heavy memory requirements or offer sub-optimal control due to rough estimation. These shortcomings limit the applicability to control diffusion models that require intense computation, such as Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models. In this work, we propose Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video Diffusion Model, so-called TITAN-Guide, which overcomes memory space issues, and provides more optimal control in the guidance process compared to the counterparts. In particular, we develop an efficient method for optimizing diffusion latents without backpropagation from a discriminative guiding model. In particular, we study forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks with various options on directional directives. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently managing memory during latent optimization, while previous methods fall short. Our proposed approach not only minimizes memory requirements but also significantly enhances T2V performance across a range of diffusion guidance benchmarks.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces AniMer+, an extension of the AniMer framework, which uses a high-capacity Vision Transformer (ViT) with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design to reconstruct mammals and birds. The model partitions network layers into species-specific and shared components, allowing for efficient learning of anatomical features. To address the lack of 3D training data for birds, a diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline was introduced, creating the CtrlAni3D and CtrlAVES3D synthetic datasets. Trained on a mixture of real and synthetic data, AniMer+ outperformed existing methods, including on the challenging Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of the novel network architecture and synthetic datasets in improving performance. <div>
arXiv:2508.00298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of foundation models, achieving a unified understanding of different dynamic objects through a single network has the potential to empower stronger spatial intelligence. Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer (ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves) and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection models in autonomous driving systems often lack robustness due to insufficient representation of dangerous pedestrian scenarios in training datasets. To address this limitation, we present a novel framework for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios by integrating video inpainting and human motion control techniques. Our approach begins by identifying pedestrian regions of interest across multiple camera views, expanding detection bounding boxes with a fixed ratio, and resizing and stitching these regions into a unified canvas while preserving cross-view spatial relationships. A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable area, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control conditions. This enables flexible editing functionalities, including pedestrian insertion, replacement, and removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with strong visual realism, spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency. These results establish the proposed method as a robust and versatile solution for multi-view pedestrian video generation, with broad potential for applications in data augmentation and scenario simulation in autonomous driving.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces a new approach for enhancing low-light images captured by event cameras. It decouples the enhancement pipeline into two stages: visibility restoration and structure refinement. The visibility restoration network incorporates amplitude-phase entanglement to improve image visibility. A fusion strategy is employed to refine image structure by aligning information from the frame and event data. Spatial-frequency interpolation is used to generate diverse negative samples for training, contributing to the development of a contrastive loss function that aids in learning discriminative representations. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to existing models. <div>
arXiv:2508.00308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The event camera, benefiting from its high dynamic range and low latency, provides performance gain for low-light image enhancement. Unlike frame-based cameras, it records intensity changes with extremely high temporal resolution, capturing sufficient structure information. Currently, existing event-based methods feed a frame and events directly into a single model without fully exploiting modality-specific advantages, which limits their performance. Therefore, by analyzing the role of each sensing modality, the enhancement pipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration and structure refinement. In the first stage, we design a visibility restoration network with amplitude-phase entanglement by rethinking the relationship between amplitude and phase components in Fourier space. In the second stage, a fusion strategy with dynamic alignment is proposed to mitigate the spatial mismatch caused by the temporal resolution discrepancy between two sensing modalities, aiming to refine the structure information of the image enhanced by the visibility restoration network. In addition, we utilize spatial-frequency interpolation to simulate negative samples with diverse illumination, noise and artifact degradations, thereby developing a contrastive loss that encourages the model to learn discriminative representations. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity, unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection (GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos. These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Sumutan/GV-VAD.git.

<div> Personalizing, text-to-image, diffusion models, fine-tuning, guidance<br />
Summary:<br />
Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting pre-trained models to specific target concepts. However, fine-tuning with few images can create a trade-off between aligning with the target distribution and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model. Existing sampling guidance methods have limitations in effectively guiding output towards a well-balanced space. To address these limitations, the proposed personalization guidance method leverages an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. This method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model through weight interpolation during inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which solely depend on guidance scales, this method explicitly steers outputs towards a balanced latent space without additional computational overhead. Experimental results show improved text alignment and target distribution fidelity, seamlessly integrating with various fine-tuning strategies.<br />  <div>
arXiv:2508.00319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting the pre-trained models to specific target concepts, enabling diverse image generation. However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent trade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject fidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text editability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free guidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output toward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target distribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these limitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method leveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. Moreover, our method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model through weight interpolation between pre-trained and fine-tuned models during inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which depend solely on guidance scales, our method explicitly steers the outputs toward a balanced latent space without additional computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed guidance can improve text alignment and target distribution fidelity, integrating seamlessly with various fine-tuning strategies.

Summary: 
This paper presents a novel calibration method for camera spectral sensitivity using a diffraction grating. The accurate calibration of camera spectral sensitivity is essential for tasks such as color correction, illumination estimation, and material analysis in computer vision. Unlike existing methods that rely on specialized filters or reference targets with known spectral reflectances, the proposed method utilizes an uncalibrated diffraction grating sheet that is easily accessible. By capturing images of direct illumination and its diffracted pattern through the grating sheet, the method can estimate both camera spectral sensitivity and diffraction grating parameters in a closed-form solution. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that this method outperforms traditional reference target-based approaches, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper introduces a practical and accurate calibration method for camera spectral sensitivity using a diffraction grating. Accurate calibration of camera spectral sensitivity is crucial for various computer vision tasks, including color correction, illumination estimation, and material analysis. Unlike existing approaches that require specialized narrow-band filters or reference targets with known spectral reflectances, our method only requires an uncalibrated diffraction grating sheet, readily available off-the-shelf. By capturing images of the direct illumination and its diffracted pattern through the grating sheet, our method estimates both the camera spectral sensitivity and the diffraction grating parameters in a closed-form manner. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional reference target-based methods, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: We present a Collaborative Agent-Based Framework for Multi-Image Reasoning. Our approach tackles the challenge of interleaved multimodal reasoning across diverse datasets and task formats by employing a dual-agent system: a language-based PromptEngineer, which generates context-aware, task-specific prompts, and a VisionReasoner, a large vision-language model (LVLM) responsible for final inference. The framework is fully automated, modular, and training-free, enabling generalization across classification, question answering, and free-form generation tasks involving one or multiple input images. We evaluate our method on 18 diverse datasets from the 2025 MIRAGE Challenge (Track A), covering a broad spectrum of visual reasoning tasks including document QA, visual comparison, dialogue-based understanding, and scene-level inference. Our results demonstrate that LVLMs can effectively reason over multiple images when guided by informative prompts. Notably, Claude 3.7 achieves near-ceiling performance on challenging tasks such as TQA (99.13% accuracy), DocVQA (96.87%), and MMCoQA (75.28 ROUGE-L). We also explore how design choices-such as model selection, shot count, and input length-influence the reasoning performance of different LVLMs.

<div> Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter, Multi-object tracking, ego-vehicle, dynamic scenarios, MotionScaleNet <br />
<br />Summary: 
The paper addresses the limitations of traditional tracking-by-detection methods in dynamic scenarios by introducing the Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF). SG-LKF takes into account ego-vehicle speed variations to improve tracking stability and accuracy. The model incorporates MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a network that predicts key parameters for SG-LKF. A self-supervised trajectory consistency loss is introduced to enhance inter-frame association and trajectory continuity. Experimental results show that SG-LKF achieves top performance on KITTI 2D MOT and KITTI 3D MOT datasets, as well as outperforming SimpleTrack on nuScenes 3D MOT. The proposed approach significantly improves tracking performance in highly dynamic scenarios by dynamically adapting uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed. <div>
arXiv:2508.00358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) enables autonomous vehicles to continuously perceive dynamic objects, supplying essential temporal cues for prediction, behavior understanding, and safe planning. However, conventional tracking-by-detection methods typically rely on static coordinate transformations based on ego-vehicle poses, disregarding ego-vehicle speed-induced variations in observation noise and reference frame changes, which degrades tracking stability and accuracy in dynamic, high-speed scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the critical role of ego-vehicle speed in MOT and propose a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) that dynamically adapts uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed, significantly improving stability and accuracy in highly dynamic scenarios. Central to SG-LKF is MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a decoupled token-mixing and channel-mixing MLP that adaptively predicts key parameters of SG-LKF. To enhance inter-frame association and trajectory continuity, we introduce a self-supervised trajectory consistency loss jointly optimized with semantic and positional constraints. Extensive experiments show that SG-LKF ranks first among all vision-based methods on KITTI 2D MOT with 79.59% HOTA, delivers strong results on KITTI 3D MOT with 82.03% HOTA, and outperforms SimpleTrack by 2.2% AMOTA on nuScenes 3D MOT.

<div> Keywords: collaborative perception, spatio-temporal space, feature fusion, efficiency, accuracy

Summary: 
Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) is introduced as an efficient approach for aggregating observations from multiple agents and different time instances into a unified spatio-temporal space simultaneously. By integrating multi-agent fusion and multi-time fusion into a unified spatial-temporal aggregation, CoST offers benefits of efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. This new method eliminates the need for re-transmitting object features multiple times, as each static object only requires transmission once in the spatial-temporal space. The holistic perspective provided by the unified space enhances perception performance in challenging scenarios. CoST is compatible with various existing methods and enhances their accuracy while reducing transmission bandwidth. Overall, CoST improves efficiency and accuracy in collaborative perception tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative perception shares information among different agents and helps solving problems that individual agents may face, e.g., occlusions and small sensing range. Prior methods usually separate the multi-agent fusion and multi-time fusion into two consecutive steps. In contrast, this paper proposes an efficient collaborative perception that aggregates the observations from different agents (space) and different times into a unified spatio-temporal space simultanesouly. The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits, i.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient feature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the spatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas prior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior feature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified spatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby enhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios. Consequently, our Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) gains improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Notably, CoST is not tied to any specific method and is compatible with a majority of previous methods, enhancing their accuracy while reducing the transmission bandwidth.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method for automatically classifying honey botanical origins. Dataset preparation, feature extraction, and classification are the three main steps of the proposed method. We use a class transformation method in the dataset preparation phase to maximize the separability across classes. The feature extraction phase employs the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique for extracting relevant features and reducing the number of dimensions. In the classification phase, we use Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to classify the extracted features of honey samples into their botanical origins. We evaluate our system using a standard honey hyperspectral imaging (HSI) dataset. Experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed system produces state-of-the-art results on this dataset, achieving the highest classification accuracy of 95.13% for hyperspectral image-based classification and 92.80% for hyperspectral instance-based classification.

<div> Neural implicit reconstruction, sparse views, feature consistency, uncertainty-guided depth constraint, high-quality geometry<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
SparseRecon is a new neural implicit reconstruction method designed for reconstructing 3D shapes or scenes from sparse RGB images. The method addresses issues faced by current methods, such as poor generalization and limited reconstruction quality due to insufficient geometry clues. SparseRecon utilizes a volume rendering-based feature consistency approach to ensure completeness and smoothness in the reconstruction results. Additionally, an uncertainty-guided depth constraint is employed to recover geometry details in areas with occlusion and insignificant features, leading to improved reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that SparseRecon outperforms existing methods, particularly in scenarios with small overlapping views. The method's project page provides further information and demonstrates the superiority of SparseRecon in producing high-quality geometry from sparse-view inputs. <div>
arXiv:2508.00366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface reconstruction from sparse views aims to reconstruct a 3D shape or scene from few RGB images. The latest methods are either generalization-based or overfitting-based. However, the generalization-based methods do not generalize well on views that were unseen during training, while the reconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the limited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel neural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume rendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint. Firstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the neural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by insufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and smoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an uncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in areas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry details for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce high-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with small overlapping views.

Summary: 
Representation Shift introduces a training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the extent of change in a token's representation. This metric seamlessly integrates token compression techniques with FlashAttention, a fused attention kernel that reduces memory overhead by eliminating the need for attention map construction. The method is applicable to Transformers, CNNs, and state space models, enabling effective token compression without attention maps or retraining. Experimental results demonstrate significant speedups of up to 5.5% and 4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA tasks, respectively. The proposed approach provides a solution to the increasing computation cost of self-attention in complex tasks, offering a practical method to enhance efficiency in various models. The code implementation is available on GitHub for further exploration and utilization. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across vision, language, and video. Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more tokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU memory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has proposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative tokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been developed to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction and its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most training-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to determine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each token's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with FlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further generalizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive experiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression compatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5% and 4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively.

Summary:
BiAnt is a new method for video-based long-term action anticipation that improves performance by combining forward and backward prediction using a large language model.

Abstract: Video-based long-term action anticipation is crucial for early risk detection in areas such as automated driving and robotics. Conventional approaches extract features from past actions using encoders and predict future events with decoders, which limits performance due to their unidirectional nature. These methods struggle to capture semantically distinct sub-actions within a scene. The proposed method, BiAnt, addresses this limitation by combining forward prediction with backward prediction using a large language model. Experimental results on Ego4D demonstrate that BiAnt improves performance in terms of edit distance compared to baseline methods.

arXiv:2508.00381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights. Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA) framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals. Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore and marine environments.

Summary: <br />
Spatial transcriptomics enables precision oncology by revealing gene expression patterns in tissue context. Predicting spatial gene expression from histopathology images is a cost-effective alternative, but current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology using Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones fall short of clinical standards. To address this, a new hybrid backbone architecture, $MV_{Hybrid}$, combining state space models with ViT is proposed. Pretrained on colorectal cancer datasets using self-supervised learning, $MV_{Hybrid}$ outperforms ViT in gene expression prediction, showing superior performance and robustness. It also exhibits promising results in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks, positioning it as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. The code for $MV_{Hybrid}$ is publicly available for further research and development. <div>

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption. Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models (VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce $MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models (SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction, demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore, $MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification, patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/deepnoid-ai/MVHybrid.

Summary:<br />
This study introduces a collaborative multi-agent system, Cued-Agent, for Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR). The system integrates four specialized sub-agents to decode hand movements and lip features, dynamically integrate hand prompts with lip features, and enable post-processing for phoneme-to-word conversion. The system was tested on a mixed dataset of fourteen subjects, including both normal and hearing-impaired cuers. Experimental results show that Cued-Agent outperforms existing methods in both scenarios. The implementation is available on GitHub for further exploration.

The proposed collaborative approach shows promising capabilities for effective ACSR in real-world applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at https://github.com/DennisHgj/Cued-Agent.

<div> Keywords: Prompt tuning, visual-language models, information asymmetry, decouple-before-align, few-shot learning

Summary:<br /><br />
This paper introduces DAPT, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to address information asymmetry issues in vision-language models. By decoupling the visual modality into foreground and background representations and aligning them with corresponding textual prompts, DAPT ensures unbiased attention and strengthens modal alignment. Additionally, a visual pull-push regularization mechanism is proposed to enhance visual concentration on the region-of-interest object. The effectiveness of DAPT is demonstrated through improved performance in few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient learning tasks across various benchmarks. The DAPT framework is architecture-free and outperforms existing methods in enhancing task-specific transferability of vision-language models. The code for implementing DAPT is available at the provided GitHub repository. <div>
arXiv:2508.00395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt tuning (PT), as an emerging resource-efficient fine-tuning paradigm, has showcased remarkable effectiveness in improving the task-specific transferability of vision-language models. This paper delves into a previously overlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly conveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality. Correspondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the biased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To address this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive decouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the visual modality into the foreground and background representation via exploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these decoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the hand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal alignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual pull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns, directing the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the region-of-interest object. We demonstrate the power of architecture-free DAPT through few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient learning, all of which yield superior performance across prevailing benchmarks. Our code will be released at https://github.com/Ferenas/DAPT.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel detection framework for identifying forged videos generated by advanced diffusion-based models. The proposed approach combines RGB appearance features with optical flow residuals to effectively detect both appearance-level artifacts and subtle motion anomalies.

arXiv:2508.00397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based video generation models has led to increasingly realistic synthetic content, presenting new challenges for video forgery detection. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained temporal inconsistencies, particularly in AI-generated videos with high visual fidelity and coherent motion. In this work, we propose a detection framework that leverages spatial-temporal consistency by combining RGB appearance features with optical flow residuals. The model adopts a dual-branch architecture, where one branch analyzes RGB frames to detect appearance-level artifacts, while the other processes flow residuals to reveal subtle motion anomalies caused by imperfect temporal synthesis. By integrating these complementary features, the proposed method effectively detects a wide range of forged videos. Extensive experiments on text-to-video and image-to-video tasks across ten diverse generative models demonstrate the robustness and strong generalization ability of the proposed approach.

<div> Keywords: Vision-language models, industrial environments, iSafetyBench, hazardous activities, multimodal models

Summary: 
Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown success in diverse video understanding tasks, but their performance in industrial environments, where recognizing routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is crucial, is limited. To address this gap, a new benchmark called iSafetyBench has been introduced, specifically designed for evaluating model performance in industrial settings. The benchmark consists of 1,100 video clips from real-world industrial contexts, annotated with action tags covering routine and hazardous actions. Multiple-choice questions are provided for evaluating single-label and multi-label scenarios, revealing performance gaps in existing VLMs, particularly in recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label contexts. This highlights the need for more robust, safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. The iSafetyBench dataset is available for further research and development in this area.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive generalization across diverse video understanding tasks under zero-shot settings. However, their capabilities in high-stakes industrial domains-where recognizing both routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is essential-remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce iSafetyBench, a new video-language benchmark specifically designed to evaluate model performance in industrial environments across both normal and hazardous scenarios. iSafetyBench comprises 1,100 video clips sourced from real-world industrial settings, annotated with open-vocabulary, multi-label action tags spanning 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories. Each clip is paired with multiple-choice questions for both single-label and multi-label evaluation, enabling fine-grained assessment of VLMs in both standard and safety-critical contexts. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art video-language models under zero-shot conditions. Despite their strong performance on existing video benchmarks, these models struggle with iSafetyBench-particularly in recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label scenarios. Our results reveal significant performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust, safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. iSafetyBench provides a first-of-its-kind testbed to drive progress in this direction.

Summary:
The article introduces a Dynamic Efficiency Index (DEI) to quantify video dynamic intensity in varying turbulence conditions and creates a high-dynamic turbulence training dataset. A Physical Model-Driven Multi-Stage Video Restoration (PMR) framework is proposed, consisting of de-tilting for geometric stabilization, motion segmentation enhancement for dynamic region refinement, and de-blurring for quality restoration. PMR utilizes lightweight backbones and stage-wise joint training for efficiency and high restoration quality.

Abstract: Geometric distortions and blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence degrade the quality of long-range dynamic scene videos. Existing methods struggle with restoring edge details and eliminating mixed distortions, especially under conditions of strong turbulence and complex dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce a Dynamic Efficiency Index ($DEI$), which combines turbulence intensity, optical flow, and proportions of dynamic regions to accurately quantify video dynamic intensity under varying turbulence conditions and provide a high-dynamic turbulence training dataset. Additionally, we propose a Physical Model-Driven Multi-Stage Video Restoration ($PMR$) framework that consists of three stages: \textbf{de-tilting} for geometric stabilization, \textbf{motion segmentation enhancement} for dynamic region refinement, and \textbf{de-blurring} for quality restoration. $PMR$ employs lightweight backbones and stage-wise joint training to ensure both efficiency and high restoration quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses motion trailing artifacts, restores edge details and exhibits strong generalization capability, especially in real-world scenarios characterized by high-turbulence and complex dynamics. We will make the code and datasets openly available.

Sortblock is a training-free inference acceleration framework designed to improve the efficiency of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) by dynamically caching block-wise features based on their similarity across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock can determine a recomputation ratio, allowing for the selective skipping of redundant computations while maintaining generation quality. Additionally, Sortblock incorporates a lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped blocks. Experimental results across various tasks and DiT architectures show that Sortblock can achieve over 2x inference speedup with minimal degradation in output quality.

arXiv:2508.00412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that enhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential denoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment in real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches typically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking the evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To address this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration framework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock adaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant computations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped blocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures demonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\times$ inference speedup with minimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

Summary:<br />
The article introduces DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders designed for high-resolution diffusion models. It addresses the issue of slow convergence in diffusion models when increasing the latent channel number, which can lead to a trade-off between reconstruction and generation quality. DC-AE 1.5 introduces two key innovations to overcome this challenge: Structured Latent Space, which imposes a desired channel-wise structure on the latent space for better object structure and image detail capture, and Augmented Diffusion Training, a strategy that enhances convergence by adding diffusion training objectives on object latent channels. With these techniques, DC-AE 1.5 achieves faster convergence and improved diffusion scaling results compared to its predecessor, DC-AE. In experiments on ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE 1.5 outperforms DC-AE in image generation quality while also being four times faster. <div>

Abstract: We present DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders for high-resolution diffusion models. Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel number is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality. However, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer generation quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the quality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key innovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a training-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the latent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter latent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an augmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training objectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these techniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling results than DC-AE. On ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE-1.5-f64c128 delivers better image generation quality than DC-AE-f32c32 while being 4x faster. Code: https://github.com/dc-ai-projects/DC-Gen.

<div> object flow learning, video outpainting, inpainting models, discriminator designs, adversarial training

Summary:
This paper introduces a method for enhancing video outpainting by utilizing object flow learning from inpainting models. The traditional fine-tuning approach for inpainting models in outpainting tasks often results in blurry outputs. The key improvement proposed is the use of a hierarchical discriminator that focuses on both global and local objectives in assessing outpainted areas. A specialized outpainting loss function leverages features from the discriminator to enhance the generator's ability to create visually appealing and globally coherent outpainted scenes. Through extensive experiments and comparisons, the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively. The supplementary materials, including a demo video and code, are available for further exploration. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video outpainting presents a unique challenge of extending the borders while maintaining consistency with the given content. In this paper, we suggest the use of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and reconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as in existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting models to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry results. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a critical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a discriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the extended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of adversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical discriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a specialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global features of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function enhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and globally coherent outpainted scenes. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Supplementary materials including the demo video and the code are available in SigPort.

<div> Mamba, Underwater Instance Segmentation, Dynamic Tree Scan, Hidden State Weaken, UIS-Mamba <br />
Summary:
Mamba is a state space model that can be adapted for underwater instance segmentation. A new model, UIS-Mamba, is proposed with innovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), designed to address challenges in underwater scene segmentation. The DTS module maintains internal feature continuity by dynamically offsetting and scaling patches, while the HSW module suppresses complex background interference. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on UIIS and USIS10K datasets with low parameters and computational complexity. The code for UIS-Mamba is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Maricalce/UIS-Mamba. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2508.00421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater Instance Segmentation (UIS) tasks are crucial for underwater complex scene detection. Mamba, as an emerging state space model with inherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable for processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However, due to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in applying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot maintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of severely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the hidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the understanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first Mamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two innovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to migrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of the internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to dynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and providing dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the interference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information flow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based hidden state weakening mechanism. Experimental results show that UIS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both UIIS and USIS10K datasets, while maintaining a low number of parameters and computational complexity.

<div> Keywords: amodal completion, human-object interactions, physical prior knowledge, multi-regional inpainting, diffusion model

Summary: <br /><br />Researchers have introduced a novel approach to improve amodal completion in dynamic human-object interaction scenarios. By leveraging physical prior knowledge and a specialized multi-regional inpainting technique, the model identifies primary and secondary regions for occlusion handling. Customized denoising strategies are applied within a diffusion model to enhance completion accuracy and realism in shape and detail. The proposed method surpasses existing techniques in generating plausible completions, advancing machine perception towards human-like understanding of dynamic environments. Moreover, the approach demonstrates robustness even without ground-truth contact annotations, extending its utility to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis. <div>
arXiv:2508.00427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amodal completion, which is the process of inferring the full appearance of objects despite partial occlusions, is crucial for understanding complex human-object interactions (HOI) in computer vision and robotics. Existing methods, such as those that use pre-trained diffusion models, often struggle to generate plausible completions in dynamic scenarios because they have a limited understanding of HOI. To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach that uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional inpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints from human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions: the primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the secondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional inpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions within a diffusion model. This improves the accuracy and realism of the generated completions in both their shape and visual detail. Our experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in HOI scenarios, moving machine perception closer to a more human-like understanding of dynamic environments. We also show that our pipeline is robust even without ground-truth contact annotations, which broadens its applicability to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis.

Summary:
A new approach is proposed for addressing challenges in training machine learning models for aerial inspection of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants using drones. A synthetic dataset called AerialCSP is introduced to simulate real-world conditions and facilitate model pretraining. The dataset provides annotated data for object detection and image segmentation tasks, and multiple models are benchmarked on AerialCSP to establish a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks. Pretraining on AerialCSP is shown to improve real-world fault detection, especially for rare and small defects, reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. The AerialCSP dataset is made publicly available, offering a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, aerial images captured by drones present a unique set of challenges. Unlike urban or natural landscapes commonly found in existing datasets, solar fields contain highly reflective surfaces, and domain-specific elements that are uncommon in traditional computer vision benchmarks. As a result, machine learning models trained on generic datasets struggle to generalize to this setting without extensive retraining and large volumes of annotated data. However, collecting and labeling such data is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for rapid deployment in industrial applications.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: the creation of AerialCSP, a virtual dataset that simulates aerial imagery of CSP plants. By generating synthetic data that closely mimic real-world conditions, our objective is to facilitate pretraining of models before deployment, significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce AerialCSP, a high-quality synthetic dataset for aerial inspection of CSP plants, providing annotated data for object detection and image segmentation; (2) we benchmark multiple models on AerialCSP, establishing a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks; and (3) we demonstrate that pretraining on AerialCSP significantly improves real-world fault detection, particularly for rare and small defects, reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. AerialCSP is made publicly available at https://mpcutino.github.io/aerialcsp/.

Abstract: Tubular structure segmentation (TSS) is important for various applications, such as hemodynamic analysis and route navigation. Despite significant progress in TSS, domain shifts remain a major challenge, leading to performance degradation in unseen target domains. Unlike other segmentation tasks, TSS is more sensitive to domain shifts, as changes in topological structures can compromise segmentation integrity, and variations in local features distinguishing foreground from background (e.g., texture and contrast) may further disrupt topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose Topology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time adaptation framework designed specifically for TSS. TopoTTA consists of two stages: Stage 1 adapts models to cross-domain topological discrepancies using the proposed Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs), which enhance topological representation without altering pre-trained parameters; Stage 2 improves topological continuity by a novel Topology Hard sample Generation (TopoHG) strategy and prediction alignment on hard samples with pseudo-labels in the generated pseudo-break regions. Extensive experiments across four scenarios and ten datasets demonstrate TopoTTA's effectiveness in handling topological distribution shifts, achieving an average improvement of 31.81% in clDice. TopoTTA also serves as a plug-and-play TTA solution for CNN-based TSS models.

Summary: 
Recent advances in interactive matting have been successful in capturing main object regions but struggle with fine details in edge regions. This study introduces SDMatte, a diffusion-driven interactive matting model. It leverages diffusion models' data distribution modeling and text-driven interaction capabilities to enable interactive matting. By incorporating visual prompts and opacity embeddings into a U-Net architecture, SDMatte improves sensitivity to spatial and opacity information. Additionally, a masked self-attention mechanism focuses the model on specified areas, enhancing performance. Extensive experiments across various datasets confirm the effectiveness of SDMatte in interactive matting tasks. The code and model for SDMatte are publicly available on GitHub, providing a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2508.00443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent interactive matting methods have shown satisfactory performance in capturing the primary regions of objects, but they fall short in extracting fine-grained details in edge regions. Diffusion models trained on billions of image-text pairs, demonstrate exceptional capability in modeling highly complex data distributions and synthesizing realistic texture details, while exhibiting robust text-driven interaction capabilities, making them an attractive solution for interactive matting. To this end, we propose SDMatte, a diffusion-driven interactive matting model, with three key contributions. First, we exploit the powerful priors of diffusion models and transform the text-driven interaction capability into visual prompt-driven interaction capability to enable interactive matting. Second, we integrate coordinate embeddings of visual prompts and opacity embeddings of target objects into U-Net, enhancing SDMatte's sensitivity to spatial position information and opacity information. Third, we propose a masked self-attention mechanism that enables the model to focus on areas specified by visual prompts, leading to better performance. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, validating its effectiveness in interactive matting. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/vivoCameraResearch/SDMatte.

Summary:
AutoDebias is a novel framework designed to automatically detect and mitigate social biases present in Text-to-Image (T2I) models. It addresses both subtle and overlapping biases, which existing methods struggle with. The framework leverages vision-language models to identify biased visual patterns and create fairness guides by generating inclusive alternative prompts. These guides drive a training process guided by CLIP, resulting in fairer outputs while maintaining image quality and diversity. In evaluations covering over 25 bias scenarios, AutoDebias achieved a 91.6% accuracy in detecting harmful patterns and reduced biased outputs significantly. The framework successfully tackled challenging cases involving multiple interacting biases, effectively lowering biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels. <div>

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models generate high-quality images from text prompts but often exhibit unintended social biases, such as gender or racial stereotypes, even when these attributes are not mentioned. Existing debiasing methods work well for simple or well-known cases but struggle with subtle or overlapping biases. We propose AutoDebias, a framework that automatically identifies and mitigates harmful biases in T2I models without prior knowledge of specific bias types. Specifically, AutoDebias leverages vision-language models to detect biased visual patterns and constructs fairness guides by generating inclusive alternative prompts that reflect balanced representations. These guides drive a CLIP-guided training process that promotes fairer outputs while preserving the original model's image quality and diversity. Unlike existing methods, AutoDebias effectively addresses both subtle stereotypes and multiple interacting biases. We evaluate the framework on a benchmark covering over 25 bias scenarios, including challenging cases where multiple biases occur simultaneously. AutoDebias detects harmful patterns with 91.6% accuracy and reduces biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels, while preserving the visual fidelity of the original model.

Abstract: Understanding the temporal dynamics of biological growth is critical across diverse fields such as microbiology, agriculture, and biodegradation research. Although vision-language models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) have shown strong capabilities in joint visual-textual reasoning, their effectiveness in capturing temporal progression remains limited. To address this, we propose CLIPTime, a multimodal, multitask framework designed to predict both the developmental stage and the corresponding timestamp of fungal growth from image and text inputs. Built upon the CLIP architecture, our model learns joint visual-textual embeddings and enables time-aware inference without requiring explicit temporal input during testing. To facilitate training and evaluation, we introduce a synthetic fungal growth dataset annotated with aligned timestamps and categorical stage labels. CLIPTime jointly performs classification and regression, predicting discrete growth stages alongside continuous timestamps. We also propose custom evaluation metrics, including temporal accuracy and regression error, to assess the precision of time-aware predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIPTime effectively models biological progression and produces interpretable, temporally grounded outputs, highlighting the potential of vision-language models in real-world biological monitoring applications.

arXiv:2508.00453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion (MHIF) is to generate high-quality images that simultaneously possess rich spectral information and fine spatial details. However, due to the inherent trade-off between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba architecture that maintains information consistency during feature transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIF-Net achieves significantly better image restoration performance than current state-of-the-art methods while maintaining model efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video super-resolution (VSR) models have demonstrated impressive results in enhancing low-resolution videos. However, due to limitations in adequately controlling the generation process, achieving high fidelity alignment with the low-resolution input while maintaining temporal consistency across frames remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose Semantic and Temporal Guided Video Super-Resolution (SeTe-VSR), a novel approach that incorporates both semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in the latent diffusion space to address these challenges. By incorporating high-level semantic information and integrating spatial and temporal information, our approach achieves a seamless balance between recovering intricate details and ensuring temporal coherence. Our method not only preserves high-reality visual content but also significantly enhances fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SeTe-VSR outperforms existing methods in terms of detail recovery and perceptual quality, highlighting its effectiveness for complex video super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems. Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a 5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

<title>LAMIC: Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition via Scalability of Multimodal Diffusion Transformer</title>

Abstract: In controllable image synthesis, generating coherent and consistent images from multiple references with spatial layout awareness remains an open challenge. We present LAMIC, a Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition framework that, for the first time, extends single-reference diffusion models to multi-reference scenarios in a training-free manner. Built upon the MMDiT model, LAMIC introduces two plug-and-play attention mechanisms: 1) Group Isolation Attention (GIA) to enhance entity disentanglement; and 2) Region-Modulated Attention (RMA) to enable layout-aware generation. To comprehensively evaluate model capabilities, we further introduce three metrics: 1) Inclusion Ratio (IN-R) and Fill Ratio (FI-R) for assessing layout control; and 2) Background Similarity (BG-S) for measuring background consistency. Extensive experiments show that LAMIC achieves state-of-the-art performance across most major metrics: it consistently outperforms existing multi-reference baselines in ID-S, BG-S, IN-R and AVG scores across all settings, and achieves the best DPG in complex composition tasks. These results demonstrate LAMIC's superior abilities in identity keeping, background preservation, layout control, and prompt-following, all achieved without any training or fine-tuning, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization ability. By inheriting the strengths of advanced single-reference models and enabling seamless extension to multi-image scenarios, LAMIC establishes a new training-free paradigm for controllable multi-image composition. As foundation models continue to evolve, LAMIC's performance is expected to scale accordingly. Our implementation is available at: https://github.com/Suchenl/LAMIC.

Abstract: We present SAMSA 2.0, an interactive segmentation framework for hyperspectral medical imaging that introduces spectral angle prompting to guide the Segment Anything Model (SAM) using spectral similarity alongside spatial cues. This early fusion of spectral information enables more accurate and robust segmentation across diverse spectral datasets. Without retraining, SAMSA 2.0 achieves up to +3.8% higher Dice scores compared to RGB-only models and up to +3.1% over prior spectral fusion methods. Our approach enhances few-shot and zero-shot performance, demonstrating strong generalization in challenging low-data and noisy scenarios common in clinical imaging.

<title>LesiOnTime -- Joint Temporal and Clinical Modeling for Small Breast Lesion Segmentation in Longitudinal DCE-MRI</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00496</link>

arXiv:2508.00496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of small lesions in Breast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) is critical for early cancer detection, especially in high-risk patients. While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation, they primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and clinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening, detecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across timepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS score. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics clinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and BIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA) block that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans; and (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent space alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding domain knowledge into the training process. Evaluated on a curated in-house longitudinal dataset of high-risk patients with DCE-MRI, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art single-timepoint and longitudinal baselines by 5% in terms of Dice. Ablation studies demonstrate that both TPA and BCR contribute complementary performance gains. These results highlight the importance of incorporating temporal and clinical context for reliable early lesion segmentation in real-world breast cancer screening.

<title>Leveraging Convolutional and Graph Networks for an Unsupervised Remote Sensing Labelling Tool</title>

Abstract: Machine learning for remote sensing imaging relies on up-to-date and accurate labels for model training and testing. Labelling remote sensing imagery is time and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work, we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be formed within the encoding space.

<title>Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Grounding on Egocentric Videos</title>

Abstract: Spatiotemporal video grounding aims to localize target entities in videos based on textual queries. While existing research has made significant progress in exocentric videos, the egocentric setting remains relatively underexplored, despite its growing importance in applications such as augmented reality and robotics. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the discrepancies between egocentric and exocentric videos, revealing key challenges such as shorter object durations, sparser trajectories, smaller object sizes, and larger positional shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce EgoMask, the first pixel-level benchmark for fine-grained spatiotemporal grounding in egocentric videos. It is constructed by our proposed automatic annotation pipeline, which annotates referring expressions and object masks across short-, medium-, and long-term videos. Additionally, we create EgoMask-Train, a large-scale training dataset to facilitate model development. Experiments demonstrate that the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal grounding models perform poorly on our benchmark EgoMask, but fine-tuning on EgoMask-Train yields significant improvements, while preserving performance on exocentric datasets. Our work thus provides essential resources and insights for advancing egocentric video understanding. Our code is available at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/EgoMask .

<title>EPANet: Efficient Path Aggregation Network for Underwater Fish Detection</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00528</link>
<guid>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00528</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underwater fish detection (UFD) remains a challenging task in computer vision due to low object resolution, significant background interference, and high visual similarity between targets and surroundings. Existing approaches primarily focus on local feature enhancement or incorporate complex attention mechanisms to highlight small objects, often at the cost of increased model complexity and reduced efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient path aggregation network (EPANet), which leverages complementary feature integration to achieve accurate and lightweight UFD. EPANet consists of two key components: an efficient path aggregation feature pyramid network (EPA-FPN) and a multi-scale diverse-division short path bottleneck (MS-DDSP bottleneck). The EPA-FPN introduces long-range skip connections across disparate scales to improve semantic-spatial complementarity, while cross-layer fusion paths are adopted to enhance feature integration efficiency. The MS-DDSP bottleneck extends the conventional bottleneck structure by introducing finer-grained feature division and diverse convolutional operations, thereby increasing local feature diversity and representation capacity. Extensive experiments on benchmark UFD datasets demonstrate that EPANet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and inference speed, while maintaining comparable or even lower parameter complexity.

<title>Video Color Grading via Look-Up Table Generation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00548</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2508.00548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different from color correction and transfer, color grading involves adjusting colors for artistic or storytelling purposes in a video, which is used to establish a specific look or mood. However, due to the complexity of the process and the need for specialized editing skills, video color grading remains primarily the domain of professional colorists. In this paper, we present a reference-based video color grading framework. Our key idea is explicitly generating a look-up table (LUT) for color attribute alignment between reference scenes and input video via a diffusion model. As a training objective, we enforce that high-level features of the reference scenes like look, mood, and emotion should be similar to that of the input video. Our LUT-based approach allows for color grading without any loss of structural details in the whole video frames as well as achieving fast inference. We further build a pipeline to incorporate a user-preference via text prompts for low-level feature enhancement such as contrast and brightness, etc. Experimental results, including extensive user studies, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for video color grading. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/seunghyuns98/VideoColorGrading.

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each architectural module and explore its interactions.

<div> dynamic camera motion, video quality, background scene consistency, foreground object consistency, text-to-video models

Summary:
DynamicEval introduces a new benchmark for evaluating text-to-video (T2V) models, addressing limitations in existing benchmarks. The benchmark focuses on dynamic camera motion and evaluates video quality based on background scene consistency and foreground object consistency. They propose new metrics for background consistency and foreground consistency, improving alignment with human judgments. The benchmark consists of systematically curated prompts with human annotations on video pairs generated by ten T2V models. The study identifies limitations in existing metrics, particularly in cases of occlusions/disocclusions, and presents solutions for more accurate evaluation of video quality. Extensive experiments show that the proposed metrics achieve stronger correlations with human preferences, establishing DynamicEval as a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic camera motion. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation, however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with 45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases: occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements. Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic camera motion.

<div> Keywords: Fast convergence, high-quality image recovery, regularization by denoising, image priors, Restarted Inertia with Score-based Priors

Summary: <br><br>Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are crucial for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods like regularization by denoising (RED) typically focus on enhancing image priors for better reconstruction quality, leaving convergence acceleration as a heuristic. To address this gap, Restarted Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) is introduced as an extension of RED. RISP integrates restarting inertia for rapid convergence while incorporating score-based image priors for superior reconstruction. The method demonstrates a faster stationary-point convergence rate compared to RED without the need for image prior convexity. Additionally, the associated continuous-time dynamical system reveals the connection between RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experimental results confirm that RISP facilitates quick convergence and high-quality reconstructions across various imaging inverse problems. <div>

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods, such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

<div> Keywords: uLDCT, CT denoising, Image Purification, Frequency-domain Flow Matching, anatomical structure preservation

Summary: 
This paper introduces a denoising framework for ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) images, which have high noise and artifacts. The proposed Image Purification (IP) strategy creates aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs for network training. The Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model is then used to enhance anatomical structure preservation in denoised images. The real clinical dataset used in the study shows that the IP strategy improves the performance of existing denoising models on uLDCT images. The combination of FFM with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art results in preserving anatomical structures in uLDCT images. This work provides an effective solution to the data mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. The code and dataset used in the study are available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/flow-matching.

The article discusses the need for robust watermarking methods to ensure content attribution and provenance in the age of generative models. Despite recent improvements in semantic watermarking schemes, vulnerabilities exist, especially in resource-constrained adversarial settings. The authors introduce D2RA, a novel approach that can remove or weaken watermarks from images without requiring access to the underlying model. D2RA achieves this by leveraging natural priors across various representations to suppress watermark signals while maintaining visual quality. Experimental results across different watermarking schemes demonstrate the effectiveness of D2RA in reducing watermark detectability, highlighting inherent weaknesses in current designs.

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free, single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability, revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at https://github.com/Pragati-Meshram/DAWN.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel approach, PickStyle, for video style transfer using diffusion models. A key challenge in this task is the lack of paired video data for supervision. PickStyle enhances pretrained video diffusion backbones with style adapters and leverages paired still image data with source-style correspondences for training. This framework inserts low-rank adapters into self-attention layers to specialize in motion-style transfer while maintaining alignment between video content and style. To address the gap between static image supervision and dynamic video, synthetic training clips are generated with shared augmentations simulating camera motion. The approach also introduces Context-Style Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG) to factorize guidance into text (style) and video (context) directions, ensuring preservation of context in generated videos while effectively transferring style. Experimental results demonstrate that PickStyle produces temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video translations, outperforming existing baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion, ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Summary: 
This paper explores the challenge of assessing physical realism in video generated by models. While humans can easily detect violations of physical laws in videos, existing Video-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to do so. The authors introduce TRAVL, a training technique that improves motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs using a balanced dataset and trajectory-aware attention module. They also propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of 300 videos that allows for rigorous evaluation of physical reasoning in models. By combining TRAVL and ImplausiBench, the authors provide a unified framework for probing and improving physical plausibility in multimodal models, addressing a critical yet underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.  <div>

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of 300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together, TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood, HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically augmented HSI classification models.

Summary:
Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL) is proposed for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to prevent leakage of private data during tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA). The method leverages visual tokens and external modules to encode unlearning information for sensitive queries. CAGUL is lightweight, efficient, and retains reference model behavior without the need for costly finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that CAGUL outperforms finetuning-based approaches, ensuring data privacy without modifying pre-trained model parameters. This approach offers a practical and effective solution for tackling privacy concerns in VLMs, safeguarding against information leakage while maintaining model accuracy. Additionally, CAGUL considers the complex interplay between visual and textual contexts in VLMs, making it a versatile and reliable unlearning framework for multi-modal tasks. <br><br>Summary: Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL) is an efficient and effective framework designed to prevent private data leakage in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) during tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA), offering a practical solution without the need for costly model finetuning. <div>
arXiv:2510.07567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference. Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research, informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10 growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production environments.

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs. neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits. Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however, is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further improve QCN.

<div> Classifier-free guidance, rectified flow, visual artifacts, text misalignment, large-scale text-to-image models<br>
Summary:<br>
Rectified-CFG++ is introduced as an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance method for rectified flow models. It combines the efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning rule to address issues such as off-manifold drift and visual artifacts. Each inference step involves a conditional update to anchor the sample near the learned transport path, followed by a weighted conditional correction that balances conditional and unconditional velocity fields. The resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and ensures stability within a bounded neighborhood of the data manifold. Extensive experiments on text-to-image models demonstrate that Rectified-CFG++ outperforms standard CFG on benchmark datasets, including MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and T2I-CompBench. The approach shows improved performance in handling text-conditioned targets, yielding better alignment and reducing drift in image synthesis tasks.<br> <div>
arXiv:2510.07631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and T2I-CompBench.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM, a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and interactivity.

Summary:
The article introduces the Dual-Stream Alignment Network (DSA Net) for action segmentation, incorporating a second stream of learned action features to enhance performance. It utilizes a Temporal Context block for cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation to fuse features. The proposed Dual-Stream Alignment Loss includes relational consistency, cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses to encourage shared feature space learning. Evaluation on benchmark datasets shows DSA Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods.

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams. Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the spatio- temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary information using cross- attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation (Q- ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency, cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA, Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging. Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement: specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading performance under these constraints.

<br>
In this study, the authors propose a method to improve the personalization of diffusion models for image generation. By utilizing the IP-Adapter to automatically generate masks that separate the subject from the background, the text prompt can focus on the subject rather than recreating the entire image. This approach allows for more accurate and detailed image generation based on the given prompt. The method involves using the generated mask to restrict image tokens to the subject, ensuring that the final image reflects both the subject and the prompt. Comparisons with other personalization methods show that this approach results in high alignment between the prompt and the source image. The proposed method is particularly effective for text prompts describing locations and places, producing images that closely match both the subject and the prompt.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background, allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high prompt and source image alignment.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach for medical image registration using a Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP) model. The model incorporates a Feature-Enhanced Residual Module (FERM) in each decoding layer to improve anatomical structure alignment. Additionally, a dual-stage Threshold-Controlled Iterative (TCI) strategy dynamically determines the number of iterations for optimization based on image requirements. Experimental results on brain MRI and abdomen CT datasets show that TCIP outperforms existing registration networks in accuracy while maintaining speed and compactness. The generalizability of FERM and TCI is demonstrated through integration with other registration networks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Overall, TCIP improves registration accuracy by mitigating anatomical misalignments and adapting the optimization process based on image characteristics. <div>

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency compared to prior works.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation, overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2. Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model named BYOL-IMNet, which comprises four custom-designed blocks tailored for fault classification in thermal images. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BYOL-IMNet achieves 99.89\% test accuracy and an inference time of 5.7 ms per image, outperforming state-of-the-art models. This study highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust methodology for online monitoring in industrial settings.

Summary: <br>
Deep hashing is a popular technique for large-scale image retrieval, with different optimization strategies available. Pairwise-based methods focus on local similarity relationships, while center-based methods excel in capturing global data distributions. However, center-based methods may underutilize local similarity information. To address this, Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH) introduces a weak-to-strong framework where a center-based branch learns from a weaker pairwise-based branch. Through iterative mutual learning and a mixture-of-hash-experts module, MLH enhances both branches by transferring knowledge and enabling cross-branch interaction. Experiments show that MLH outperforms existing hashing methods on various benchmark datasets. <div>

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However, the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch. Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore, inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction, further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods across multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality, large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and weights upon acceptance.

arXiv:2510.07723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses. Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity, demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

The article introduces a new method called ComGS for 3D object-scene composition in immersive rendering. It addresses challenges in combining objects and scenes by utilizing Gaussian Splatting and Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs) for efficient relightable object reconstruction. SOPs enable real-time shadow computation and at least a 2x speedup in reconstruction compared to existing methods. The framework simplifies scene lighting estimation by focusing on environment lighting at the object's placement, achieving high-quality results with vivid shadows. By capturing a 360-degree reconstructed radiance field and fine-tuning a diffusion model, ComGS achieves real-time rendering at around 28 FPS and requires only 36 seconds for editing. The proposed method provides visually harmonious results and offers code and dataset availability for further research and development. <br> <div>

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360 degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for editing.

Summary:
Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes with exposure disparities pose challenges in preserving both highlight and shadow details. RGB-based bracketing methods may introduce misalignment and ghosting artifacts. This study proposes UltraLED, a two-stage framework using a single short-exposure RAW image for UHDR reconstruction.

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges, making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a 9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and dataset are made publicly available at https://srameo.github.io/projects/ultraled.

Summary:<br><br>
Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB videos faces challenges due to large inter-frame motions increasing solution space uncertainty. Event cameras capture rapid visual changes but lack color information, providing deterministic constraints for large motion. A novel framework optimizes Dynamic 3DGS from both RGB and event modalities by incorporating event motion priors. Motion priors are extracted from event streams using unsupervised fine-tuning to adapt an event flow estimator. A geometry-aware data association method creates event-Gaussian motion correspondence, supported by motion decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate outperformance of existing approaches, proving the efficacy of joint optimization using event data. <div>

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively, the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS with the help of event data.

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models. Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet (AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians' trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants (ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times, (ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii) classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments.

Summary: <br>
The article introduces a new benchmark called Geo-Temporal Reasoning (GTR-Bench) to assess the geographic spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs). Current benchmarks focus on egocentric or geographic perspective reasoning but fail to evaluate VLMs' abilities with both image/video and graphics context. GTR-Bench presents challenges such as multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across non-overlapping fields of view, and inference over unobserved spatial-temporal regions. Evaluation of VLMs on GTR-Bench reveals deficiencies in spatial-temporal context utilization, temporal forecasting, and aligning map data with multi-view video inputs. The best model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, lags significantly behind human performance on geo-temporal reasoning. The benchmark aims to provide insights and opportunities for research in spatial-temporal intelligence. <div>

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

Summary: <br>
Facial micro-expressions are subtle indicators of genuine emotions, challenging to capture but valuable in various fields. Current methods often miss essential motion information between micro-expression phases. This article introduces a new motion representation called Magnitude-Modulated Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF) that integrates motion dynamics from both micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor for recognition networks. The FMANet neural network architecture is proposed to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for classification, outperforming existing methods on standard benchmark datasets. The study demonstrates the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing micro-expression recognition. <div>

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements. Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods, underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing micro-expression recognition.

Summary:
The paper presents a novel framework for predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor panoramas. Existing methods focus on pixel-level accuracy, resulting in oversmoothed room corners and noise sensitivity. The proposed framework integrates room geometry information through layout prediction and background segmentation to improve depth estimation. The model comprises a shared feature encoder and task-specific decoders for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. Two strategies are incorporated: a room geometry-based background depth resolving strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods compared to current open-source methods. The code for the framework is available at https://github.com/emiyaning/RGCNet.

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D, Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/emiyaning/RGCNet.

<br>
Summary:<br>
Visual prompting (VP) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for adapting pre-trained vision models without changing parameters. However, conventional VP methods have limitations in expressivity and overfitting. To address these issues, ACAVP introduces affine and color transformations to enhance VP's power while mitigating overfitting with TrivialAugment data augmentation. ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among VP methods, surpasses linear probing, and shows robustness to distribution shifts, with minimal computational overhead during inference. This highlights the importance of data augmentation for VP training and the effectiveness of complementary transformations in improving performance. <div>

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP (Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational overhead during inference.

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale, Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12 everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14 interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object 3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.

<div> Keywords: 3D Gaussian Splatting, urban environments, regularization framework, multi-scale supervision, physically-grounded

Summary:
PrismGS addresses the limitations of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in rendering large urban environments by introducing a regularization framework. It integrates pyramidal multi-scale supervision to ensure anti-aliased representation across different viewing scales, reducing flickering textures. Additionally, an explicit size regularization imposes constraints on Gaussian dimensions, preventing the formation of degenerate primitives and minimizing jagged edges. The method is compatible with existing pipelines and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D datasets. PrismGS achieves significant PSNR gains of around 1.5 dB compared to CityGaussian, while maintaining superior quality and robustness in high-resolution (4K) rendering scenarios. <div>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing ``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around 1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1 accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics (PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating intelligible speech output.

<div> Keywords: 3D models, indoor scenes, semantic understanding, sparse-view reconstruction, semantic priors 

Summary: 
AlignGS is a new framework designed to address the challenge of creating semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes from sparse views. Unlike existing methods that treat semantics as a passive feature, AlignGS integrates semantic understanding as an active guiding force in the reconstruction process. By leveraging rich priors from 2D foundation models, the framework optimizes the geometry and semantics simultaneously using novel guidance mechanisms such as depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Through extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks, AlignGS demonstrates superior results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions with enhanced geometric accuracy. The approach showcases that utilizing semantic priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more complete and coherent 3D models generated from limited input views. The code for AlignGS is available on GitHub for further exploration.

arXiv:2510.07839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at https://github.com/MediaX-SJTU/AlignGS .

We provide a proof-of-concept that utilizes the publicly available EmbryoNet dataset, which contains ten zebrafish embryo phenotypes elicited by various chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration of machine learning models in a physical toxicity testing device in the context of the TOXBOX project.

Summary:  
XYZCylinder introduces a feedforward reconstruction paradigm for driving scenes, addressing challenges related to generalization and accuracy. It utilizes a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy to handle different camera configurations effectively. This approach eliminates the need to learn viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence, enhancing generalization across diverse scenes. Additionally, a hybrid representation based on the Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) is proposed to lift 2D image features to 3D space, improving reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate XYZCylinder's state-of-the-art performance under various evaluation settings and its ability to generalize to new driving scenes in a zero-shot manner.<br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner.

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a \textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by \textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance, and autonomous driving.

The framework introduces four key evaluation dimensions: generalization performance across datasets and pipelines, ratio of synthetic to real data, correlation between synthesis image metrics and anomaly detection performance, and strategies for hybrid synthesis methods.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection, quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv) strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments, ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly synthesis

Summary:<br>
The article introduces Test-Time Optimization and Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework for improving text-image alignment in Video Foundation Models (VFMs) in compositional scenarios. Instead of directly intervening in latents or attention per-sample, TTOM integrates and optimizes new parameters guided by a layout-attention objective during inference. The framework also formulates video generation within a streaming setting and utilizes a parametric memory mechanism to maintain historical optimization contexts, enabling operations like insert, read, update, and delete. TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge, showcasing strong transferability and generalization abilities. Experimental results on benchmark datasets T2V-CompBench and Vbench confirm TTOM's effectiveness, practicality, scalability, and efficiency for achieving cross-modal alignment in compositional video generation on the fly. <br><br>Summary: <div>

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy, and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work, we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge, showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective, practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment for compositional video generation on the fly.

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with 4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene understanding.

Summary:
The article introduces AnimeText, a large-scale dataset designed for text detection in anime scenes. Existing text detection datasets are not suitable for anime scenarios, as text in anime scenes is diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and may be confused with visual elements. AnimeText contains 735K images and 4.2M annotated text blocks, with hierarchical annotations and hard negative samples tailored for anime scenes. Cross-dataset evaluations show that models trained on AnimeText outperform those trained on existing datasets for anime text detection tasks. The dataset's robustness in complex anime scenes was evaluated through benchmarking, confirming its superior performance. The dataset is available on HuggingFace for researchers to access and utilize for further research in text detection in anime scenes.

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes, where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines. However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection methods. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection tasks.

Summary:
SimCast is a novel training pipeline for precipitation nowcasting that incorporates a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique and a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. The model generates deterministic predictions without increasing inference overhead. CasCast, a diffusion-based framework, integrates SimCast to combine the strengths of deterministic and probabilistic models, addressing limitations like blurriness and distribution shift. Experimental results on SEVIR, HKO-7, and MeteoNet datasets show significant improvement over existing approaches, with mean CSI scores of 0.452, 0.474, and 0.361, respectively. The framework demonstrates the effectiveness of considering prediction horizons and integrating deterministic and probabilistic models for accurate precipitation nowcasting.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture, transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and 0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin.

Summary: 
The article introduces Latent Harmony, a framework for Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration that balances computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. The framework consists of two stages: LH-VAE, which refines VAEs for UHD restoration by enhancing semantic robustness and high-frequency reconstruction, and High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA), which jointly trains the refined VAE with a restoration model to recover authentic details and synthesize realistic textures. The framework allows for flexible fidelity-perception trade-offs through a tunable parameter. Experiment results show that Latent Harmony achieves state-of-the-art performance in both UHD and standard-resolution tasks, effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction accuracy.<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks, effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction accuracy.

<div> Object tags, abstract tags, computer vision tasks, image privacy, tag budget<br>
Summary:<br>
This paper investigates the effectiveness of object tags versus abstract tags in the context of image privacy classification. Object tags represent concrete entities in images, while abstract tags capture higher-level, subjective information. The study shows that when the tag budget is limited, abstract tags are more efficient for privacy classification. However, with a larger number of tags per image, object-related information becomes equally valuable. These findings suggest that the type and quantity of tags play a crucial role in developing accurate image privacy classifiers. By understanding the role of different tag types, future research can optimize image privacy classification algorithms for improved performance. <br> <div>
arXiv:2510.07976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy. While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely, when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag types and quantity.

- The study focuses on enhancing low-light imagery by comparing the performance and efficiency of a Transformer-based SwinIR model with a standard lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
- SwinIR achieved higher peak performance with a PSNR of 39.03 dB, while surprisingly, the CNN also performed well with a competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB.
- The CNN reached its performance level in just 10 training epochs, in contrast to the 132 epochs required by SwinIR. 
- Despite the performance difference, the CNN is significantly smaller in size, being over 55 times smaller than SwinIR.
- The study highlights that a standard CNN can provide nearly state-of-the-art results with much lower computational requirements, making it a practical choice for real-world applications with resource constraints. <br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.07984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially, the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead, presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource constraints are a primary concern.

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network, GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at https://github.com/event-driven-robotics/GraphEnet-NeVi-ICCV2025.

<div> Keywords: Composed Image Retrieval, Vision-Language Models, Multimodal Large Language Models, Chain-of-Thought reasoning, structured CoT annotations

Summary: 
Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to find a target image by utilizing a reference image and modification text, necessitating unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While existing models like Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown progress, they lack transparency and struggle with complex instructions. To address this, CIR-CoT introduces end-to-end retrieval-oriented MLLM with explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, enhancing both retrieval accuracy and interpretability. By creating structured CoT annotations through a three-stage process and fine-tuning the model accordingly, CIR-CoT achieves competitive performance on in-domain datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR, while also demonstrating strong generalization on out-of-domain datasets like CIRCO. This work paves the way for more effective and trustworthy retrieval systems. 

<br><br>Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.08003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption, reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset, establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval systems.

Summary:<br>
RayFusion proposes a ray-based fusion method for collaborative visual perception in autonomous driving, addressing the lack of explicit depth information in camera-based systems. By utilizing ray occupancy information from collaborators, RayFusion enhances the accuracy of 3D object detection by reducing redundancy and false positives along camera rays. The method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in comprehensive experiments, advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception systems. The code for RayFusion is publicly available, allowing for implementation and further development in the autonomous driving community. <div>

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g., 3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is available at https://github.com/wangsh0111/RayFusion.

Summary: 
The paper introduces RASALoRE, a two-stage Weakly Supervised Anomaly Detection (WSAD) framework for brain MRI scans. The first stage utilizes Discriminative Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) to generate high-quality pseudo weak masks from slice-level labels. In the second stage, a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial attention mechanism focuses on anomalous regions using fixed location-based random embeddings. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance with less than 8 million parameters, surpassing existing WSAD methods. Evaluation on BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD datasets shows improved performance and reduced computational complexity. The code for RASALoRE is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels (e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a significant reduction in computational complexity.

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

<title>A class-driven hierarchical ResNet for classification of multispectral remote sensing images</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08060</link>

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS) of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a better representation of the minoritarian classes.

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media. While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9 commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found "in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover, RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators. Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain, intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against real-world applications. We further perform a detailed analysis of the RedFace dataset, elucidating the reason of its impact on detection performance compared to conventional datasets. Our dataset is available at: https://github.com/kikyou-220/RedFace.

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora), urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The source code is available at https://github.com/ZSHsh98/NSG-VD.

<title>DarkHash: A Data-Free Backdoor Attack Against Deep Hashing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08094</link>

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency, deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval. Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results, they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns. Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two 3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing. Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective solution for improving face parsing robustness in real- world settings.

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload. Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation. However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing. We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control, then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page: https://kesenzhao.github.io/AR-Drag.github.io/.

<title>Improving Temporal Understanding Logic Consistency in Video-Language Models via Attention Enhancement</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads, validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal understanding.

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with existing techniques.

<title>Beyond Textual CoT: Interleaved Text-Image Chains with Deep Confidence Reasoning for Image Editing</title>

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step. By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset, comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that our method yields significant improvements across three image editing benchmarks.

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost. Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately, real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing, with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately, refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over image content.

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage, predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

<title>Adaptive Gradient Calibration for Single-Positive Multi-Label Learning in Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification</title>

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels. While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC), a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across diverse settings.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them, always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band, while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row. Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile, serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion models.

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and reliable referent detection.

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present, e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point, enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation. While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel, we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by over 55% over best-performing baselines.

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with all the other queries to directly encode the global context information. Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of 11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain. Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise, prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D affordance segmentation.

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis. However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

<title>Evaluating Small Vision-Language Models on Distance-Dependent Traffic Perception</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful, demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs, our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85% human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain particularly challenging for these models.

Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient method to enhance and clarify images. More specifically, we deal with low light image enhancement and clarification of hazy imagery (hazy/foggy images, images containing sand dust, and underwater images). Our method involves constructing an image filter to simulate low-light or hazy conditions and deriving approximate reverse filters to minimize distortions in the enhanced images. Experimental results show that our approach is highly competitive and often surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in handling extremely dark images and in enhancing hazy images. A key advantage of our approach lies in its simplicity: Our method is implementable with just a few lines of MATLAB code.

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales. However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work, we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model, which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep generative models for data augmentation.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation, where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis. To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols. However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85% IoU, and reveal how prompt design, example counts, and layout alignment affect performance. This approach supports scalable, layout-aware legend parsing and improves the indexing and searchability of historical maps across various visual styles.

<title>Robust Source-Free Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation based on Curriculum Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies, which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First, current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models. Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes, sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions. Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V generators are from world models.

<title>Large Scale Diffusion Distillation via Score-Regularized Continuous-Time Consistency</title>

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models. Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering" nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate high-fidelity samples in only $1\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling by $15\times\sim50\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion distillation.

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing, integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity. Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation, and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes, respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection, Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment), Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and computer vision.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination. Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2, Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the \textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$ state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines; and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}. Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress, most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Traumatic brain injuries present significant diagnostic challenges in emergency medicine, where the timely interpretation of medical images is crucial for patient outcomes. In this paper, we propose a novel AI-based approach for automatic radiology report generation tailored to cranial trauma cases. Our model integrates an AC-BiFPN with a Transformer architecture to capture and process complex medical imaging data such as CT and MRI scans. The AC-BiFPN extracts multi-scale features, enabling the detection of intricate anomalies like intracranial hemorrhages, while the Transformer generates coherent, contextually relevant diagnostic reports by modeling long-range dependencies. We evaluate the performance of our model on the RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection dataset, where it outperforms traditional CNN-based models in both diagnostic accuracy and report generation. This solution not only supports radiologists in high-pressure environments but also provides a powerful educational tool for trainee physicians, offering real-time feedback and enhancing their learning experience. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining advanced feature extraction with transformer-based text generation to improve clinical decision-making in the diagnosis of traumatic brain injuries.

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise, compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first \underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo \underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment. Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored \underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in general-purpose video restoration systems.

<title>To Sink or Not to Sink: Visual Information Pathways in Large Vision-Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end -- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems, especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes, enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging, achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained with raw LiDAR scans.

<title>SliceFine: The Universal Winning-Slice Hypothesis for Pretrained Networks</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08513</link>

arXiv:2510.08513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small, randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich, task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis, which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing PEFT techniques.

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues, enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning, drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible action control and mesh animations.

arXiv:2510.08531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization, single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks, demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is essential for robust spatial intelligence.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models, followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes, without requiring attribute-specific training.

Abstract: While current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in reasoning tasks such as mathematics and logic, their capacity for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability. Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization (AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way for developing more capable MLLMs.

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm) pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4) unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff: per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive, whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both accurate geometry and high visual fidelity.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1) a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2) Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this imagination-guided paradigm.

<title>VideoCanvas: Unified Video Completion from Arbitrary Spatiotemporal Patches via In-Context Conditioning</title>

arXiv:2510.08555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision, however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models: the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC) paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control: spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms, establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills. To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system. Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs, driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex, or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process, resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally, we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic, customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to facilitate further research.

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that, we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs. Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs. Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future study of native MLLMs.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time, high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations. However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS, comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality and robustness under sparse view conditions.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of 11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA, MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating scalable and effective multimodal tool use. Our data and code is avaliable at https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/MATRIX.

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times 256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed.

Abstract: Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the Divide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each. This strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the influence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation typically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like data size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce Dynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that refines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions of subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set, considering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent aggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets yielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively combating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning multiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves generalization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of DUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization performance even when applied on top of other regularization methods, establishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating overfitting in modern deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/Saiful185/DUA-D2C.

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder significantly influences the communication abilities, learning processes, behavior, and social interactions of individuals. Although early intervention and customized educational strategies are critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and addressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic children prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the foundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite to improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor emotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding of the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in the Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited. Through a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a targeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to meet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a sequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep understanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis for effective skill development. By shifting the focus toward early identification of behavioral patterns, we aim to foster a more inclusive and supportive learning environment that can significantly improve the educational and developmental trajectory of children with ASD.

Abstract: Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances. The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness learning methods.

Abstract: GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development, leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces, motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder, which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch, reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup, our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.

Abstract: Effective analysis of time series data presents significant challenges due to the complex temporal dependencies and cross-channel interactions in multivariate data. Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g., classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting). These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series analysis.

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative, self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16 dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of compositional reasoning.

Abstract: This study evaluates whether integrating curriculum learning with diffusion-based synthetic augmentation can enhance the detection of difficult pulmonary nodules in chest radiographs, particularly those with low size, brightness, and contrast, which often challenge conventional AI models due to data imbalance and limited annotation. A Faster R-CNN with a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) backbone was trained on a hybrid dataset comprising expert-labeled NODE21 (1,213 patients; 52.4 percent male; mean age 63.2 +/- 11.5 years), VinDr-CXR, CheXpert, and 11,206 DDPM-generated synthetic images. Difficulty scores based on size, brightness, and contrast guided curriculum learning. Performance was compared to a non-curriculum baseline using mean average precision (mAP), Dice score, and area under the curve (AUC). Statistical tests included bootstrapped confidence intervals, DeLong tests, and paired t-tests. The curriculum model achieved a mean AUC of 0.95 versus 0.89 for the baseline (p < 0.001), with improvements in sensitivity (70 percent vs. 48 percent) and accuracy (82 percent vs. 70 percent). Stratified analysis demonstrated consistent gains across all difficulty bins (Easy to Very Hard). Grad-CAM visualizations confirmed more anatomically focused attention under curriculum learning. These results suggest that curriculum-guided synthetic augmentation enhances model robustness and generalization for pulmonary nodule detection.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to couple perception with robotic control, offering a promising path toward general-purpose embodied intelligence. However, current SOTA VLAs are primarily pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied scenarios, and then finetuned to map explicit instructions to actions. Consequently, due to the lack of reasoning-intensive pretraining and reasoning-guided manipulation, these models are unable to perform implicit human intention reasoning required for complex, real-world interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{IntentionVLA}, a VLA framework with a curriculum training paradigm and an efficient inference mechanism. Our proposed method first leverages carefully designed reasoning data that combine intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning, endowing the model with both reasoning and perception capabilities. In the following finetuning stage, IntentionVLA employs the compact reasoning outputs as contextual guidance for action generation, enabling fast inference under indirect instructions. Experimental results show that IntentionVLA substantially outperforms $\pi_0$, achieving 18\% higher success rates with direct instructions and 28\% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On out-of-distribution intention tasks, IntentionVLA achieves over twice the success rate of all baselines, and further enables zero-shot human-robot interaction with 40\% success rate. These results highlight IntentionVLA as a promising paradigm for next-generation human-robot interaction (HRI) systems.

Abstract: In this report, we describe the technical details of our submission to the IROS 2025 RoboSense Challenge Social Navigation Track. This track focuses on developing RGBD-based perception and navigation systems that enable autonomous agents to navigate safely, efficiently, and socially compliantly in dynamic human-populated indoor environments. The challenge requires agents to operate from an egocentric perspective using only onboard sensors including RGB-D observations and odometry, without access to global maps or privileged information, while maintaining social norm compliance such as safe distances and collision avoidance. Building upon the Falcon model, we introduce a Proactive Risk Perception Module to enhance social navigation performance. Our approach augments Falcon with collision risk understanding that learns to predict distance-based collision risk scores for surrounding humans, which enables the agent to develop more robust spatial awareness and proactive collision avoidance behaviors. The evaluation on the Social-HM3D benchmark demonstrates that our method improves the agent's ability to maintain personal space compliance while navigating toward goals in crowded indoor scenes with dynamic human agents, achieving 2nd place among 16 participating teams in the challenge.

Abstract: Gravitational lensing is one of the most powerful probes of dark matter, yet creating high-fidelity lensed images at scale remains a bottleneck. Existing tools rely on ray-tracing or forward-modeling pipelines that, while precise, are prohibitively slow. We introduce FlowLensing, a Diffusion Transformer-based compact and efficient flow-matching model for strong gravitational lensing simulation. FlowLensing operates in both discrete and continuous regimes, handling classes such as different dark matter models as well as continuous model parameters ensuring physical consistency. By enabling scalable simulations, our model can advance dark matter studies, specifically for probing dark matter substructure in cosmological surveys. We find that our model achieves a speedup of over 200$\times$ compared to classical simulators for intensive dark matter models, with high fidelity and low inference latency. FlowLensing enables rapid, scalable, and physically consistent image synthesis, offering a practical alternative to traditional forward-modeling pipelines.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital society, the proliferation of satellites in the Satellite Internet of Things (Sat-IoT) has led to the continuous accumulation of large-scale multi-temporal and multi-source images across diverse application scenarios. However, existing methods fail to fully exploit the complementary information embedded in both temporal and source dimensions. For example, Multi-Image Super-Resolution (MISR) enhances reconstruction quality by leveraging temporal complementarity across multiple observations, yet the limited fine-grained texture details in input images constrain its performance. Conversely, pansharpening integrates multi-source images by injecting high-frequency spatial information from panchromatic data, but typically relies on pre-interpolated low-resolution inputs and assumes noise-free alignment, making it highly sensitive to noise and misregistration. To address these issues, we propose SatFusion: A Unified Framework for Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion. Specifically, SatFusion first employs a Multi-Temporal Image Fusion (MTIF) module to achieve deep feature alignment with the panchromatic image. Then, a Multi-Source Image Fusion (MSIF) module injects fine-grained texture information from the panchromatic data. Finally, a Fusion Composition module adaptively integrates the complementary advantages of both modalities while dynamically refining spectral consistency, supervised by a weighted combination of multiple loss functions. Extensive experiments on the WorldStrat, WV3, QB, and GF2 datasets demonstrate that SatFusion significantly improves fusion quality, robustness under challenging conditions, and generalizability to real-world Sat-IoT scenarios.

Abstract: Drug recommendation is an essential task in machine learning-based clinical decision support systems. However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI) between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures. Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442 substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112), and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.

Abstract: Instruction-following navigation is a key step toward embodied intelligence. Prior benchmarks mainly focus on semantic understanding but overlook systematically evaluating navigation agents' spatial perception and reasoning capabilities. In this work, we introduce the NavSpace benchmark, which contains six task categories and 1,228 trajectory-instruction pairs designed to probe the spatial intelligence of navigation agents. On this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate 22 navigation agents, including state-of-the-art navigation models and multimodal large language models. The evaluation results lift the veil on spatial intelligence in embodied navigation. Furthermore, we propose SNav, a new spatially intelligent navigation model. SNav outperforms existing navigation agents on NavSpace and real robot tests, establishing a strong baseline for future work.

Abstract: Real-world datasets for deep learning frequently suffer from the co-occurring challenges of class imbalance and label noise, hindering model performance. While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial, as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually 'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models. Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in learning from long-tailed noisy data.

Abstract: We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on multiple object-centric datasets. Our method generalizes to diverse inputs, enabling the generation of relightable 3D assets useful in AR/VR, movies, games and other visual media.

Abstract: Neural fields excel at representing continuous visual signals but typically operate at a single, fixed resolution. We present a simple yet powerful method to optimize neural fields that can be prefiltered in a single forward pass. Key innovations and features include: (1) We perform convolutional filtering in the input domain by analytically scaling Fourier feature embeddings with the filter's frequency response. (2) This closed-form modulation generalizes beyond Gaussian filtering and supports other parametric filters (Box and Lanczos) that are unseen at training time. (3) We train the neural field using single-sample Monte Carlo estimates of the filtered signal. Our method is fast during both training and inference, and imposes no additional constraints on the network architecture. We show quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing methods for neural-field filtering.

<title>Biology-driven assessment of deep learning super-resolution imaging of the porosity network in dentin</title>

Abstract: The mechanosensory system of teeth is currently believed to partly rely on Odontoblast cells stimulation by fluid flow through a porosity network extending through dentin. Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models (RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.

Abstract: While reinforcement learning methods such as Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO) have significantly enhanced Large Language Models, adapting them to diffusion models remains challenging. In particular, GRPO demands a stochastic policy, yet the most cost-effective diffusion samplers are based on deterministic ODEs. Recent work addresses this issue by using inefficient SDE-based samplers to induce stochasticity, but this reliance on model-agnostic Gaussian noise leads to slow convergence. To resolve this conflict, we propose Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster training. Extensive results show that DGPO trains around 20 times faster than existing state-of-the-art methods and achieves superior performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain reward metrics. Code is available at https://github.com/Luo-Yihong/DGPO.

Abstract: We present DexMan, an automated framework that converts human visual demonstrations into bimanual dexterous manipulation skills for humanoid robots in simulation. Operating directly on third-person videos of humans manipulating rigid objects, DexMan eliminates the need for camera calibration, depth sensors, scanned 3D object assets, or ground-truth hand and object motion annotations. Unlike prior approaches that consider only simplified floating hands, it directly controls a humanoid robot and leverages novel contact-based rewards to improve policy learning from noisy hand-object poses estimated from in-the-wild videos.
  DexMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in object pose estimation on the TACO benchmark, with absolute gains of 0.08 and 0.12 in ADD-S and VSD. Meanwhile, its reinforcement learning policy surpasses previous methods by 19% in success rate on OakInk-v2. Furthermore, DexMan can generate skills from both real and synthetic videos, without the need for manual data collection and costly motion capture, and enabling the creation of large-scale, diverse datasets for training generalist dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: Radiance fields have emerged as a predominant representation for modeling 3D scene appearance. Neural formulations such as Neural Radiance Fields provide high expressivity but require costly ray marching for rendering, whereas primitive-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting offer real-time efficiency through splatting, yet at the expense of representational power. Inspired by advances in both these directions, we introduce splattable neural primitives, a new volumetric representation that reconciles the expressivity of neural models with the efficiency of primitive-based splatting. Each primitive encodes a bounded neural density field parameterized by a shallow neural network. Our formulation admits an exact analytical solution for line integrals, enabling efficient computation of perspectively accurate splatting kernels. As a result, our representation supports integration along view rays without the need for costly ray marching. The primitives flexibly adapt to scene geometry and, being larger than prior analytic primitives, reduce the number required per scene. On novel-view synthesis benchmarks, our approach matches the quality and speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting while using $10\times$ fewer primitives and $6\times$ fewer parameters. These advantages arise directly from the representation itself, without reliance on complex control or adaptation frameworks. The project page is https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/SplatNet/.

Abstract: Traditional multimodal learners find unified representations for tasks like visual question answering, but rely heavily on paired datasets. However, an overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image and audio.

Abstract: We present X2Video, the first diffusion model for rendering photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic channels including albedo, normal, roughness, metallicity, and irradiance, while supporting intuitive multi-modal controls with reference images and text prompts for both global and local regions. The intrinsic guidance allows accurate manipulation of color, material, geometry, and lighting, while reference images and text prompts provide intuitive adjustments in the absence of intrinsic information. To enable these functionalities, we extend the intrinsic-guided image generation model XRGB to video generation by employing a novel and efficient Hybrid Self-Attention, which ensures temporal consistency across video frames and also enhances fidelity to reference images. We further develop a Masked Cross-Attention to disentangle global and local text prompts, applying them effectively onto respective local and global regions. For generating long videos, our novel Recursive Sampling method incorporates progressive frame sampling, combining keyframe prediction and frame interpolation to maintain long-range temporal consistency while preventing error accumulation. To support the training of X2Video, we assembled a video dataset named InteriorVideo, featuring 1,154 rooms from 295 interior scenes, complete with reliable ground-truth intrinsic channel sequences and smooth camera trajectories. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that X2Video can produce long, temporally consistent, and photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic conditions. Additionally, X2Video effectively accommodates multi-modal controls with reference images, global and local text prompts, and simultaneously supports editing on color, material, geometry, and lighting through parametric tuning.

Abstract: Towards the aim of generalized robotic manipulation, spatial generalization is the most fundamental capability that requires the policy to work robustly under different spatial distribution of objects, environment and agent itself. To achieve this, substantial human demonstrations need to be collected to cover different spatial configurations for training a generalized visuomotor policy via imitation learning. Prior works explore a promising direction that leverages data generation to acquire abundant spatially diverse data from minimal source demonstrations. However, most approaches face significant sim-to-real gap and are often limited to constrained settings, such as fixed-base scenarios and predefined camera viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a real-to-real 3D data generation framework (R2RGen) that directly augments the pointcloud observation-action pairs to generate real-world data. R2RGen is simulator- and rendering-free, thus being efficient and plug-and-play. Specifically, given a single source demonstration, we introduce an annotation mechanism for fine-grained parsing of scene and trajectory. A group-wise augmentation strategy is proposed to handle complex multi-object compositions and diverse task constraints. We further present camera-aware processing to align the distribution of generated data with real-world 3D sensor. Empirically, R2RGen substantially enhances data efficiency on extensive experiments and demonstrates strong potential for scaling and application on mobile manipulation.

<title>DexNDM: Closing the Reality Gap for Dexterous In-Hand Rotation via Joint-Wise Neural Dynamics Model</title>

Abstract: Achieving generalized in-hand object rotation remains a significant challenge in robotics, largely due to the difficulty of transferring policies from simulation to the real world. The complex, contact-rich dynamics of dexterous manipulation create a "reality gap" that has limited prior work to constrained scenarios involving simple geometries, limited object sizes and aspect ratios, constrained wrist poses, or customized hands. We address this sim-to-real challenge with a novel framework that enables a single policy, trained in simulation, to generalize to a wide variety of objects and conditions in the real world. The core of our method is a joint-wise dynamics model that learns to bridge the reality gap by effectively fitting limited amount of real-world collected data and then adapting the sim policy's actions accordingly. The model is highly data-efficient and generalizable across different whole-hand interaction distributions by factorizing dynamics across joints, compressing system-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learning each joint's evolution from its own dynamic profile, implicitly capturing these net effects. We pair this with a fully autonomous data collection strategy that gathers diverse, real-world interaction data with minimal human intervention. Our complete pipeline demonstrates unprecedented generality: a single policy successfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes (e.g., animals), high aspect ratios (up to 5.33), and small sizes, all while handling diverse wrist orientations and rotation axes. Comprehensive real-world evaluations and a teleoperation application for complex tasks validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. Website: https://meowuu7.github.io/DexNDM/

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii) updating only the MLP Gate&amp;Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving held-out performance. Code is available at https://github.com/jessemelpolio/LMM_CL

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute novel manipulation tasks zero-shot is a central goal in robotics. Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms. We present NovaFlow, an autonomous manipulation framework that converts a task description into an actionable plan for a target robot without any demonstrations. Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a video generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using off-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative poses for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals and trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a tracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics model. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow naturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and deformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot quadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without demonstrations or embodiment-specific training.

Abstract: Real-World evaluation of perception-based planning models for robotic systems, such as autonomous vehicles, can be safely and inexpensively conducted offline, i.e., by computing model prediction error over a pre-collected validation dataset with ground-truth annotations. However, extrapolating from offline model performance to online settings remains a challenge. In these settings, seemingly minor errors can compound and result in test-time infractions or collisions. This relationship is understudied, particularly across diverse closed-loop metrics and complex urban maneuvers. In this work, we revisit this undervalued question in policy evaluation through an extensive set of experiments across diverse conditions and metrics. Based on analysis in simulation, we find an even worse correlation between offline and online settings than reported by prior studies, casting doubts on the validity of current evaluation practices and metrics for driving policies. Next, we bridge the gap between offline and online evaluation. We investigate an offline metric based on epistemic uncertainty, which aims to capture events that are likely to cause errors in closed-loop settings. The resulting metric achieves over 13% improvement in correlation compared to previous offline metrics. We further validate the generalization of our findings beyond the simulation environment in real-world settings, where even greater gains are observed.

Abstract: In current text-to-video retrieval (T2VR), videos to be retrieved have been properly trimmed so that a correspondence between the videos and ad-hoc textual queries naturally exists. Note in practice that videos circulated on the Internet and social media platforms, while being relatively short, are typically rich in their content. Often, multiple scenes / actions / events are shown in a single video, leading to a more challenging T2VR setting wherein only part of the video content is relevant w.r.t. a given query. This paper presents a first study on this setting which we term Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR). Considering that a video typically consists of multiple moments, a video is regarded as partially relevant w.r.t. to a given query if it contains a query-related moment. We formulate the PRVR task as a multiple instance learning problem, and propose a Multi-Scale Similarity Learning (MS-SL++) network that jointly learns both clip-scale and frame-scale similarities to determine the partial relevance between video-query pairs. Extensive experiments on three diverse video-text datasets (TVshow Retrieval, ActivityNet-Captions and Charades-STA) demonstrate the viability of the proposed method.

Abstract: Smart glasses are rapidly gaining advanced functions thanks to cutting-edge computing technologies, especially accelerated hardware architectures, and tiny Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms. However, integrating AI into smart glasses featuring a small form factor and limited battery capacity remains challenging for a satisfactory user experience. To this end, this paper proposes the design of a smart glasses platform for always-on on-device object detection with an all-day battery lifetime. The proposed platform is based on GAP9, a novel multi-core RISC-V processor from Greenwaves Technologies. Additionally, a family of sub-million parameter TinyissimoYOLO networks are proposed. They are benchmarked on established datasets, capable of differentiating up to 80 classes on MS-COCO. Evaluations on the smart glasses prototype demonstrate TinyissimoYOLO's inference latency of only 17ms and consuming 1.59mJ energy per inference. An end-to-end latency of 56ms is achieved which is equivalent to 18 frames per seconds (FPS) with a total power consumption of 62.9mW. This ensures continuous system runtime of up to 9.3 hours on a 154mAh battery. These results outperform MCUNet (TinyNAS+TinyEngine), which runs a simpler task (image classification) at just 7.3 FPS, while the 18 FPS achieved in this paper even include image-capturing, network inference, and detection post-processing. The algorithm's code is released open with this paper and can be found here: https://github.com/ETH-PBL/TinyissimoYOLO

Abstract: Albeit the scalable performance of vision transformers (ViTs), the dense computational costs (training & inference) undermine their position in industrial applications. Post-training quantization (PTQ), tuning ViTs with a tiny dataset and running in a low-bit format, well addresses the cost issue but unluckily bears more performance drops in lower-bit cases. In this paper, we introduce I&amp;S-ViT, a novel method that regulates the PTQ of ViTs in an inclusive and stable fashion. I&amp;S-ViT first identifies two issues in the PTQ of ViTs: (1) Quantization inefficiency in the prevalent log2 quantizer for post-Softmax activations; (2) Rugged and magnified loss landscape in coarse-grained quantization granularity for post-LayerNorm activations. Then, I&amp;S-ViT addresses these issues by introducing: (1) A novel shift-uniform-log2 quantizer (SULQ) that incorporates a shift mechanism followed by uniform quantization to achieve both an inclusive domain representation and accurate distribution approximation; (2) A three-stage smooth optimization strategy (SOS) that amalgamates the strengths of channel-wise and layer-wise quantization to enable stable learning. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse vision tasks validate I&amp;S-ViT' superiority over existing PTQ of ViTs methods, particularly in low-bit scenarios. For instance, I&amp;S-ViT elevates the performance of 3-bit ViT-B by an impressive 50.68%.

Abstract: Writer identification due to its widespread application in various fields has gained popularity over the years. In scenarios where optimum handwriting samples are available, whether they be in the form of a single line, a sentence, or an entire page, writer identification algorithms have demonstrated noteworthy levels of accuracy. However, in scenarios where only a limited number of handwritten samples are available, particularly in the form of word images, there is a significant scope for improvement.
  In this paper, we propose a writer identification system based on an attention-driven Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system is trained utilizing image segments, known as fragments, extracted from word images, employing a pyramid-based strategy. This methodology enables the system to capture a comprehensive representation of the data, encompassing both fine-grained details and coarse features across various levels of abstraction. These extracted fragments serve as the training data for the convolutional network, enabling it to learn a more robust representation compared to traditional convolution-based networks trained on word images. Additionally, the paper explores the integration of an attention mechanism to enhance the representational power of the learned features. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on three benchmark databases, demonstrating its proficiency in writer identification tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited access to handwriting data.

Abstract: Detecting falsified faces generated by Deepfake technology is essential for safeguarding trust in digital communication and protecting individuals. However, current detectors often suffer from a dual-overfitting: they become overly specialized in both specific forgery fingerprints and particular demographic attributes. Critically, most existing methods overlook the latter issue, which results in poor fairness: faces from certain demographic groups, such as different genders or ethnicities, are consequently more difficult to reliably detect. To address this challenge, we propose a novel strategy called misleading-learning, which populates the latent space with a multitude of redundant environments. By exposing the detector to a sufficiently rich and balanced variety of high-level information for demographic fairness, our approach mitigates demographic bias while maintaining a high detection performance level. We conduct extensive evaluations on fairness, intra-domain detection, cross-domain generalization, and robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves superior fairness and generalization compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: We present a simple yet effective method to improve the robustness of both Convolutional and attention-based Neural Networks against adversarial examples by post-processing an adversarially trained model. Our technique, MeanSparse, cascades the activation functions of a trained model with novel operators that sparsify mean-centered feature vectors. This is equivalent to reducing feature variations around the mean, and we show that such reduced variations merely affect the model's utility, yet they strongly attenuate the adversarial perturbations and decrease the attacker's success rate. Our experiments show that, when applied to the top models in the RobustBench leaderboard, MeanSparse achieves a new robustness record of 75.28% (from 73.71%), 44.78% (from 42.67%) and 62.12% (from 59.56%) on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, respectively, in terms of AutoAttack accuracy.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate reconstruction of a relightable, dynamic clothed human avatar from a monocular video is crucial for the entertainment industry. This paper presents SGIA (Surfel-based Gaussian Inverse Avatar), which introduces efficient training and rendering for relightable dynamic human reconstruction. SGIA advances previous Gaussian Avatar methods by comprehensively modeling Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) properties for clothed human avatars, allowing for the manipulation of avatars into novel poses under diverse lighting conditions. Specifically, our approach integrates pre-integration and image-based lighting for fast light calculations that surpass the performance of existing implicit-based techniques. To address challenges related to material lighting disentanglement and accurate geometry reconstruction, we propose an innovative occlusion approximation strategy and a progressive training approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGIA not only achieves highly accurate physical properties but also significantly enhances the realistic relighting of dynamic human avatars, providing a substantial speed advantage. We exhibit more results in our project page: https://GS-IA.github.io.

Abstract: Human motion capture is the foundation for many computer vision and graphics tasks. While industrial motion capture systems with complex camera arrays or expensive wearable sensors have been widely adopted in movie and game production, consumer-affordable and easy-to-use solutions for personal applications are still far from mature. To utilize a mixture of a monocular camera and very few inertial measurement units (IMUs) for accurate multi-modal human motion capture in daily life, we contribute MINIONS in this paper, a large-scale Motion capture dataset collected from INertial and visION Sensors. MINIONS has several featured properties: 1) large scale of over five million frames and 400 minutes duration; 2) multi-modality data of IMUs signals and RGB videos labeled with joint positions, joint rotations, SMPL parameters, etc.; 3) a diverse set of 146 fine-grained single and interactive actions with textual descriptions. With the proposed MINIONS dataset, we propose a SparseNet framework to capture human motion from IMUs and videos by discovering their supplementary features and exploring the possibilities of consumer-affordable motion capture using a monocular camera and very few IMUs. The experiment results emphasize the unique advantages of inertial and vision sensors, showcasing the promise of consumer-affordable multi-modal motion capture and providing a valuable resource for further research and development.

<title>Rethinking Decoders for Transformer-based Semantic Segmentation: A Compression Perspective</title>

Abstract: State-of-the-art methods for Transformer-based semantic segmentation typically adopt Transformer decoders that are used to extract additional embeddings from image embeddings via cross-attention, refine either or both types of embeddings via self-attention, and project image embeddings onto the additional embeddings via dot-product. Despite their remarkable success, these empirical designs still lack theoretical justifications or interpretations, thus hindering potentially principled improvements. In this paper, we argue that there are fundamental connections between semantic segmentation and compression, especially between the Transformer decoders and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). From such a perspective, we derive a white-box, fully attentional DEcoder for PrIncipled semantiC segemenTation (DEPICT), with the interpretations as follows: 1) the self-attention operator refines image embeddings to construct an ideal principal subspace that aligns with the supervision and retains most information; 2) the cross-attention operator seeks to find a low-rank approximation of the refined image embeddings, which is expected to be a set of orthonormal bases of the principal subspace and corresponds to the predefined classes; 3) the dot-product operation yields compact representation for image embeddings as segmentation masks. Experiments conducted on dataset ADE20K find that DEPICT consistently outperforms its black-box counterpart, Segmenter, and it is light weight and more robust.

Abstract: Curvature angle is a quantitative measurement of a curve, in which Cobb angle is customized for spinal curvature. Automatic Cobb angle measurement from X-ray images is crucial for scoliosis screening and diagnosis. However, most existing regression-based and segmentation-based methods struggle with inaccurate spine representations or mask connectivity and fragmentation issues. Besides, landmark-based methods suffer from insufficient training data and annotations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel curvature angle estimation framework named CurvNet including latent contour representation based contour detection and iterative data engine based image self-generation. Specifically, we propose a parameterized spine contour representation in latent space, which enables eigen-spine decomposition and spine contour reconstruction. Latent contour coefficient regression is combined with anchor box classification to solve inaccurate predictions and mask connectivity issues. Moreover, we develop a data engine with image self-generation, automatic annotation, and automatic selection in an iterative manner. By our data engine, we generate a clean dataset named Spinal-AI2024 without privacy leaks, which is the largest released scoliosis X-ray dataset to our knowledge. Extensive experiments on public AASCE2019, our private Spinal2023, and our generated Spinal-AI2024 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art Cobb angle estimation performance. Our code and Spinal-AI2024 dataset are available at https://github.com/Ernestchenchen/CurvNet and https://github.com/Ernestchenchen/Spinal-AI2024, respectively.

Abstract: Accurate meshing from monocular images remains a key challenge in 3D vision. While state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods excel at synthesizing photorealistic novel views through rasterization-based rendering, their reliance on sparse, explicit primitives severely limits their ability to recover watertight and topologically consistent 3D surfaces.We introduce MonoGSDF, a novel method that couples Gaussian-based primitives with a neural Signed Distance Field (SDF) for high-quality reconstruction. During training, the SDF guides Gaussians' spatial distribution, while at inference, Gaussians serve as priors to reconstruct surfaces, eliminating the need for memory-intensive Marching Cubes. To handle arbitrary-scale scenes, we propose a scaling strategy for robust generalization. A multi-resolution training scheme further refines details and monocular geometric cues from off-the-shelf estimators enhance reconstruction quality. Experiments on real-world datasets show MonoGSDF outperforms prior methods while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: Standard clothing asset generation involves restoring forward-facing flat-lay garment images displayed on a clear background by extracting clothing information from diverse real-world contexts, which presents significant challenges due to highly standardized structure sampling distributions and clothing semantic absence in complex scenarios. Existing models have limited spatial perception, often exhibiting structural hallucinations and texture distortion in this high-specification generative task. To address this issue, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, termed RAGDiffusion, to enhance structure determinacy and mitigate hallucinations by assimilating knowledge from language models and external databases. RAGDiffusion consists of two processes: (1) Retrieval-based structure aggregation, which employs contrastive learning and a Structure Locally Linear Embedding (SLLE) to derive global structure and spatial landmarks, providing both soft and hard guidance to counteract structural ambiguities; and (2) Omni-level faithful garment generation, which introduces a coarse-to-fine texture alignment that ensures fidelity in pattern and detail components within the diffusing. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that RAGDiffusion synthesizes structurally and texture-faithful clothing assets with significant performance improvements, representing a pioneering effort in high-specification faithful generation with RAG to confront intrinsic hallucinations and enhance fidelity.

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval is a critical task for managing diverse visual content, but common benchmarks for the task rely on small, single-domain datasets that fail to capture real-world complexity. Pre-trained vision-language models tend to perform well with easy negatives but struggle with hard negatives--visually similar yet incorrect images--especially in open-domain scenarios. To address this, we introduce Episodic Few-Shot Adaptation (EFSA), a novel test-time framework that adapts pre-trained models dynamically to a query's domain by fine-tuning on top-k retrieved candidates and synthetic captions generated for them. EFSA improves performance across diverse domains while preserving generalization, as shown in evaluations on queries from eight highly distinct visual domains and an open-domain retrieval pool of over one million images. Our work highlights the potential of episodic few-shot adaptation to enhance robustness in the critical and understudied task of open-domain text-to-image retrieval.

Abstract: Disaster events occur around the world and cause significant damage to human life and property. Earth observation (EO) data enables rapid and comprehensive building damage assessment (BDA), an essential capability in the aftermath of a disaster to reduce human casualties and to inform disaster relief efforts. Recent research focuses on the development of AI models to achieve accurate mapping of unseen disaster events, mostly using optical EO data. However, solutions based on optical data are limited to clear skies and daylight hours, preventing a prompt response to disasters. Integrating multimodal (MM) EO data, particularly the combination of optical and SAR imagery, makes it possible to provide all-weather, day-and-night disaster responses. Despite this potential, the development of robust multimodal AI models has been constrained by the lack of suitable benchmark datasets. In this paper, we present a BDA dataset using veRy-hIGH-resoluTion optical and SAR imagery (BRIGHT) to support AI-based all-weather disaster response. To the best of our knowledge, BRIGHT is the first open-access, globally distributed, event-diverse MM dataset specifically curated to support AI-based disaster response. It covers five types of natural disasters and two types of man-made disasters across 14 regions worldwide, with a particular focus on developing countries where external assistance is most needed. The optical and SAR imagery in BRIGHT, with a spatial resolution between 0.3-1 meters, provides detailed representations of individual buildings, making it ideal for precise BDA. In our experiments, we have tested seven advanced AI models trained with our BRIGHT to validate the transferability and robustness. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/BRIGHT. BRIGHT also serves as the official dataset for the 2025 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest.

Abstract: Large-scale astronomical image data processing and prediction are essential for astronomers, providing crucial insights into celestial objects, the universe's history, and its evolution. While modern deep learning models offer high predictive accuracy, they often demand substantial computational resources, making them resource-intensive and limiting accessibility. We introduce the Cloud-based Astronomy Inference (CAI) framework to address these challenges. This scalable solution integrates pre-trained foundation models with serverless cloud infrastructure through a Function-as-a-Service (FaaS). CAI enables efficient and scalable inference on astronomical images without extensive hardware. Using a foundation model for redshift prediction as a case study, our extensive experiments cover user devices, HPC (High-Performance Computing) servers, and Cloud. Using redshift prediction with the AstroMAE model demonstrated CAI's scalability and efficiency, achieving inference on a 12.6 GB dataset in only 28 seconds compared to 140.8 seconds on HPC GPUs and 1793 seconds on HPC CPUs. CAI also achieved significantly higher throughput, reaching 18.04 billion bits per second (bps), and maintained near-constant inference times as data sizes increased, all at minimal computational cost (under $5 per experiment). We also process large-scale data up to 1 TB to show CAI's effectiveness at scale. CAI thus provides a highly scalable, accessible, and cost-effective inference solution for the astronomy community. The code is accessible at https://github.com/UVA-MLSys/AI-for-Astronomy.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation (GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$ (progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains. Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/Dramwig/STDW.

Abstract: 3D landmark detection is a critical task in medical image analysis, and accurately detecting anatomical landmarks is essential for subsequent medical imaging tasks. However, mainstream deep learning methods in this field struggle to simultaneously capture fine-grained local features and model global spatial relationships, while maintaining a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Local feature extraction requires capturing fine-grained anatomical details, while global modeling requires understanding the spatial relationships within complex anatomical structures. The high-dimensional nature of 3D volume further exacerbates these challenges, as landmarks are sparsely distributed, leading to significant computational costs. Therefore, achieving efficient and precise 3D landmark detection remains a pressing challenge in medical image analysis.
  In this work, We propose a \textbf{H}ybrid \textbf{3}D \textbf{DE}tection \textbf{Net}(H3DE-Net), a novel framework that combines CNNs for local feature extraction with a lightweight attention mechanism designed to efficiently capture global dependencies in 3D volumetric data. This mechanism employs a hierarchical routing strategy to reduce computational cost while maintaining global context modeling. To our knowledge, H3DE-Net is the first 3D landmark detection model that integrates such a lightweight attention mechanism with CNNs. Additionally, integrating multi-scale feature fusion further enhances detection accuracy and robustness. Experimental results on a public CT dataset demonstrate that H3DE-Net achieves state-of-the-art(SOTA) performance, significantly improving accuracy and robustness, particularly in scenarios with missing landmarks or complex anatomical variations. We aready open-source our project, including code, data and model weights.

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures have become the backbone of both uni-modal and multi-modal foundation models, largely due to their scalability via attention mechanisms, resulting in a rich ecosystem of publicly available pre-trained models such as LLaVA, CLIP, and DeiT, etc. In parallel, emerging sub-quadratic architectures like Mamba offer promising efficiency gains by enabling global context modeling with linear complexity. However, training these architectures from scratch remains resource-intensive (e.g., in terms of data and time). Motivated by this challenge, we explore a cross-architecture knowledge transfer paradigm, termed TransMamba, that facilitates the reuse of Transformer pre-trained knowledge. We propose a two-stage framework to accelerate the training of Mamba-based models, ensuring their effectiveness across both uni-modal and multi-modal tasks. The first stage leverages pre-trained Transformer models to initialize critical components of the Mamba architecture. To bridge architectural and dimensional gaps, we develop a selective weight subcloning strategy and a layered initialization scheme that prioritizes the early $n$ layers. Building on this initialization, the second stage introduces an adaptive multi-directional knowledge distillation method. This mechanism employs layer-wise adaptive scaling factors to align Mamba representations with their Transformer counterparts, while accommodating the scanning order variations inherent to multi-modal Mamba architectures. Despite operating with a reduced training dataset and a more compact model architecture, TransMamba consistently outperforms baseline approaches across diverse mamba-based backbones (e.g., PlainMamba, Vmamba, ViM and VideoMamba) and downstream tasks (e.g., image classification, visual question answering, text-video retrieval and multimodal reasoning). All code and implementation details will be released.

Abstract: This paper's primary objective is to develop a robust generalist perception model capable of addressing multiple tasks under constraints of computational resources and limited training data. We leverage text-to-image diffusion models pre-trained on billions of images and successfully introduce our DICEPTION, a visual generalist model. Exhaustive evaluations demonstrate that DICEPTION effectively tackles diverse perception tasks, even achieving performance comparable to SOTA single-task specialist models. Specifically, we achieve results on par with SAM-vit-h using only 0.06% of their data (e.g., 600K vs.\ 1B pixel-level annotated images). We designed comprehensive experiments on architectures and input paradigms, demonstrating that the key to successfully re-purposing a single diffusion model for multiple perception tasks lies in maximizing the preservation of the pre-trained model's prior knowledge. Consequently, DICEPTION can be trained with substantially lower computational costs than conventional models requiring training from scratch. Furthermore, adapting DICEPTION to novel tasks is highly efficient, necessitating fine-tuning on as few as 50 images and approximately 1% of its parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that a subtle application of classifier-free guidance can improve the model's performance on depth and normal estimation. We also show that pixel-aligned training, as is characteristic of perception tasks, significantly enhances the model's ability to preserve fine details. DICEPTION offers valuable insights and presents a promising direction for the development of advanced diffusion-based visual generalist models. Code and Model: https://github.com/aim-uofa/Diception

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are emerging as a promising alternative to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), offering biological plausibility and energy efficiency. Despite these merits, SNNs are frequently hampered by limited capacity and insufficient representation power, yet remain underexplored in remote sensing super-resolution (SR) tasks. In this paper, we first observe that spiking signals exhibit drastic intensity variations across diverse textures, highlighting an active learning state of the neurons. This observation motivates us to apply SNNs for efficient SR of RSIs. Inspired by the success of attention mechanisms in representing salient information, we devise the spiking attention block (SAB), a concise yet effective component that optimizes membrane potentials through inferred attention weights, which, in turn, regulates spiking activity for superior feature representation. Our key contributions include: 1) we bridge the independent modulation between temporal and channel dimensions, facilitating joint feature correlation learning, and 2) we access the global self-similar patterns in large-scale remote sensing imagery to infer spatial attention weights, incorporating effective priors for realistic and faithful reconstruction. Building upon SAB, we proposed SpikeSR, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across various remote sensing benchmarks such as AID, DOTA, and DIOR, while maintaining high computational efficiency. Code of SpikeSR will be available at https://github.com/XY-boy/SpikeSR.

<title>Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion Guided Refinement of 3D Scenes</title>

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes from a single image is a fundamentally ill-posed task due to the severely under-constrained nature of the problem. Consequently, when the scene is rendered from novel camera views, existing single image to 3D reconstruction methods render incoherent and blurry views. This problem is exacerbated when the unseen regions are far away from the input camera. In this work, we address these inherent limitations in existing single image-to-3D scene feedforward networks. To alleviate the poor performance due to insufficient information beyond the input image's view, we leverage a strong generative prior in the form of a pre-trained latent video diffusion model, for iterative refinement of a coarse scene represented by optimizable Gaussian parameters. To ensure that the style and texture of the generated images align with that of the input image, we incorporate on-the-fly Fourier-style transfer between the generated images and the input image. Additionally, we design a semantic uncertainty quantification module that calculates the per-pixel entropy and yields uncertainty maps used to guide the refinement process from the most confident pixels while discarding the remaining highly uncertain ones. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world scene datasets, including in-domain RealEstate-10K and out-of-domain KITTI-v2, showing that our approach can provide more realistic and high-fidelity novel view synthesis results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Accurate LiDAR-camera calibration is crucial for multi-sensor systems. However, traditional methods often rely on physical targets, which are impractical for real-world deployment. Moreover, even carefully calibrated extrinsics can degrade over time due to sensor drift or external disturbances, necessitating periodic recalibration. To address these challenges, we present a Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration (TLC-Calib) that jointly optimizes sensor poses with a neural Gaussian-based scene representation. Reliable LiDAR points are frozen as anchor Gaussians to preserve global structure, while auxiliary Gaussians prevent local overfitting under noisy initialization. Our fully differentiable pipeline with photometric and geometric regularization achieves robust and generalizable calibration, consistently outperforming existing targetless methods on KITTI-360, Waymo, and FAST-LIVO2, and surpassing even the provided calibrations in rendering quality.

Abstract: Instance segmentation demands costly per-pixel annotations and computationally expensive models. We introduce CAST, a semi-supervised knowledge distillation (SSKD) framework that compresses pre-trained vision foundation models (VFM) into compact experts using limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. CAST unfolds in three stages: (1) domain adaptation of the VFM(s) via self-training with contrastive calibration, (2) knowledge transfer through a unified multi-objective loss, and (3) student refinement to mitigate residual pseudo-label bias. Central to CAST is an \emph{instance-aware pixel-wise contrastive loss} that fuses mask and class scores to extract informative negatives and enforce clear inter-instance margins. By maintaining this contrastive signal across both adaptation and distillation, we align teacher and student embeddings and fully leverage unlabeled images. On Cityscapes and ADE20K, our ~11x smaller student improves over its zero-shot VFM teacher(s) by +8.5 and +7.1 AP, surpasses adapted teacher(s) by +3.4 and +1.5 AP, and further outperforms state-of-the-art SSKD methods on both benchmarks.

Abstract: Document dewarping aims to rectify deformations in photographic document images, thus improving text readability, which has attracted much attention and made great progress, but it is still challenging to preserve document structures. Given recent advances in diffusion models, it is natural for us to consider their potential applicability to document dewarping. However, it is far from straightforward to adopt diffusion models in document dewarping due to their unfaithful control on highly complex document images (e.g., 2000$times$3000 resolution). In this paper, we propose DvD, the first generative model to tackle document Dewarping via a Diffusion framework. To be specific, DvD introduces a coordinate-level denoising instead of typical pixel-level denoising, generating a mapping for deformation rectification. In addition, we further propose a time-variant condition refinement mechanism to enhance the preservation of document structures. In experiments, we find that current document dewarping benchmarks can not evaluate dewarping models comprehensively. To this end, we present AnyPhotoDoc6300, a rigorously designed large-scale document dewarping benchmark comprising 6,300 real image pairs across three distinct domains, enabling fine-grained evaluation of dewarping models. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DvD can achieve state-of-the-art performance with acceptable computational efficiency on multiple metrics across various benchmarks, including DocUNet, DIR300, and AnyPhotoDoc6300. The new benchmark and code will be publicly available at https://github.com/hanquansanren/DvD.

Abstract: Document Image Enhancement (DIE) serves as a critical component in Document AI systems, where its performance substantially determines the effectiveness of downstream tasks. To address the limitations of existing methods confined to single-degradation restoration or grayscale image processing, we present Global with Local Parametric Generation Enhancement Network (GL-PGENet), a novel architecture designed for multi-degraded color document images, ensuring both efficiency and robustness in real-world scenarios. Our solution incorporates three key innovations: First, a hierarchical enhancement framework that integrates global appearance correction with local refinement, enabling coarse-to-fine quality improvement. Second, a Dual-Branch Local-Refine Network with parametric generation mechanisms that replaces conventional direct prediction, producing enhanced outputs through learned intermediate parametric representations rather than pixel-wise mapping. This approach enhances local consistency while improving model generalization. Finally, a modified NestUNet architecture incorporating dense block to effectively fuse low-level pixel features and high-level semantic features, specifically adapted for document image characteristics. In addition, to enhance generalization performance, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: large-scale pretraining on a synthetic dataset of 500,000+ samples followed by task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GL-PGENet, achieving state-of-the-art SSIM scores of 0.7721 on DocUNet and 0.9480 on RealDAE. The model also exhibits remarkable cross-domain adaptability and maintains computational efficiency for high-resolution images without performance degradation, confirming its practical utility in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We tackle the task of any-reference video generation, which aims to synthesize videos conditioned on arbitrary types and combinations of reference subjects, together with textual prompts. This task faces persistent challenges, including identity inconsistency, entanglement among multiple reference subjects, and copy-paste artifacts. To address these issues, we introduce MAGREF, a unified and effective framework for any-reference video generation. Our approach incorporates masked guidance and a subject disentanglement mechanism, enabling flexible synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images and textual prompts. Specifically, masked guidance employs a region-aware masking mechanism combined with pixel-wise channel concatenation to preserve appearance features of multiple subjects along the channel dimension. This design preserves identity consistency and maintains the capabilities of the pre-trained backbone, without requiring any architectural changes. To mitigate subject confusion, we introduce a subject disentanglement mechanism which injects the semantic values of each subject derived from the text condition into its corresponding visual region. Additionally, we establish a four-stage data pipeline to construct diverse training pairs, effectively alleviating copy-paste artifacts. Extensive experiments on a comprehensive benchmark demonstrate that MAGREF consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, paving the way for scalable, controllable, and high-fidelity any-reference video synthesis. Code and model can be found at: https://github.com/MAGREF-Video/MAGREF

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled tool-augmented agents capable of solving complex real-world tasks through step-by-step reasoning. However, existing evaluations often focus on general-purpose or multimodal scenarios, leaving a gap in domain-specific benchmarks that assess tool-use capabilities in complex remote sensing use cases. We present ThinkGeo, an agentic benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-driven agents on remote sensing tasks via structured tool use and multi-step planning. Inspired by tool-interaction paradigms, ThinkGeo includes human-curated queries spanning a wide range of real-world applications such as urban planning, disaster assessment and change analysis, environmental monitoring, transportation analysis, aviation monitoring, recreational infrastructure, and industrial site analysis. Queries are grounded in satellite or aerial imagery, including both optical RGB and SAR data, and require agents to reason through a diverse toolset. We implement a ReAct-style interaction loop and evaluate both open and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Qwen2.5) on 486 structured agentic tasks with 1,773 expert-verified reasoning steps. The benchmark reports both step-wise execution metrics and final answer correctness. Our analysis reveals notable disparities in tool accuracy and planning consistency across models. ThinkGeo provides the first extensive testbed for evaluating how tool-enabled LLMs handle spatial reasoning in remote sensing.

Abstract: Despite advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), their proficiency in fine-grained video motion understanding remains critically limited. They often lack inter-frame differencing and tend to average or ignore subtle visual cues. Furthermore, while visual prompting has shown potential in static images, its application to video's temporal complexities, particularly for fine-grained motion understanding, remains largely unexplored. We investigate whether inherent capability can be unlocked and boost MLLMs' motion perception and enable distinct visual signatures tailored to decouple object and camera motion cues. In this study, we introduce MotionSight, a novel zero-shot method pioneering object-centric visual spotlight and motion blur as visual prompts to effectively improve fine-grained motion understanding without training. To convert this into valuable data assets, we curated MotionVid-QA, the first large-scale dataset for fine-grained video motion understanding, with hierarchical annotations including SFT and preference data, {\Theta}(40K) video clips and {\Theta}(87K) QAs. Experiments show MotionSight achieves state-of-the-art open-source performance and competitiveness with commercial models. In particular, for fine-grained motion understanding we present a novel zero-shot technique and a large-scale, high-quality dataset. All the code and annotations will be publicly available.

Abstract: Recent diffusion models have advanced image editing by improving fidelity and controllability across creative and personalized applications. However, multi-object scenes remain challenging, as reliable control over object categories, counts, and spatial layout is difficult to achieve. For that, we first study quantity and layout consistent image editing, abbreviated as QL-Edit, which targets control of object quantity and spatial layout in multi-object scenes. Then, we present IMAGHarmony, a straightforward framework featuring a plug-and-play harmony aware (HA) module that fuses perception semantics while modeling object counts and locations, resulting in accurate edits and strong structural consistency. We further observe that diffusion models are sensitive to the choice of initial noise and tend to prefer certain noise patterns. Based on this finding, we present a preference-guided noise selection (PNS) strategy that selects semantically aligned initial noise through vision and language matching, thereby further improving generation stability and layout consistency in multiple object editing. To support evaluation, we develop HarmonyBench, a comprehensive benchmark that covers a diverse range of quantity and layout control scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAGHarmony outperforms prior methods in both structural alignment and semantic accuracy, utilizing only 200 training images and 10.6M of trainable parameters. Code, models, and data are available at https://github.com/muzishen/IMAGHarmony.

Abstract: In continual instruction tuning (CIT) scenarios, where new instruction tuning data continuously arrive in an online streaming manner, training delays from large-scale data significantly hinder real-time adaptation. Data selection can mitigate this overhead, but existing strategies often rely on pretrained reference models, which are impractical in CIT setups since future data are unknown. Recent reference model-free online sample selection methods address this, but typically select a fixed number of samples per batch (e.g., top-k), making them vulnerable to distribution shifts where informativeness varies across batches. To address these limitations, we propose OASIS, an adaptive online sample selection approach for CIT that (1) selects informative samples by estimating each sample's informativeness relative to all previously seen data, beyond batch-level constraints, and (2) minimizes informative redundancy of selected samples through iterative selection score updates. Experiments on various large foundation models show that OASIS, using only 25 percent of the data, achieves comparable performance to full-data training and outperforms the state-of-the-art sampling methods.

Abstract: The ability to infer what others are looking at is a critical component of a theory of mind that underpins natural human-AI interaction. We characterized this skill in 111 Vision Language Models (VLMs) and human participants (N = 65) using photos taken with manipulated difficulty and variability. We found that 94 of the 111 VLMs were not better than random guessing, while humans achieved near-ceiling accuracy. VLMs respond with each choice almost equally frequently. Are they randomly guessing? At least for five top-tier VLMs, their performance was above chance, declined with increasing task difficulty, but barely varied across different prompts and scene objects. These behavioral patterns cannot be explained by considering VLMs as random guessers. Instead, they likely utilize head orientation but not eye appearance to infer gaze direction, such that their performance is imperfect, subject to the task difficulty, but robust to superficial perceptual variations. This suggests that VLMs, lacking effective gaze inference skills, have yet to become technologies that can naturally interact with humans, but the potential remains.

Abstract: While Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has become standard for improving sample fidelity in conditional diffusion models, it can harm diversity and induce memorization by applying constant guidance regardless of whether a particular sample needs correction. We propose FeedBack Guidance (FBG), which uses a state-dependent coefficient to self-regulate guidance amounts based on need. Our approach is derived from first principles by assuming the learned conditional distribution is linearly corrupted by the unconditional distribution, contrasting with CFG's implicit multiplicative assumption. Our scheme relies on feedback of its own predictions about the conditional signal informativeness to adapt guidance dynamically during inference, challenging the view of guidance as a fixed hyperparameter. The approach is benchmarked on ImageNet512x512, where it significantly outperforms Classifier-Free Guidance and is competitive to Limited Interval Guidance (LIG) while benefitting from a strong mathematical framework. On Text-To-Image generation, we demonstrate that, as anticipated, our approach automatically applies higher guidance scales for complex prompts than for simpler ones and that it can be easily combined with existing guidance schemes such as CFG or LIG.

Abstract: Developing reasoning capabilities in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains challenging. Motivated by literature suggesting that gameplay promotes transferable reasoning skills, we propose a novel post-training method, Visual Game Learning (ViGaL), where MLLMs develop generalizable reasoning skills through playing arcade-like games. Specifically, we show that training a 7B-parameter MLLM via reinforcement learning (RL) on simple games like Snake significantly enhances the downstream performance on multimodal math benchmarks like MathVista, on multi-discipline questions like MMMU and on 3D spatial reasoning benchmarks like VSI-Bench, without seeing any worked solutions, equations, or diagrams during RL. Remarkably, our model outperforms specialist models post-trained on benchmark-oriented multimodal reasoning data, while preserving the model's performance on general visual benchmarks, a challenge where specialist models often fall short. Our findings suggest that multimodal reasoning can emerge from gameplay, pointing to a promising strategy of designing surrogate tasks for RL post-training.

Integrating diverse knowledge from multiple sources -- including visual generative models, visual language models, and sources with human-crafted knowledge such as graphics engines and physics simulators -- remains under-explored. We propose a Product of Experts (PoE) framework that performs inference-time knowledge composition from heterogeneous models. This training-free approach samples from the product distribution across experts via Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). Our framework shows practical benefits in image and video synthesis tasks, yielding better controllability than monolithic methods and additionally providing flexible user interfaces for specifying visual generation goals.

Abstract: Long-video understanding~(LVU) is a challenging problem in computer vision. Existing methods either downsample frames for single-pass reasoning, sacrificing fine-grained details, or depend on textual reasoning over task-agnostic representations, hindering task-specific perception and exploration. In this paper, we propose VideoExplorer, a framework grounded in the principle of ``thinking with video'', which naturally intertwines planning, temporal grounding, and scalable perception into a coherent reasoning process. Rather than reasoning over a static context, VideoExplorer iteratively formulates sub-questions, locates relevant moments, and performs task-oriented, temporally scalable video understanding until reaching the final answer, enabling faithful, efficient, and interpretable reasoning. To address the lack of LVU training resources, we construct a long-video reasoning dataset using difficulty-adaptive sampling to ensure high-quality trajectories on complex tasks. Building on this dataset, we design a two-stage training pipeline: supervised trajectory initialization followed by trajectory-level preference optimization, encouraging adaptive temporal grounding and iterative information integration guided by downstream rewards. Extensive evaluations on popular long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks demonstrate VideoExplorer's significant advantage over existing baselines, highlighting its robustness, adaptability, and efficiency. Our code is made publicly available in this repository(https://github.com/yhy-2000/VideoDeepResearch).

Abstract: We introduce the largest real-world image deblurring dataset constructed from smartphone slow-motion videos. Using 240 frames captured over one second, we simulate realistic long-exposure blur by averaging frames to produce blurry images, while using the temporally centered frame as the sharp reference. Our dataset contains over 42,000 high-resolution blur-sharp image pairs, making it approximately 10 times larger than widely used datasets, with 8 times the amount of different scenes, including indoor and outdoor environments, with varying object and camera motions. We benchmark multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) deblurring models on our dataset and observe significant performance degradation, highlighting the complexity and diversity of our benchmark. Our dataset serves as a challenging new benchmark to facilitate robust and generalizable deblurring models.

Abstract: Humans often use visual aids, for example diagrams or sketches, when solving complex problems. Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual Chain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf visual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack of high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a diverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent interleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks where sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific questions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks like visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D multi-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and strategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT training corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and yields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations. Fine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved visual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing multimodal reasoning abilities. We open-source our dataset and models to support development and evaluation of visual CoT.

Abstract: Video data, especially long-form video, is extremely dense and high-dimensional. Text-based summaries of video content offer a way to represent query-relevant content in a much more compact manner than raw video. In addition, textual representations are easily ingested by state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), which enable reasoning over video content to answer complex natural language queries. To solve this issue, we rely on the progressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating on shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is computationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the activity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video captions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to other information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene descriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding system relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer questions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the video into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more accurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we incorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA VLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the space of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we have successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action and scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning pipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks. Our model, controllable hybrid captioner, can alternate between different types of captions according to special input tokens that signals scene changes detected in the video.

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information and global context, effectively mitigating interference from category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/AlignCAT.

Abstract: Recent studies have indicated that vision models pre-trained on images can serve as time series foundation models (TSFMs) by reformulating time series forecasting (TSF) as image reconstruction. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time series remains challenging due to three discrepancies: (1) the data-modality gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time series; (2) the multivariate-forecasting gap between fixed RGB-three-channel vision models and time series with arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) the probabilistic-forecasting gap between the deterministic outputs of vision models and the requirement for uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose VisonTS++, a TSFM based on continual pre-training of a vision model on large-scale time series. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) vision-model-based filtering to identify high-quality sequences to stabilize pre-training and mitigate modality gap; (2) colorized multivariate conversion, encoding multivariate series as multi-subfigure RGB images to enhance cross-variate modeling; (3) multi-quantile forecasting, using parallel reconstruction heads to generate quantile forecasts without parametric assumptions. Experiments show that VisionTS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution forecasting, outperforming specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in GIFT-Eval benchmark which comprises 23 datasets across 7 domains. Our work demonstrates that with appropriate adaptation, vision models can effectively generalize to TSF, thus advancing the pursuit of universal TSFMs. Code is available at https://github.com/HALF111/VisionTSpp.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient Video Quality Assessment (VQA) has long been a key research challenge. Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve performance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g., ImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this strategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic knowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality depends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics); (2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational resources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training directly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and have begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this work, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP enhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal Adapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters and is the only component that requires training. This design significantly reduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable quality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality variations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies on VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to better generalization performance across datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-CLIP exhibits excellent performance on several VQA datasets.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we propose MAViS, a multi-agent collaborative framework designed to assist in long-sequence video storytelling by efficiently translating ideas into visual narratives. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling, keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage, agents operate under the 3E Principle--Explore, Examine, and Enhanc--to ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools. Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness. Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative models and tools. With just a brief idea description, MAViS enables users to rapidly explore diverse visual storytelling and creative directions for sequential video generation by efficiently producing high-quality, complete long-sequence videos. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with narratives and background music.

Abstract: We present MInDI-3D (Medical Inversion by Direct Iteration in 3D), the first 3D conditional diffusion-based model for real-world sparse-view Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) artefact removal, aiming to reduce imaging radiation exposure. A key contribution is extending the "InDI" concept from 2D to a full 3D volumetric approach for medical images, implementing an iterative denoising process that refines the CBCT volume directly from sparse-view input. A further contribution is the generation of a large pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182) from chest CT volumes of the CT-RATE public dataset to robustly train MInDI-3D. We performed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics, scalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11 clinicians. Our results show MInDI-3D's effectiveness, achieving a 12.96 (6.10) dB PSNR gain over uncorrected scans with only 50 projections on the CT-RATE pseudo-CBCT (independent real-world) test set and enabling an 8x reduction in imaging radiation exposure. We demonstrate its scalability by showing that performance improves with more training data. Importantly, MInDI-3D matches the performance of a 3D U-Net on real-world scans from 16 cancer patients across distortion and task-based metrics. It also generalises to new CBCT scanner geometries. Clinicians rated our model as sufficient for patient positioning across all anatomical sites and found it preserved lung tumour boundaries well.

Abstract: We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and auditory inputs to build and update episodic and semantic memories, gradually accumulating world knowledge. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal manner, enabling deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment. Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn reasoning and retrieves relevant memories to complete tasks. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal agents, we develop M3-Bench, a long-video question answering benchmark comprising 100 newly recorded robot-perspective videos (M3-Bench-robot) and 920 diverse web-sourced videos (M3-Bench-web). We annotate QA pairs designed to test capabilities essential for agent applications, such as person understanding, general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o, achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web and VideoMME-long, respectively. Our work advances multimodal agents toward more human-like long-term memory and provides insights for their practical design.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning holds great promise for remote sensing, but standard self-supervised methods must be adapted to the unique characteristics of Earth observation data. We take a step in this direction by conducting a comprehensive benchmark of fusion strategies and normalization schemes of reconstruction targets for multimodal, multitemporal, and multispectral Earth observation data. Based on our findings, we introduce MAESTRO, a novel adaptation of the Masked Autoencoder with optimized fusion mechanisms and a normalization scheme that incorporates a spectral prior as a self-supervisory signal. Evaluated on four Earth observation datasets in both intra- and cross-dataset settings, MAESTRO achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks that strongly rely on multitemporal dynamics, while also remaining competitive on others. Code to reproduce all our experiments is available at https://github.com/ignf/maestro.

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems, limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

Abstract: The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition, leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation (UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert (CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and effectiveness. The code has been uploaded to https://github.com/gavin-gqzhang/UniGen.

Abstract: Despite the advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models, their potential for misuse or even abuse raises serious safety concerns. Model developers have made tremendous efforts to introduce safety mechanisms that can address these concerns in T2I models. However, the existing safety mechanisms, whether external or internal, either remain susceptible to evasion under distribution shifts or require extensive model-specific adjustments. To address these limitations, we introduce Safe-Control, an innovative plug-and-play safety patch designed to mitigate unsafe content generation in T2I models. Using data-driven strategies and safety-aware conditions, Safe-Control injects safety control signals into the locked T2I model, acting as an update in a patch-like manner. Model developers can also construct various safety patches to meet the evolving safety requirements, which can be flexibly merged into a single, unified patch. Its plug-and-play design further ensures adaptability, making it compatible with other T2I models of similar denoising architecture. We conduct extensive evaluations on six diverse and public T2I models. Empirical results highlight that Safe-Control is effective in reducing unsafe content generation across six diverse T2I models with similar generative architectures, yet it successfully maintains the quality and text alignment of benign images. Compared to seven state-of-the-art safety mechanisms, including both external and internal defenses, Safe-Control significantly outperforms all baselines in reducing unsafe content generation. For example, it reduces the probability of unsafe content generation to 7%, compared to approximately 20% for most baseline methods, under both unsafe prompts and the latest adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Evaluating domain generalization (DG) for foundational models like CLIP is challenging, as web-scale pretraining data potentially covers many existing benchmarks. Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently challenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better assess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP encounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating on 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after fine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget' some domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance deteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present CLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware representations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while standard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant, this can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of domain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead hypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective domain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and enhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head and synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages domain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain features. CLIP-DCA shows significant improvements within this challenging evaluation compared to existing methods, particularly on datasets that are more OOD.

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models, specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method, Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO and Dance-GRPO.

Abstract: Bone health studies are crucial in medical practice for the early detection and treatment of Osteopenia and Osteoporosis. Clinicians usually make a diagnosis based on densitometry (DEXA scans) and patient history. The applications of AI in this field are ongoing research. Most successful methods rely on deep learning models that use vision alone (DEXA/X-ray imagery) and focus on prediction accuracy, while explainability is often disregarded and left to post hoc assessments of input contributions. We propose ProtoMedX, a multi-modal (multimodal) model that uses both DEXA scans of the lumbar spine and patient records. ProtoMedX's prototype-based architecture is explainable by design, which is crucial for medical applications, especially in the context of the upcoming EU AI Act, as it allows explicit analysis of model decisions, including incorrect ones. ProtoMedX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in bone health classification while also providing explanations that can be visually understood by clinicians. Using a dataset of 4,160 real NHS patients, the proposed ProtoMedX achieves 87.58% accuracy in vision-only tasks and 89.8% in its multi-modal variant, both surpassing existing published methods.

Abstract: Numerous models have been developed for scanpath and saliency prediction, which are typically trained on scanpaths, which model eye movement as a sequence of discrete fixation points connected by saccades, while the rich information contained in the raw trajectories is often discarded. Moreover, most existing approaches fail to capture the variability observed among human subjects viewing the same image. They generally predict a single scanpath of fixed, pre-defined length, which conflicts with the inherent diversity and stochastic nature of real-world visual attention. To address these challenges, we propose DiffEye, a diffusion-based training framework designed to model continuous and diverse eye movement trajectories during free viewing of natural images. Our method builds on a diffusion model conditioned on visual stimuli and introduces a novel component, namely Corresponding Positional Embedding (CPE), which aligns spatial gaze information with the patch-based semantic features of the visual input. By leveraging raw eye-tracking trajectories rather than relying on scanpaths, DiffEye captures the inherent variability in human gaze behavior and generates high-quality, realistic eye movement patterns, despite being trained on a comparatively small dataset. The generated trajectories can also be converted into scanpaths and saliency maps, resulting in outputs that more accurately reflect the distribution of human visual attention. DiffEye is the first method to tackle this task on natural images using a diffusion model while fully leveraging the richness of raw eye-tracking data. Our extensive evaluation shows that DiffEye not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in scanpath generation but also enables, for the first time, the generation of continuous eye movement trajectories.

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video, which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs) and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights. Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found in https://github.com/iamsnaping/ProDA.git

Abstract: We present LLaVA-OneVision-1.5, a novel family of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that achieve state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computational and financial costs. Different from the existing works, LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 provides an open, efficient, and reproducible framework for building high-quality vision-language models entirely from scratch. The LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 release comprises three primary components: (1) Large-Scale Curated Datasets: We construct an 85M concept-balanced pretraining dataset LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Mid-Traning and a meticulously curated 22M instruction dataset LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Instruct. (2) Efficient Training Framework: We develop a complete end-to-end efficient training framework leveraging an offline parallel data packing strategy to facilitate the training of LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 within a $16,000 budget. (3) State-of-the-art Performance: Experimental results demonstrate that LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 yields exceptionally competitive performance across a broad range of downstream tasks. Specifically, LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-8B outperforms Qwen2.5-VL-7B on 18 of 27 benchmarks, and LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-4B surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-3B on all 27 benchmarks. We anticipate releasing LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-RL shortly and encourage the community to await further updates.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance. Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the 1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks. Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher inference efficiency.

Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics, supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We propose a novel method for training a neural network for image classification to reduce input data dynamically, in order to reduce the costs of training a neural network model. As Deep Learning tasks become more popular, their computational complexity increases, leading to more intricate algorithms and models which have longer runtimes and require more input data. The result is a greater cost on time, hardware, and environmental resources. By using data reduction techniques, we reduce the amount of work performed, and therefore the environmental impact of AI techniques, and with dynamic data reduction we show that accuracy may be maintained while reducing runtime by up to 50%, and reducing carbon emission proportionally.

<title>ManipGPT: Is Affordance Segmentation by Large Vision Models Enough for Articulated Object Manipulation?</title>

Abstract: Visual actionable affordance has emerged as a transformative approach in robotics, focusing on perceiving interaction areas prior to manipulation. Traditional methods rely on pixel sampling to identify successful interaction samples or processing pointclouds for affordance mapping. However, these approaches are computationally intensive and struggle to adapt to diverse and dynamic environments. This paper introduces ManipGPT, a framework designed to predict optimal interaction areas for articulated objects using a large pre-trained vision transformer (ViT). We create a dataset of 9.9k simulated and real images to bridge the visual sim-to-real gap and enhance real-world applicability. By fine-tuning the vision transformer on this small dataset, we significantly improve part-level affordance segmentation, adapting the model's in-context segmentation capabilities to robot manipulation scenarios. This enables effective manipulation across simulated and real-world environments by generating part-level affordance masks, paired with an impedance adaptation policy, sufficiently eliminating the need for complex datasets or perception systems.

<title>SiLVR: Scalable Lidar-Visual Radiance Field Reconstruction with Uncertainty Quantification</title>

Abstract: We present a neural radiance field (NeRF) based large-scale reconstruction system that fuses lidar and vision data to generate high-quality reconstructions that are geometrically accurate and capture photorealistic texture. Our system adopts the state-of-the-art NeRF representation to incorporate lidar. Adding lidar data adds strong geometric constraints on the depth and surface normals, which is particularly useful when modelling uniform texture surfaces which contain ambiguous visual reconstruction cues. A key contribution of this work is a novel method to quantify the epistemic uncertainty of the lidar-visual NeRF reconstruction by estimating the spatial variance of each point location in the radiance field given the sensor observations from the cameras and lidar. This provides a principled approach to evaluate the contribution of each sensor modality to the final reconstruction. In this way, reconstructions that are uncertain (due to e.g. uniform visual texture, limited observation viewpoints, or little lidar coverage) can be identified and removed. Our system is integrated with a real-time lidar SLAM system which is used to bootstrap a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) reconstruction procedure. It also helps to properly constrain the overall metric scale which is essential for the lidar depth loss. The refined SLAM trajectory can then be divided into submaps using Spectral Clustering to group sets of co-visible images together. This submapping approach is more suitable for visual reconstruction than distance-based partitioning. Our uncertainty estimation is particularly effective when merging submaps as their boundaries often contain artefacts due to limited observations. We demonstrate the reconstruction system using a multi-camera, lidar sensor suite in experiments involving both robot-mounted and handheld scanning. Our test datasets cover a total area of more than 20,000 square metres.

Abstract: Category-selective regions in the human brain-such as the fusiform face area (FFA), extrastriate body area (EBA), parahippocampal place area (PPA), and visual word form area (VWFA)-support high-level visual recognition. Here, we investigate whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) exhibit analogous category-selective neurons and how these representations are shaped by language experience. Using an fMRI-inspired functional localizer approach, we identified face-, body-, place-, and word-selective neurons in deep networks presented with category images and scrambled controls. Both the purely visual ResNet and a linguistically supervised Lang-Learned ResNet contained category-selective neurons that increased in proportion across layers. However, compared to the vision-only model, the Lang-Learned ResNet showed a greater number but lower specificity of category-selective neurons, along with reduced spatial localization and attenuated activation strength-indicating a shift toward more distributed, semantically aligned coding. These effects were replicated in the large-scale vision-language model CLIP. Together, our findings reveal that language experience systematically reorganizes visual category representations in ANNs, providing a computational parallel to how linguistic context may shape categorical organization in the human brain.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach to fMRI-based visual image reconstruction using a subject-agnostic common representation space. We show that the brain signals of the subjects can be aligned in this common space during training to form a semantically aligned common brain. This is leveraged to demonstrate that aligning subject-specific lightweight modules to a reference subject is significantly more efficient than traditional end-to-end training methods. Our approach excels in low-data scenarios. We evaluate our methods on different datasets, demonstrating that the common space is subject and dataset-agnostic.

<title>Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization of Large Multimodal Models by Adversarial Negative Mining</title>

Abstract: The task adaptation and alignment of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have been significantly advanced by instruction tuning and further strengthened by recent preference optimization. Yet, most LMMs still suffer from severe modality imbalance during reasoning, i.e., outweighing language prior biases over visual inputs, which bottlenecks their generalization to downstream tasks and causes hallucinations. However, existing preference optimization approaches for LMMs do not focus on restraining the internal biases of their Large Language Model (LLM) backbones when curating the training data. Moreover, they heavily rely on offline data and lack the capacity to explore diverse responses adaptive to dynamic distributional shifts during training. Meanwhile, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent method using online-generated data and verified rewards to improve reasoning capabilities, remains largely underexplored in LMM alignment. In this paper, we propose a novel preference learning framework, Modality-Balancing Preference Optimization (MBPO), to address the modality imbalance in LMMs. MBPO constructs a more effective offline preference dataset by generating hard negatives, i.e., rejected responses misled by LLM biases due to limited usage of visual information, through adversarial perturbation of input images. Moreover, MBPO leverages the easy-to-verify nature of close-ended tasks to generate online responses with verified rewards. GRPO is then employed to train the model with offline-online hybrid data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MBPO can enhance LMM performance on challenging vision-language tasks and effectively reduce hallucinations.

Abstract: Mammography is the gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level) contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This design enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840 pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of classification models and extended to anomaly segmentation. Experiments, both numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image generation, super-resolution, and anomaly segmentation, highlighting its potential to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion detection.

Abstract: Medical image classification requires not only high predictive performance but also interpretability to ensure clinical trust and adoption. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful framework for modeling relational structures within datasets; however, standard GNNs often operate as black boxes, limiting transparency and usability, particularly in clinical settings. In this work, we present an interpretable graph-based learning framework named FireGNN that integrates trainable fuzzy rules into GNNs for medical image classification. These rules embed topological descriptors - node degree, clustering coefficient, and label agreement - using learnable thresholds and sharpness parameters to enable intrinsic symbolic reasoning. Additionally, we explore auxiliary self-supervised tasks (e.g., homophily prediction, similarity entropy) as a benchmark to evaluate the contribution of topological learning. Our fuzzy-rule-enhanced model achieves strong performance across five MedMNIST benchmarks and the synthetic dataset MorphoMNIST, while also generating interpretable rule-based explanations. To our knowledge, this is the first integration of trainable fuzzy rules within a GNN. Source Code: https://github.com/basiralab/FireGNN

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks, yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL) recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL. At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth. To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb over-confidence.

Abstract: In the field of railway automation, one of the key challenges has been the development of effective computer vision systems due to the limited availability of high-quality, sequential data. Traditional datasets are restricted in scope, lacking the spatio temporal context necessary for real-time decision-making, while alternative solutions introduce issues related to realism and applicability. By focusing on route-specific, contextually relevant cues, we can generate rich, sequential datasets that align more closely with real-world operational logic. The concept of milestone determination allows for the development of targeted, rule-based models that simplify the learning process by eliminating the need for generalized recognition of dynamic components, focusing instead on the critical decision points along a route. We argue that this approach provides a practical framework for training vision agents in controlled, predictable environments, facilitating safer and more efficient machine learning systems for railway automation.

A benchmark called CML-Bench was proposed, featuring quantitative metrics across these dimensions to evaluate script quality. Additionally, a prompting strategy named CML-Instruction was introduced to guide LLMs in generating more structured and cinematically sound scripts. Experiments showed that LLMs guided by CML-Instruction produced higher-quality screenplays aligned with human preferences. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating highly structured texts. However, while exhibiting a high degree of structural organization, movie scripts demand an additional layer of nuanced storytelling and emotional depth-the 'soul' of compelling cinema-that LLMs often fail to capture. To investigate this deficiency, we first curated CML-Dataset, a dataset comprising (summary, content) pairs for Cinematic Markup Language (CML), where 'content' consists of segments from esteemed, high-quality movie scripts and 'summary' is a concise description of the content. Through an in-depth analysis of the intrinsic multi-shot continuity and narrative structures within these authentic scripts, we identified three pivotal dimensions for quality assessment: Dialogue Coherence (DC), Character Consistency (CC), and Plot Reasonableness (PR). Informed by these findings, we propose the CML-Bench, featuring quantitative metrics across these dimensions. CML-Bench effectively assigns high scores to well-crafted, human-written scripts while concurrently pinpointing the weaknesses in screenplays generated by LLMs. To further validate our benchmark, we introduce CML-Instruction, a prompting strategy with detailed instructions on character dialogue and event logic, to guide LLMs to generate more structured and cinematically sound scripts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our benchmark and demonstrate that LLMs guided by CML-Instruction generate higher-quality screenplays, with results aligned with human preferences.

Abstract: This article is inspired by video classification technology. If the user behavior subspace is viewed as a frame image, consecutive frame images are viewed as a video. Following this novel idea, a model for spammer detection based on user videoization, called UVSD, is proposed. Firstly, a user2piexl algorithm for user pixelization is proposed. Considering the adversarial behavior of user stances, the user is viewed as a pixel, and the stance is quantified as the pixel's RGB. Secondly, a behavior2image algorithm is proposed for transforming user behavior subspace into frame images. Low-rank dense vectorization of subspace user relations is performed using representation learning, while cutting and diffusion algorithms are introduced to complete the frame imageization. Finally, user behavior videos are constructed based on temporal features. Subsequently, a video classification algorithm is combined to identify the spammers. Experiments using publicly available datasets, i.e., WEIBO and TWITTER, show an advantage of the UVSD model over state-of-the-art methods.

However, deterministic neural networks can be vulnerable to noisy conditions and adversarial attacks, leading to missed detection or misclassification. This study introduces the idea of uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout, integrated into a fine-tuned ResNet-50 architecture for surface landmine and UXO classification, which was tested on a simulated dataset. Integrating the MC Dropout approach helps quantify epistemic uncertainty, providing an additional metric for prediction reliability, which could be helpful to make more informed decisions in demining operations. Experimental results on clean, adversarially perturbed, and noisy test images demonstrate the model's ability to flag unreliable predictions under challenging conditions. This proof-of-concept study highlights the need for uncertainty quantification in demining, raises awareness about the vulnerability of existing neural networks in demining to adversarial threats, and emphasizes the importance of developing more robust and reliable models for practical applications.

<div> Keywords: imaging modalities, intravascular imaging, CCTA, coronary models, multimodars <br />
<br />
Summary: 
Combining imaging modalities such as intravascular imaging and CCTA is crucial for creating accurate 3D coronary models. While intravascular imaging provides high resolution, it lacks whole-vessel context, which is offered by CCTA. However, CCTA can suffer from limited resolution and artefacts. Previous methods have fused intravascular and CCTA data, but there was a need for a flexible toolkit optimized for multi-state analysis and reproducibility. The multimodars package addresses this need with deterministic alignment algorithms, a compact data model centered around NumPy, and an optimized Rust backend for scalable and reproducible experiments. This package can handle inputs in CSV or NumPy format, including those generated by the AIVUS-CAA software. <div>

Abstract: Combining complementary imaging modalities is critical to build reliable 3D coronary models: intravascular imaging gives sub-millimetre resolution but limited whole-vessel context, while CCTA supplies 3D geometry but suffers from limited spatial resolution and artefacts (e.g., blooming). Prior work demonstrated intravascular/CCTA fusion, yet no open, flexible toolkit is tailored for multi-state analysis (rest/stress, pre-/post-stenting) while offering deterministic behaviour, high performance, and easy pipeline integration. multimodars addresses this gap with deterministic alignment algorithms, a compact NumPy-centred data model, and an optimised Rust backend suitable for scalable, reproducible experiments. The package accepts CSV/NumPy inputs including data formats produced by the AIVUS-CAA software

<div> benchmarking, physical simulation, vision-language models, physics reasoning, diagnostic subtests

Summary:
- Leading Vision-Language Models (VLMs) were evaluated on three physical simulation datasets to assess their ability in predicting outcomes and hypothesizing about alternative situations.
- Diagnostic subtests were designed to separate perception and physics reasoning skills, with the expectation that stronger performance in these areas would lead to better evaluation accuracy.
- Weak correlations were observed between perception and physics reasoning skills and performance in predictive or counterfactual evaluation tasks.
- Current VLMs struggle to combine perceptual and physics skills into a cohesive understanding of causality.
- The study highlights the need for architectures that tightly integrate perception and reasoning in vision-language models.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leading Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show strong results in visual perception and general reasoning, but their ability to understand and predict physical dynamics remains unclear. We benchmark six frontier VLMs on three physical simulation datasets - CLEVRER, Physion, and Physion++ - where the evaluation tasks test whether a model can predict outcomes or hypothesize about alternative situations. To probe deeper, we design diagnostic subtests that isolate perception (objects, colors, occluders) from physics reasoning (motion prediction, spatial relations). Intuitively, stronger diagnostic performance should support higher evaluation accuracy. Yet our analysis reveals weak correlations: models that excel at perception or physics reasoning do not consistently perform better on predictive or counterfactual evaluation. This counterintuitive gap exposes a central limitation of current VLMs: perceptual and physics skills remain fragmented and fail to combine into causal understanding, underscoring the need for architectures that bind perception and reasoning more tightly.

<div> Keywords: Spiking Neural Networks, Neuromorphic hardware, Self-distillation framework, Rate-based backpropagation, High-performance training

Summary: 
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are energy-efficient due to sparse activation patterns but conventional training methods like BPTT have drawbacks. A new self-distillation framework optimized with rate-based backpropagation aims to enhance SNN training within limited resources. Intermediate SNN layer firing rates are projected onto lightweight ANN branches for optimization. Decoupling the teacher signal into reliable and unreliable components ensures only reliable knowledge guides model optimization. Results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet show reduced training complexity and high-performance SNN training. The code is available on GitHub for reproducibility. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit exceptional energy efficiency on neuromorphic hardware due to their sparse activation patterns. However, conventional training methods based on surrogate gradients and Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) not only lag behind Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in performance, but also incur significant computational and memory overheads that grow linearly with the temporal dimension. To enable high-performance SNN training under limited computational resources, we propose an enhanced self-distillation framework, jointly optimized with rate-based backpropagation. Specifically, the firing rates of intermediate SNN layers are projected onto lightweight ANN branches, and high-quality knowledge generated by the model itself is used to optimize substructures through the ANN pathways. Unlike traditional self-distillation paradigms, we observe that low-quality self-generated knowledge may hinder convergence. To address this, we decouple the teacher signal into reliable and unreliable components, ensuring that only reliable knowledge is used to guide the optimization of the model. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CIFAR10-DVS, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method reduces training complexity while achieving high-performance SNN training. Our code is available at https://github.com/Intelli-Chip-Lab/enhanced-self-distillation-framework-for-snn.

<div> Keywords: Cutaneous malignancies, AI integration, heterogeneous ensemble, language model capabilities, patient-centered education

Summary: 
Cutaneous malignancies necessitate early detection, but current diagnostics are hindered by variability and access issues. This study introduces a novel framework for dermatological AI diagnostics that addresses these challenges through two key innovations. Firstly, a diverse ensemble of convolutional neural networks provides complementary diagnostic perspectives and flags uncertain cases for specialist review. Secondly, language model capabilities are integrated directly into the diagnostic workflow, generating structured reports with precise lesion characterization and patient-centric education. This integration aims to improve diagnostic reliability and communication barriers, bridging the gap for impactful AI implementation in dermatology. The framework offers enhanced diagnostic precision, supports patient education, and aims to improve early intervention rates for skin lesions.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cutaneous malignancies demand early detection for favorable outcomes, yet current diagnostics suffer from inter-observer variability and access disparities. While AI shows promise, existing dermatological systems are limited by homogeneous architectures, dataset biases across skin tones, and fragmented approaches that treat natural language processing as separate post-hoc explanations rather than integral to clinical decision-making. We introduce a unified framework that fundamentally reimagines AI integration for dermatological diagnostics through two synergistic innovations. First, a purposefully heterogeneous ensemble of architecturally diverse convolutional neural networks provides complementary diagnostic perspectives, with an intrinsic uncertainty mechanism flagging discordant cases for specialist review -- mimicking clinical best practices. Second, we embed large language model capabilities directly into the diagnostic workflow, transforming classification outputs into clinically meaningful assessments that simultaneously fulfill medical documentation requirements and deliver patient-centered education. This seamless integration generates structured reports featuring precise lesion characterization, accessible diagnostic reasoning, and actionable monitoring guidance -- empowering patients to recognize early warning signs between visits. By addressing both diagnostic reliability and communication barriers within a single cohesive system, our approach bridges the critical translational gap that has prevented previous AI implementations from achieving clinical impact. The framework represents a significant advancement toward deployable dermatological AI that enhances diagnostic precision while actively supporting the continuum of care from initial detection through patient education, ultimately improving early intervention rates for skin lesions.

Summary:<br />
The study aims to improve the detection of gravitational waves by classifying glitches in LIGO data using the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The researchers trained a pre-trained ViT-B/32 model on a combined dataset from the Gravity Spy project and two additional noise classes from the LIGO O3a run. The model achieved a high classification efficiency of 92.26%, indicating the potential of ViT in accurately distinguishing transient noise events. By expanding the classification to include 22 existing classes and the additional noise classes, the study addresses the challenges posed by transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data. The findings suggest that the ViT model can enhance the accuracy of gravitational wave detection and contribute to more effective classification of noise events in gravitational wave signals. <div>

Abstract: Transient noise (glitches) in LIGO data hinders the detection of gravitational waves (GW). The Gravity Spy project has categorized these noise events into various classes. With the O3 run, there is the inclusion of two additional noise classes and thus a need to train new models for effective classification. We aim to classify glitches in LIGO data into 22 existing classes from the first run plus 2 additional noise classes from O3a using the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. We train a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT-B/32) model on a combined dataset consisting of the Gravity Spy dataset with the additional two classes from the LIGO O3a run. We achieve a classification efficiency of 92.26%, demonstrating the potential of Vision Transformer to improve the accuracy of gravitational wave detection by effectively distinguishing transient noise.

<div> Keywords: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning, mask-based representation, object-agnostic cues, dense rewards, sim-to-real transfer

Summary:<br />
Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) aims to enable agents to learn diverse objectives using a unified policy. The success of GCRL hinges on the choice of goal representation, with existing methods facing challenges such as poor generalization and slow convergence. In this work, a mask-based representation system is proposed, providing object-agnostic visual cues to agents for efficient learning and superior generalization. By processing masks, dense rewards can be generated without the need for error-prone distance calculations. Through learning with ground truth masks in simulation, the method achieved 99.9% reaching accuracy on both training and unseen test objects. This approach enables high-accuracy pick-up tasks without positional information of the target and can be applied to sim-to-real transfer tasks using pretrained object detection models. <div>

Abstract: Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) allows agents to learn diverse objectives using a unified policy. The success of GCRL, however, is contingent on the choice of goal representation. In this work, we propose a mask-based goal representation system that provides object-agnostic visual cues to the agent, enabling efficient learning and superior generalization. In contrast, existing goal representation methods, such as target state images, 3D coordinates, and one-hot vectors, face issues of poor generalization to unseen objects, slow convergence, and the need for special cameras. Masks can be processed to generate dense rewards without requiring error-prone distance calculations. Learning with ground truth masks in simulation, we achieved 99.9% reaching accuracy on training and unseen test objects. Our proposed method can be utilized to perform pick-up tasks with high accuracy, without using any positional information of the target. Moreover, we demonstrate learning from scratch and sim-to-real transfer applications using two different physical robots, utilizing pretrained open vocabulary object detection models for mask generation.

Summary: 
This study introduces a GAN-based superresolution method to enhance low-resolution full-disk H$\alpha$ solar images from GONG to achieve high-resolution quality comparable to BBSO/GST observations. The model utilizes Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a relativistic discriminator and carefully aligns image pairs for effective reconstruction.

The average MSE is 467.15, RMSE is 21.59, and CC is 0.7794. However, slight misalignments between image pairs affect quantitative performance, prompting future work on alignment refinement and dataset expansion for enhanced reconstruction quality. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) solar imaging is crucial for capturing fine-scale dynamic features such as filaments and fibrils. However, the spatial resolution of the full-disk H$\alpha$ images is limited and insufficient to resolve these small-scale structures. To address this, we propose a GAN-based superresolution approach to enhance low-resolution (LR) full-disk H$\alpha$ images from the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) to a quality comparable with HR observations from the Big Bear Solar Observatory/Goode Solar Telescope (BBSO/GST). We employ Real-ESRGAN with Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks and a relativistic discriminator. We carefully aligned GONG-GST pairs. The model effectively recovers fine details within sunspot penumbrae and resolves fine details in filaments and fibrils, achieving an average mean squared error (MSE) of 467.15, root mean squared error (RMSE) of 21.59, and cross-correlation (CC) of 0.7794. Slight misalignments between image pairs limit quantitative performance, which we plan to address in future work alongside dataset expansion to further improve reconstruction quality.

<div> hallucination, relation, LVLMs, ChainMPQ, multimodal  
Summary:  
ChainMPQ is a new method designed to improve relational inference in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by addressing relation hallucinations. It uses subject and object keywords from questions to enhance image regions and constructs multi-perspective questions focusing on the subject, object, and relation components of a relationship. By sequentially inputting these questions to the model, with supporting textual and visual memories guiding the process, ChainMPQ reduces relation hallucinations and improves relational reasoning in LVLMs. Experiments on various LVLMs and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ChainMPQ, with ablation studies confirming the importance of its three core modules. This training-free method shows promise in enhancing the reliability of LVLMs in multimodal tasks.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance in multimodal tasks, hallucinations continue to hinder their reliability. Among the three categories of hallucinations, which include object, attribute, and relation, relation hallucinations account for the largest proportion but have received the least attention. To address this issue, we propose ChainMPQ (Multi-Perspective Questions guided Interleaved Chain of Image and Text), a training-free method that improves relational inference in LVLMs by utilizing accumulated textual and visual memories. ChainMPQ first extracts subject and object keywords from the question to enhance the corresponding image regions. It then constructs multi-perspective questions that focus on the three core components of a relationship: the subject, the object, and the relation that links them. These questions are sequentially input to the model, with textual and visual memories from earlier steps providing supporting context for subsequent ones, thereby forming an interleaved chain of images and text that guides progressive relational reasoning. Experiments on multiple LVLMs and benchmarks show that ChainMPQ substantially reduces relation hallucinations, while ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of its three core modules.

Summary:
MobilePicasso is a novel system designed for efficient high-resolution image editing on resource-constrained devices. It consists of three stages: conducting image editing at a standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, using latent projection for pixel space transformation, and upscaling the edited image latent to higher resolution with adaptive context-preserving tiling. A user study with 46 participants showed that MobilePicasso enhances image quality by 18-48% and reduces hallucinations by 14-51% compared to existing methods. It also achieves significant speed-ups, up to 55.8 times, and minimal runtime memory increase, just 9% over previous approaches. Surprisingly, MobilePicasso's on-device runtime outperforms a server-based high-resolution image editing model running on an A100 GPU. <div>

Abstract: High-resolution (4K) image-to-image synthesis has become increasingly important for mobile applications. Existing diffusion models for image editing face significant challenges, in terms of memory and image quality, when deployed on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present MobilePicasso, a novel system that enables efficient image editing at high resolutions, while minimising computational cost and memory usage. MobilePicasso comprises three stages: (i) performing image editing at a standard resolution with hallucination-aware loss, (ii) applying latent projection to overcome going to the pixel space, and (iii) upscaling the edited image latent to a higher resolution with adaptive context-preserving tiling. Our user study with 46 participants reveals that MobilePicasso not only improves image quality by 18-48% but reduces hallucinations by 14-51% over existing methods. MobilePicasso demonstrates significantly lower latency, e.g., up to 55.8$\times$ speed-up, yet with a small increase in runtime memory, e.g., a mere 9% increase over prior work. Surprisingly, the on-device runtime of MobilePicasso is observed to be faster than a server-based high-resolution image editing model running on an A100 GPU.

Summary: 
This thesis focuses on implementing an AI-based Gaze Tracking system using RGBD images and a Transformer module for feature fusion. A new dataset is created for training AI models as existing datasets lack depth information or suitable labels for Gaze Angle Estimation. The model architecture is based on a Generative Adversarial Network for removing depth map artifacts and extracting head pose features. Results show that using a Transformer module leads to a mean Euclidean error of 55.3mm on the ShanghaiTechGaze+ dataset, while using no pre-trained GAN module reduces the error to 30.1mm. Replacing the Transformer module with an MLP further improves the error to 26.9mm. Results are consistent across three datasets, with the model achieving a mean angular error of 3.59° on the ETH-XGaze dataset. The study provides insights into the effectiveness of different model configurations in estimating the gaze direction of individuals in real-time scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Subject of this thesis is the implementation of an AI-based Gaze Tracking system using RGBD images that contain both color (RGB) and depth (D) information. To fuse the features extracted from the images, a module based on the Transformer architecture is used. The combination of RGBD input images and Transformers was chosen because it has not yet been investigated. Furthermore, a new dataset is created for training the AI models as existing datasets either do not contain depth information or only contain labels for Gaze Point Estimation that are not suitable for the task of Gaze Angle Estimation. Various model configurations are trained, validated and evaluated on a total of three different datasets. The trained models are then to be used in a real-time pipeline to estimate the gaze direction and thus the gaze point of a person in front of a computer screen. The AI model architecture used in this thesis is based on an earlier work by Lian et al. It uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to simultaneously remove depth map artifacts and extract head pose features. Lian et al. achieve a mean Euclidean error of 38.7mm on their own dataset ShanghaiTechGaze+. In this thesis, a model architecture with a Transformer module for feature fusion achieves a mean Euclidean error of 55.3mm on the same dataset, but we show that using no pre-trained GAN module leads to a mean Euclidean error of 30.1mm. Replacing the Transformer module with a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) improves the error to 26.9mm. These results are coherent with the ones on the other two datasets. On the ETH-XGaze dataset, the model with Transformer module achieves a mean angular error of 3.59{\deg} and without Transformer module 3.26{\deg}, whereas the fundamentally different model architecture used by the dataset authors Zhang et al. achieves a mean angular error of 2.04{\deg}.

arXiv:2510.06299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forest structural complexity metrics integrate multiple canopy attributes into a single value that reflects habitat quality and ecosystem function. Spaceborne lidar from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) has enabled mapping of structural complexity in temperate and tropical forests, but its sparse sampling limits continuous high-resolution mapping. We present a scalable, deep learning framework fusing GEDI observations with multimodal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) datasets to produce global, high-resolution (25 m) wall-to-wall maps of forest structural complexity. Our adapted EfficientNetV2 architecture, trained on over 130 million GEDI footprints, achieves high performance (global R2 = 0.82) with fewer than 400,000 parameters, making it an accessible tool that enables researchers to process datasets at any scale without requiring specialized computing infrastructure. The model produces accurate predictions with calibrated uncertainty estimates across biomes and time periods, preserving fine-scale spatial patterns. It has been used to generate a global, multi-temporal dataset of forest structural complexity from 2015 to 2022. Through transfer learning, this framework can be extended to predict additional forest structural variables with minimal computational cost. This approach supports continuous, multi-temporal monitoring of global forest structural dynamics and provides tools for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem management efforts in a changing climate.

Summary: TransFIRA introduces a lightweight and annotation-free framework for face recognition in challenging environments. By defining recognizability through class-center similarity and angular separation, it provides a decision-boundary-aligned criterion for filtering and weighting. The framework utilizes a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy, achieving high verification accuracy and improved correlation with true recognizability. It extends beyond faces to include body recognition assessment and encoder-grounded explainability, showcasing how factors like degradations and subject-specific traits impact recognizability. TransFIRA delivers state-of-the-art results on face recognition and robust performance on body recognition, demonstrating its accuracy, interpretability, and extensibility across modalities. This geometry-driven framework significantly advances face image quality assessment in terms of accuracy, explainability, and scope.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Face recognition in unconstrained environments such as surveillance, video, and web imagery must contend with extreme variation in pose, blur, illumination, and occlusion, where conventional visual quality metrics fail to predict whether inputs are truly recognizable to the deployed encoder. Existing FIQA methods typically rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or computationally intensive generative pipelines, leaving their predictions detached from the encoder's decision geometry. We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer Learning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and annotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding space. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability via class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS), yielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering and weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that achieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly doubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels, heuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond faces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations and subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first recognizability-aware body recognition assessment. Experiments confirm state-of-the-art results on faces, strong performance on body recognition, and robustness under cross-dataset shifts. Together, these contributions establish TransFIRA as a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability assessment -- encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across modalities -- significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and scope.

<div> roadside traffic cameras, machine learning models, road surface conditions, convolutional neural networks, random forests

Summary:
The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) utilizes a network of roadside traffic cameras to monitor road conditions, a process that currently involves manual observation. To improve efficiency, machine learning models were trained on camera images and weather data to predict road surface conditions. The models, including convolutional neural networks and random forests, were trained on a dataset of ~22,000 labeled camera images representing six road surface conditions. The goal was to prioritize model generalizability to meet the needs of NYSDOT decision-makers. The weather-related road surface condition model achieved an accuracy of 81.5% on unseen cameras, demonstrating the potential for automated classification of road conditions to aid in operational decision-making. <div>

Abstract: The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) has a network of roadside traffic cameras that are used by both the NYSDOT and the public to observe road conditions. The NYSDOT evaluates road conditions by driving on roads and observing live cameras, tasks which are labor-intensive but necessary for making critical operational decisions during winter weather events. However, machine learning models can provide additional support for the NYSDOT by automatically classifying current road conditions across the state. In this study, convolutional neural networks and random forests are trained on camera images and weather data to predict road surface conditions. Models are trained on a hand-labeled dataset of ~22,000 camera images, each classified by human labelers into one of six road surface conditions: severe snow, snow, wet, dry, poor visibility, or obstructed. Model generalizability is prioritized to meet the operational needs of the NYSDOT decision makers, and the weather-related road surface condition model in this study achieves an accuracy of 81.5% on completely unseen cameras.

Summary:
The article introduces a patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) designed to enhance thermal images captured by low-cost cameras. These images often suffer from low resolution and fixed pattern noise. TDiff leverages local distortions by training on small thermal patches, enabling the restoration of full-resolution images through denoising and blending overlapping patches. This framework is the first to model a learned prior for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks. Experiments on denoising, super-resolution, and deblurring tasks demonstrate strong results on both simulated and real thermal data, showcasing TDiff as a comprehensive restoration pipeline. <div>

Abstract: Thermal images from low-cost cameras often suffer from low resolution, fixed pattern noise, and other localized degradations. Available datasets for thermal imaging are also limited in both size and diversity. To address these challenges, we propose a patch-based diffusion framework (TDiff) that leverages the local nature of these distortions by training on small thermal patches. In this approach, full-resolution images are restored by denoising overlapping patches and blending them using smooth spatial windowing. To our knowledge, this is the first patch-based diffusion framework that models a learned prior for thermal image restoration across multiple tasks. Experiments on denoising, super-resolution, and deblurring demonstrate strong results on both simulated and real thermal data, establishing our method as a unified restoration pipeline.

Abstract: We present SIGMA-GEN, a unified framework for multi-identity preserving image generation. Unlike prior approaches, SIGMA-GEN is the first to enable single-pass multi-subject identity-preserved generation guided by both structural and spatial constraints.

Summary: <br />
Superpixels have been used in image simplification to improve computational efficiency, but their irregular distribution can complicate deep learning. The new SIGRID data structure combines color and shape information of superpixels to reduce input dimensionality for segmentation tasks. Tested on four benchmark datasets with convolutional segmentation architectures, SIGRIDs outperform or match pixel-level representations while accelerating model training. This balance between accuracy and computational efficiency demonstrates the effectiveness of SIGRIDs. <div>

Abstract: Superpixels have long been used in image simplification to enable more efficient data processing and storage. However, despite their computational potential, their irregular spatial distribution has often forced deep learning approaches to rely on specialized training algorithms and architectures, undermining the original motivation for superpixelations. In this work, we introduce a new superpixel-based data structure, SIGRID (Superpixel-Integrated Grid), as an alternative to full-resolution images in segmentation tasks. By leveraging classical shape descriptors, SIGRID encodes both color and shape information of superpixels while substantially reducing input dimensionality. We evaluate SIGRIDs on four benchmark datasets using two popular convolutional segmentation architectures. Our results show that, despite compressing the original data, SIGRIDs not only match but in some cases surpass the performance of pixel-level representations, all while significantly accelerating model training. This demonstrates that SIGRIDs achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

<div> Keywords: Text2Interact, human-human interactions, spatiotemporal coupling, interaction data synthesizer, fine-grained modeling

Summary: 
The article introduces the Text2Interact framework for modeling realistic human-human interactions accurately aligned with text descriptions. It addresses the challenges of limited two-person training data and collapsed text-to-interaction modeling. The framework includes two key components: InterCompose, a scalable synthesis-by-composition pipeline that aligns interaction descriptions with single-person motion priors, and InterActor, a text-to-interaction model with word-level conditioning for fine-grained modeling. InterCompose uses a neural motion evaluator to filter weak samples, expanding interaction coverage without additional data capture. InterActor preserves token-level cues and incorporates an adaptive interaction loss to emphasize contextually relevant joint pairs for improved coupling and physical plausibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate increased motion diversity, fidelity, and generalization even in out-of-distribution scenarios, validated through user studies. Code and models will be released for reproducibility. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling human-human interactions from text remains challenging because it requires not only realistic individual dynamics but also precise, text-consistent spatiotemporal coupling between agents. Currently, progress is hindered by 1) limited two-person training data, inadequate to capture the diverse intricacies of two-person interactions; and 2) insufficiently fine-grained text-to-interaction modeling, where language conditioning collapses rich, structured prompts into a single sentence embedding. To address these limitations, we propose our Text2Interact framework, designed to generate realistic, text-aligned human-human interactions through a scalable high-fidelity interaction data synthesizer and an effective spatiotemporal coordination pipeline. First, we present InterCompose, a scalable synthesis-by-composition pipeline that aligns LLM-generated interaction descriptions with strong single-person motion priors. Given a prompt and a motion for an agent, InterCompose retrieves candidate single-person motions, trains a conditional reaction generator for another agent, and uses a neural motion evaluator to filter weak or misaligned samples-expanding interaction coverage without extra capture. Second, we propose InterActor, a text-to-interaction model with word-level conditioning that preserves token-level cues (initiation, response, contact ordering) and an adaptive interaction loss that emphasizes contextually relevant inter-person joint pairs, improving coupling and physical plausibility for fine-grained interaction modeling. Extensive experiments show consistent gains in motion diversity, fidelity, and generalization, including out-of-distribution scenarios and user studies. We will release code and models to facilitate reproducibility.

Summary: 
Efficient video-language understanding requires selecting a small set of frames that convey semantic and contextual information. KeyScore, a multimodal frame scoring framework, utilizes captions and visual context to estimate frame importance by considering semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual impact. STACFP generates diverse frame candidates for long videos. Together, these modules achieve significant frame reduction and outperform standard encoders on various datasets. Emphasizing multimodal alignment between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient video understanding without explicit summarization. By leveraging KeyScore and STACFP, accurate video analysis for retrieval, captioning, and video-language reasoning can be achieved, enhancing the overall efficiency of video processing tasks. <div>

Abstract: Efficient video-language understanding requires selecting a small set of frames that retain semantic and contextual information from long videos. We propose KeyScore, a multimodal frame scoring framework that jointly leverages captions and visual context to estimate frame-level importance. By combining semantic similarity, temporal diversity, and contextual drop impact, KeyScore identifies the most informative frames for downstream tasks such as retrieval, captioning, and video-language reasoning. To complement KeyScore, we introduce STACFP (Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Clustering for Frame Proposals), which generates compact and diverse frame candidates for long-form videos. Together, these modules achieve up to 99\% frame reduction compared to full-frame inference and substantially outperform standard 8-frame encoders on MSRVTT, MSVD, and DiDeMo. Our results demonstrate that emphasizing multimodal alignment between visual and textual signals enables scalable, efficient, and caption-grounded video understanding -- without explicit video summarization.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural models such as YOLO and HuBERT can be used to detect local properties such as objects ("car") and emotions ("angry") in individual frames of videos and audio clips respectively. The likelihood of these detections is indicated by scores in [0, 1]. Lifting these scores to temporal properties over sequences can be useful for several downstream applications such as query matching (e.g., "does the speaker eventually sound happy in this audio clip?"), and ranked retrieval (e.g., "retrieve top 5 videos with a 10 second scene where a car is detected until a pedestrian is detected"). In this work, we formalize this problem of assigning Scores for TempOral Properties (STOPs) over sequences, given potentially noisy score predictors for local properties. We then propose a scoring function called LogSTOP that can efficiently compute these scores for temporal properties represented in Linear Temporal Logic. Empirically, LogSTOP, with YOLO and HuBERT, outperforms Large Vision / Audio Language Models and other Temporal Logic-based baselines by at least 16% on query matching with temporal properties over objects-in-videos and emotions-in-speech respectively. Similarly, on ranked retrieval with temporal properties over objects and actions in videos, LogSTOP with Grounding DINO and SlowR50 reports at least a 19% and 16% increase in mean average precision and recall over zero-shot text-to-video retrieval baselines respectively.

<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces TEMDiff, a novel 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework for limited-angle electron tomography in Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Unlike traditional deep learning approaches, TEMDiff is trained on volumetric FIB-SEM data using a simulator to learn structural priors without requiring clean TEM ground truth. Operating directly on 3D volumes, TEMDiff enforces consistency across slices without additional regularization, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality on simulated datasets. The trained TEMDiff model also demonstrates strong generalization to real-world TEM tilts with different conditions, accurately recovering structures from narrow tilt ranges as small as 8 degrees with 2-degree increments, without the need for retraining or fine-tuning.

Abstract: Limited-angle electron tomography aims to reconstruct 3D shapes from 2D projections of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) within a restricted range and number of tilting angles, but it suffers from the missing-wedge problem that causes severe reconstruction artifacts. Deep learning approaches have shown promising results in alleviating these artifacts, yet they typically require large high-quality training datasets with known 3D ground truth which are difficult to obtain in electron microscopy. To address these challenges, we propose TEMDiff, a novel 3D diffusion-based iterative reconstruction framework. Our method is trained on readily available volumetric FIB-SEM data using a simulator that maps them to TEM tilt series, enabling the model to learn realistic structural priors without requiring clean TEM ground truth. By operating directly on 3D volumes, TEMDiff implicitly enforces consistency across slices without the need for additional regularization. On simulated electron tomography datasets with limited angular coverage, TEMDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstruction quality. We further demonstrate that a trained TEMDiff model generalizes well to real-world TEM tilts obtained under different conditions and can recover accurate structures from tilt ranges as narrow as 8 degrees, with 2-degree increments, without any retraining or fine-tuning.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces VUGEN, a framework for efficient and high-quality image generation that leverages Vision-Language Models' visual understanding priors. VUGEN transforms the VLM's high-dimensional native vision encoder latent space into a lower-dimensional distribution while preserving visual information. The model is trained to sample within this reduced latent space, aligning with its visual understanding capabilities. A pixel decoder then converts the generated latents back into the image space. The approach outperforms existing methods, with a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder yielding comparable or better results than complex latent diffusion decoders. Extensive experiments show that VUGEN improves DPG Bench and FID scores on the COCO dataset while maintaining the VLM's original understanding capabilities. <div>
arXiv:2510.06529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled unified understanding across text and images, yet equipping these models with robust image generation capabilities remains challenging. Existing approaches often rely on reconstruction-oriented autoencoders or complex bridging mechanisms, leading to misalignment between understanding and generation representations, or architectural complexity. In this work, we propose VUGEN, a novel framework that explicitly leverages VLM's pretrained visual understanding priors for efficient and high-quality image generation. Our approach first transforms the high-dimensional latent space of the VLM's native vision encoder into a lower-dimensional, tractable distribution that maximally preserves visual information. The VLM is then trained to sample within this reduced latent space, ensuring alignment with its visual understanding capabilities. Finally, a dedicated pixel decoder maps these generated latents back to the image space. We find that a VAE-free pixel diffusion decoder to be on par or better than commonly used complex latent diffusion decoders that internally rely on VAE latents. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VUGEN achieves superior image generation performance, improving DPG Bench from 71.17 to 74.32 and FID from 11.86 to 9.06 on COCO, while fully preserving the VLM's original understanding capabilities.

<div> interpretability, deep neural networks, cluster paths, decision processes, biases

Summary:
Cluster paths offer a method for interpreting the decision processes of deep neural networks by clustering activations at specific layers and representing inputs as sequences of cluster IDs. Four metrics are introduced to assess cluster paths: path complexity, weighted-path purity, decision-alignment faithfulness, and path agreement. In experiments on CIFAR-10 and CelebA datasets, cluster paths successfully identify shortcuts and maintain faithfulness and stability under perturbations. Extending to a Vision Transformer model pretrained on ImageNet, concept paths derived from prompting a language model are explored. Additionally, cluster paths prove to be effective as an out-of-distribution detector, flagging anomalous samples before generating predictions. The method uncovers visual concepts such as color palettes and textures across different network depths, demonstrating scalability to large vision models while providing concise and human-readable explanations. 

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While modern deep neural networks achieve impressive performance in vision tasks, they remain opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted trust, undetected biases and unexpected failures. We propose cluster paths, a post-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers and represents each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. To assess these cluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load), weighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness (predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a spurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts and collapse when the cue is removed. On a five-class CelebA hair-color task, they achieve 90% faithfulness and maintain 96% agreement under Gaussian noise without sacrificing accuracy. Scaling to a Vision Transformer pretrained on ImageNet, we extend cluster paths to concept paths derived from prompting a large language model on minimal path divergences. Finally, we show that cluster paths can serve as an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, reliably flagging anomalous samples before the model generates over-confident predictions. Cluster paths uncover visual concepts, such as color palettes, textures, or object contexts, at multiple network depths, demonstrating that cluster paths scale to large vision models while generating concise and human-readable explanations.

The core idea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components using the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB) to capture diverse relational patterns and feature interactions. The Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) then integrates these representations, using adaptive weighting and fusion to construct a comprehensive representation. Additionally, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) helps retain salient features, improving accuracy while reducing computational overhead.

Abstract: Existing deep learning approaches for image super-resolution, particularly those based on CNNs and attention mechanisms, often suffer from structural inflexibility. Although graph-based methods offer greater representational adaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational complexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the Heterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently leverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core idea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components. First, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates a diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single monolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by modeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a rich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the Subgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across these subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features, SAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures intricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is designed to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing accuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively balancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point clouds is limited by costly manual annotation. We propose a semi-automated, uncertainty-aware pipeline that integrates spherical projection, feature enrichment, ensemble learning, and targeted annotation to reduce labeling effort, while sustaining high accuracy. Our approach projects 3D points to a 2D spherical grid, enriches pixels with multi-source features, and trains an ensemble of segmentation networks to produce pseudo-labels and uncertainty maps, the latter guiding annotation of ambiguous regions. The 2D outputs are back-projected to 3D, yielding densely annotated point clouds supported by a three-tier visualization suite (2D feature maps, 3D colorized point clouds, and compact virtual spheres) for rapid triage and reviewer guidance. Using this pipeline, we build Mangrove3D, a semantic segmentation TLS dataset for mangrove forests. We further evaluate data efficiency and feature importance to address two key questions: (1) how much annotated data are needed and (2) which features matter most. Results show that performance saturates after ~12 annotated scans, geometric features contribute the most, and compact nine-channel stacks capture nearly all discriminative power, with the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) plateauing at around 0.76. Finally, we confirm the generalization of our feature-enrichment strategy through cross-dataset tests on ForestSemantic and Semantic3D.
  Our contributions include: (i) a robust, uncertainty-aware TLS annotation pipeline with visualization tools; (ii) the Mangrove3D dataset; and (iii) empirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance, thus enabling scalable, high-quality segmentation of TLS point clouds for ecological monitoring and beyond. The dataset and processing scripts are publicly available at https://fz-rit.github.io/through-the-lidars-eye/.

Summary:
- Deep learning models trained on specific image distributions may fail when applied to new distributions with different artifacts, impacting classification accuracy.
- Domain adaptation using domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) can maintain classification performance on images with new artifacts without requiring labeled data for the new distribution.
- Baseline models trained only on clean images lack generalization to images with artifacts, while traditional augmentation approaches with other distortion types do not improve performance on unseen artifact domains.
- DANN approach successfully maintains high classification accuracy on images with ring artifacts, demonstrating the effectiveness of domain adaptation for artifact robustness.
- The domain-adapted model achieved comparable classification performance on ring artifact test data to models explicitly trained with labeled artifact images, and also showed unexpected generalization to uniform noise. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models which perform well on images from their training distribution can degrade substantially when applied to new distributions. If a CT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the model may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design features which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate artifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images from this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative, this study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that maintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without corresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in sinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against baseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT dataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean images fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional augmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen artifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high classification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact data during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for artifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification performance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained with labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to uniform noise. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation can effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring expensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for deployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge.

<div> Keywords: visual tokenization, autoregressive generation, MingTok, continuous latent space, vision-language tasks 

Summary: 
MingTok introduces a new approach to visual tokenization by employing a continuous latent space, aiming to improve semantic expressiveness and capability in vision-language tasks. The three-stage architecture of MingTok involves low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction, catering to both understanding and generation tasks. Ming-UniVision utilizes a unified continuous visual representation to support various vision-language tasks under a single autoregressive prediction paradigm. This approach allows for multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding, generation, and editing. Empirical results demonstrate that using a unified continuous visual representation yields state-of-the-art performance in both understanding and generation domains. The release of inference code and model weights aims to benefit the research community in advancing unified visual tokenization in the continuous domain. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual tokenization remains a core challenge in unifying visual understanding and generation within the autoregressive paradigm. Existing methods typically employ tokenizers in discrete latent spaces to align with the tokens from large language models, where the quantization errors can limit semantic expressiveness and degrade the capability of vision-language understanding. To address this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a continuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and understanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional features, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile these competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture involving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction. Built on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual representations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single autoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and generation as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly supports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding, generation and editing. Empirically, we find that using a unified continuous visual representation reconciles the competing requirements on the tokenizers by the understanding and generation tasks, thereby leading to state-of-the-art level performance across both domains. We hope our findings will facilitate unified visual tokenization in the continuous domain. Inference code and model weights are released to benefit community.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Deep learning advances have revolutionized automated digital pathology analysis. However, differences in staining protocols and imaging conditions can introduce significant color variability. In deep learning, such color inconsistency often reduces performance when deploying models on data acquired under different conditions from the training data, a challenge known as domain shift. Many existing methods attempt to address this problem via color normalization but suffer from several notable drawbacks such as introducing artifacts or requiring careful choice of a template image for stain mapping. To address these limitations, we propose a trainable color normalization model that can be integrated with any backbone network for downstream tasks such as object detection and classification. Based on the physics of the imaging process per the Beer-Lambert law, our model architecture is derived via algorithmic unrolling of a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model to extract stain-invariant structural information from the original pathology images, which serves as input for further processing. Experimentally, we evaluate the method on publicly available pathology datasets and an internally curated collection of malaria blood smears for cross-domain object detection and classification, where our method outperforms many state-of-the-art stain normalization methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xutianyue/BeerLaNet.

Summary:
The scarcity of well-annotated datasets in machine learning poses challenges for creating robust models. Synthetic data generated through simulations and generative models has emerged as a solution to enhance dataset diversity and improve model performance. However, evaluating the quality of synthetic data is crucial for model success. This paper introduces the Synthetic Dataset Quality Metric (SDQM), a metric designed to assess data quality for object detection tasks without the need for model training to converge. SDQM showed a strong correlation with mean Average Precision (mAP) scores of the YOLOv11 model, outperforming previous metrics. Additionally, SDQM provides actionable insights for improving dataset quality and minimizing the need for costly iterative training.

<br /><br />Summary: 
MRI is crucial for diagnosis but limited by long scan times. Fast MRI reconstruction with deep learning techniques is promising.

Experimental results confirm its superiority over supervised learning, even at high acceleration rates. <div>
arXiv:2510.06611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital clinical diagnostic tool, yet its widespread application is limited by prolonged scan times. Fast MRI reconstruction techniques effectively reduce acquisition duration by reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable progress in this field, with self-supervised and unsupervised learning approaches proving particularly valuable in scenarios where fully sampled data are difficult to obtain. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot self-supervised reconstruction framework named UnrollINR, which enables scan-specific MRI reconstruction without relying on external training data. The method adopts a physics-guided unrolled iterative reconstruction architecture and introduces Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as a regularization prior to effectively constrain the solution space. By combining a deep unrolled structure with the powerful implicit representation capability of INR, the model's interpretability and reconstruction performance are enhanced. Experimental results demonstrate that even at a high acceleration rate of 10, UnrollINR achieves superior reconstruction performance compared to the supervised learning method, validating the superiority of the proposed method.

<br />
Summary: <br />
Multilingual Experts (MuEx) is proposed to improve speech-driven talking face synthesis (TFS) across multiple languages. It utilizes a Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture that leverages phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries, bridging audio and video modalities. By extracting audio and video features as phonemes and visemes, linguistic differences and dataset bias are minimized. The Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align) ensures robust cross-modal correspondences between phonemes and visemes for effective audiovisual synchronization. A Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) containing 12 languages provides a diverse training and evaluation dataset. The results show that MuEx outperforms existing models in multilingual TFS, demonstrating superior performance across all languages in MTFB and achieving effective zero-shot generalization to untrained languages. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.06612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech-driven talking face synthesis (TFS) focuses on generating lifelike facial animations from audio input. Current TFS models perform well in English but unsatisfactorily in non-English languages, producing wrong mouth shapes and rigid facial expressions. The terrible performance is caused by the English-dominated training datasets and the lack of cross-language generalization abilities. Thus, we propose Multilingual Experts (MuEx), a novel framework featuring a Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture that employs phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries to bridge audio and video modalities, achieving lifelike multilingual TFS. To alleviate the influence of linguistic differences and dataset bias, we extract audio and video features as phonemes and visemes respectively, which are the basic units of speech sounds and mouth movements. To address audiovisual synchronization issues, we introduce the Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align), which establishes robust cross-modal correspondences between phonemes and visemes. In addition, we build a Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) comprising 12 diverse languages with 95.04 hours of high-quality videos for training and evaluating multilingual TFS performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MuEx achieves superior performance across all languages in MTFB and exhibits effective zero-shot generalization to unseen languages without additional training.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual object tracking in real-world scenarios presents numerous challenges including occlusion, interference from similar objects and complex backgrounds-all of which limit the effectiveness of RGB-based trackers. Multispectral imagery, which captures pixel-level spectral reflectance, enhances target discriminability. However, the availability of multispectral tracking datasets remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce MSITrack, the largest and most diverse multispectral single object tracking dataset to date. MSITrack offers the following key features: (i) More Challenging Attributes-including interference from similar objects and similarity in color and texture between targets and backgrounds in natural scenarios, along with a wide range of real-world tracking challenges; (ii) Richer and More Natural Scenes-spanning 55 object categories and 300 distinct natural scenes, MSITrack far exceeds the scope of existing benchmarks. Many of these scenes and categories are introduced to the multispectral tracking domain for the first time; (iii) Larger Scale-300 videos comprising over 129k frames of multispectral imagery. To ensure annotation precision, each frame has undergone meticulous processing, manual labeling and multi-stage verification. Extensive evaluations using representative trackers demonstrate that the multispectral data in MSITrack significantly improves performance over RGB-only baselines, highlighting its potential to drive future advancements in the field.

Summary: 
The article introduces StaR-KVQA, a method for Implicit-Knowledge Visual Question Answering (IK-KVQA) using multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Instead of relying on external retrieval, StaR-KVQA supervises structured reasoning traces to improve model interpretability and performance. By constructing path-grounded reasoning traces and fine-tuning with structured self-distillation, StaR-KVQA achieves higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA and demonstrates robust cross-domain generalization. This approach does not require external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases, making inference a single autoregressive pass. StaR-KVQA addresses the limitations of MLLMs in reasoning over implicit knowledge and produces transparent and verifiable explanations, leading to improved performance in IK-KVQA tasks. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.06638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires models to ground entities in images and reason over factual knowledge. We study its implicit-knowledge variant, IK-KVQA, where a multimodal large language model (MLLM) is the sole knowledge source, without external retrieval. Yet, MLLMs lack explicit reasoning supervision and produce inconsistent justifications, and generalize poorly after standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We present StaR-KVQA (Structured Reasoning Traces for IK-KVQA), which supervises structured traces - dual symbolic relation paths plus path-grounded natural-language explanations - so that reasoning becomes transparent and verifiable. With one open-source MLLM, StaR-KVQA constructs and selects path-grounded reasoning traces to form a trace-enriched dataset, then fine-tunes via structured self-distillation to align generation with supervision; no external retrievers, verifiers, or curated knowledge bases (KBs) are used, traces are built offline, and inference is a single autoregressive pass. Across benchmarks, StaR-KVQA improves both accuracy and interpretability, achieving up to +11.3% higher answer accuracy on OK-VQA over the strongest baseline while exhibiting robust cross-domain generalization.

Summary: <br />
Industrial surface defect detection is crucial for maintaining product quality, but faces challenges in detecting diverse defects. AutoNAD is introduced as an automated neural architecture design framework that addresses intraclass differences and interclass similarities in surface defect detection. By combining convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons, AutoNAD can effectively capture both local variations and long-range context. The framework includes a cross weight sharing strategy for efficient training and a searchable multi-level feature aggregation module to enhance multi-scale feature learning. AutoNAD also considers runtime efficiency by incorporating a latency-aware prior to select efficient architectures. The framework is validated on industrial defect datasets and applied in a defect imaging and detection platform, showcasing its effectiveness for real-world applications. <div>

Abstract: Industrial surface defect detection (SDD) is critical for ensuring product quality and manufacturing reliability. Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of surface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and interclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed models, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address both challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose AutoNAD, an automated neural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over convolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. This hybrid design enables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range semantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of manual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search space, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates supernet convergence and improves subnet performance. Additionally, a searchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) is integrated to enhance multi-scale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime efficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD incorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient architectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial defect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection platform. Code will be available at https://github.com/Yuxi104/AutoNAD.

Abstract: Recent advancements in instruction-based image editing and subject-driven generation have garnered significant attention, yet both tasks still face limitations in meeting practical user needs. Instruction-based editing relies solely on language instructions, which often fail to capture specific editing details, making reference images necessary. Meanwhile, subject-driven generation is limited to combining concrete objects or people, overlooking broader, abstract concepts. To address these challenges, we propose two novel tasks: multimodal instruction-based editing and generation. These tasks support both text and image instructions and extend the scope to include both concrete and abstract concepts, greatly enhancing their practical applications. We introduce DreamOmni2, tackling two primary challenges: data creation and model framework design. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of three steps: (1) using a feature mixing method to create extraction data for both abstract and concrete concepts, (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing training data using the editing and extraction models, and (3) further applying the extraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based editing. For the framework, to handle multi-image input, we propose an index encoding and position encoding shift scheme, which helps the model distinguish images and avoid pixel confusion. Additionally, we introduce joint training with the VLM and our generation/editing model to better process complex instructions. In addition, we have proposed comprehensive benchmarks for these two new tasks to drive their development. Experiments show that DreamOmni2 has achieved impressive results. Models and codes will be released.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation serves as a cornerstone of scene understanding in autonomous driving but continues to face significant challenges under complex conditions such as occlusion. Light field and LiDAR modalities provide complementary visual and spatial cues that are beneficial for robust perception; however, their effective integration is hindered by limited viewpoint diversity and inherent modality discrepancies. To address these challenges, the first multimodal semantic segmentation dataset integrating light field data and point cloud data is proposed. Based on this dataset, we proposed a multi-modal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation network(Mlpfseg), incorporating feature completion and depth perception to segment both camera images and LiDAR point clouds simultaneously. The feature completion module addresses the density mismatch between point clouds and image pixels by performing differential reconstruction of point-cloud feature maps, enhancing the fusion of these modalities. The depth perception module improves the segmentation of occluded objects by reinforcing attention scores for better occlusion awareness. Our method outperforms image-only segmentation by 1.71 Mean Intersection over Union(mIoU) and point cloud-only segmentation by 2.38 mIoU, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Abstract: Persistent dynamic scene modeling for tracking and novel-view synthesis remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing accurate deformations while maintaining computational efficiency. We propose SCas4D, a cascaded optimization framework that leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scenes. The key idea is that real-world deformations often exhibit hierarchical patterns, where groups of Gaussians share similar transformations. By progressively refining deformations from coarse part-level to fine point-level, SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time frame and produces results comparable to existing methods with only one-twentieth of the training iterations. The approach also demonstrates effectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view synthesis, and dense point tracking tasks.

<div> Evaluation Framework, Large Language Models, Historical OCR, Contamination Control, Model Selection

Summary:
The article introduces a new evaluation methodology for Large Language Model (LLM)-based historical Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in the digital humanities field. Traditional OCR metrics are insufficient for capturing temporal biases and period-specific errors, crucial for historical corpus creation. The proposed methodology includes novel metrics such as Historical Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR), as well as protocols for contamination control and stability testing. Evaluation of 12 multimodal LLMs on 18th-century Russian Civil font texts reveals that the Gemini and Qwen models outperform traditional OCR but exhibit over-historicization by inserting archaic characters from incorrect historical periods. Interestingly, post-OCR correction actually degrades performance rather than improving it. This methodology provides guidelines for digital humanities practitioners in selecting suitable models and assessing the quality of historical corpus digitization.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Digital humanities scholars increasingly use Large Language Models for historical document digitization, yet lack appropriate evaluation frameworks for LLM-based OCR. Traditional metrics fail to capture temporal biases and period-specific errors crucial for historical corpus creation. We present an evaluation methodology for LLM-based historical OCR, addressing contamination risks and systematic biases in diplomatic transcription. Using 18th-century Russian Civil font texts, we introduce novel metrics including Historical Character Preservation Rate (HCPR) and Archaic Insertion Rate (AIR), alongside protocols for contamination control and stability testing. We evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs, finding that Gemini and Qwen models outperform traditional OCR while exhibiting over-historicization: inserting archaic characters from incorrect historical periods. Post-OCR correction degrades rather than improves performance. Our methodology provides digital humanities practitioners with guidelines for model selection and quality assessment in historical corpus digitization.

<div> Frequency-Aware State-Space Module, Image deraining, Mamba-based models, Multi-Directional Perception Convolution, fine-grained details

Summary:
DeRainMamba is a novel approach for single image deraining that combines a Frequency-Aware State-Space Module (FASSM) and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution (MDPConv) to improve the visual quality of derained images and support downstream vision tasks. FASSM leverages Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from high-frequency image details, ensuring a balance between rain removal and detail preservation. MDPConv enhances local structures by capturing anisotropic gradient features and efficiently fusing convolution branches. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show that DeRainMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM metrics while requiring fewer parameters and lower computational costs. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of combining frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail enhancement within a state-space framework for effective single image deraining.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Image deraining is crucial for improving visual quality and supporting reliable downstream vision tasks. Although Mamba-based models provide efficient sequence modeling, their limited ability to capture fine-grained details and lack of frequency-domain awareness restrict further improvements. To address these issues, we propose DeRainMamba, which integrates a Frequency-Aware State-Space Module (FASSM) and Multi-Directional Perception Convolution (MDPConv). FASSM leverages Fourier transform to distinguish rain streaks from high-frequency image details, balancing rain removal and detail preservation. MDPConv further restores local structures by capturing anisotropic gradient features and efficiently fusing multiple convolution branches. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks demonstrate that DeRainMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR and SSIM, while requiring fewer parameters and lower computational costs. These results validate the effectiveness of combining frequency-domain modeling and spatial detail enhancement within a state-space framework for single image deraining.

Summary: 
OBS-Diff introduces a one-shot pruning framework for large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, overcoming the challenge of their high computational cost. The framework, based on Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) principles, supports various sparsity levels, including unstructured and semi-structured pruning. To align with the iterative nature of diffusion models, timestep-aware Hessian construction is used, giving more importance to earlier timesteps. A group-wise sequential pruning strategy is employed for efficient calibration. Experiments demonstrate that OBS-Diff achieves superior pruning results, offering accelerated inference without significant loss in visual quality.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, while powerful, suffer from prohibitive computational cost. Existing one-shot network pruning methods can hardly be directly applied to them due to the iterative denoising nature of diffusion models. To bridge the gap, this paper presents OBS-Diff, a novel one-shot pruning framework that enables accurate and training-free compression of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, (i) OBS-Diff revitalizes the classic Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS), adapting it to the complex architectures of modern diffusion models and supporting diverse pruning granularity, including unstructured, N:M semi-structured, and structured (MHA heads and FFN neurons) sparsity; (ii) To align the pruning criteria with the iterative dynamics of the diffusion process, by examining the problem from an error-accumulation perspective, we propose a novel timestep-aware Hessian construction that incorporates a logarithmic-decrease weighting scheme, assigning greater importance to earlier timesteps to mitigate potential error accumulation; (iii) Furthermore, a computationally efficient group-wise sequential pruning strategy is proposed to amortize the expensive calibration process. Extensive experiments show that OBS-Diff achieves state-of-the-art one-shot pruning for diffusion models, delivering inference acceleration with minimal degradation in visual quality.

<div> Keywords: supervised Gaussian denoisers, histogram matching, noise transformation, denoising performance, out-of-distribution noises

Summary:
The article introduces a novel approach to improve the generalization of supervised Gaussian denoisers when faced with out-of-distribution noise. By utilizing histogram matching techniques, arbitrary noise can be transformed to approximate a target Gaussian distribution with known intensity. A mutually reinforcing cycle is established between noise transformation and denoising, progressively refining the noise and enhancing the denoising performance. Specific noise complexities are addressed, including signal-dependent noise, channel-related noise, and spatial correlation. Through these transformations, a single Gaussian denoiser can effectively handle various out-of-distribution noises, both synthetic and real-world. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization and effectiveness of the proposed method. <div>

Abstract: Supervised Gaussian denoisers exhibit limited generalization when confronted with out-of-distribution noise, due to the diverse distributional characteristics of different noise types. To bridge this gap, we propose a histogram matching approach that transforms arbitrary noise towards a target Gaussian distribution with known intensity. Moreover, a mutually reinforcing cycle is established between noise transformation and subsequent denoising. This cycle progressively refines the noise to be converted, making it approximate the real noise, thereby enhancing the noise transformation effect and further improving the denoising performance. We tackle specific noise complexities: local histogram matching handles signal-dependent noise, intrapatch permutation processes channel-related noise, and frequency-domain histogram matching coupled with pixel-shuffle down-sampling breaks spatial correlation. By applying these transformations, a single Gaussian denoiser gains remarkable capability to handle various out-of-distribution noises, including synthetic noises such as Poisson, salt-and-pepper and repeating pattern noises, as well as complex real-world noises. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior generalization and effectiveness of our method.

<div> Keywords: high-resolution land-cover mapping, weak labels, Deep Multiple Instance Learning, Positive-Unlabeled Learning, multi-label classification

Summary:
This paper addresses the challenge of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery and weak low-resolution reference data. The proposed method leverages Deep Multiple Instance Learning to train pixel-level classifiers and predict low-resolution labels, allowing for implicit learning of high-resolution labels. By framing the Multiple Instance Learning problem in a multi-class and multi-label setting, the classifier is trained with a Positive-Unlabeled Learning strategy. Experimental results on the IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework compared to standard training strategies. The approach utilizes flexible pooling layers to connect pixel semantics in high-resolution imagery with low-resolution reference labels, enabling accurate land-cover mapping despite limited training data quality. The method proves particularly useful in scenarios where abundant weak labels are available, showcasing its potential for improving accuracy and efficiency in land-cover classification tasks.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.06769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantity and the quality of the training labels are central problems in high-resolution land-cover mapping with machine-learning-based solutions. In this context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on existing low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the problem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived land-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning (DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and predicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the actual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct supervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to link the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the low-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the former, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in the patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the presence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels can be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution labels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to standard training strategies.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Test-Time Rewarding for Vision Language Models (TTRV), a method that enhances vision language understanding without the need for labeled data. TTRV adapts the model on the fly at inference time in a test-time reinforcement learning framework. By rewarding the model based on output frequency and controlling output diversity, TTRV achieves significant improvements in object recognition and visual question answering tasks across 16 datasets. Notably, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B outperforms GPT-4o in image recognition and remains competitive in VQA. The method demonstrates the potential of test-time reinforcement learning for Vision Language Models, even in data-constrained scenarios, achieving notable improvements with minimal labeled data. <div>
arXiv:2510.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods for extracting reward signals in Reinforcement Learning typically rely on labeled data and dedicated training splits, a setup that contrasts with how humans learn directly from their environment. In this work, we propose TTRV to enhance vision language understanding by adapting the model on the fly at inference time, without the need for any labeled data. Concretely, we enhance the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by designing rewards based on the frequency of the base model's output, while inferring on each test sample multiple times. Further, we also propose to control the diversity of the model's output by simultaneously rewarding the model for obtaining low entropy of the output empirical distribution. Our approach delivers consistent gains across both object recognition and visual question answering (VQA), with improvements of up to 52.4% and 29.8%, respectively, and average boosts of 24.6% and 10.0% across 16 datasets.Remarkably, on image recognition, TTRV applied to InternVL 8B surpasses GPT-4o by an average of 2.3% over 8 benchmarks, while remaining highly competitive on VQA, demonstrating that test-time reinforcement learning can match or exceed the strongest proprietary models. Finally, we find many interesting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely data-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly chosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up to 5.5% in recognition tasks.

<div> Efficient, sample-free approach, Contextual cues, Extreme amodal object detection, Heatmap-based detector, Outperforming generative approaches 
<br />
Summary: 
This paper introduces a novel approach for extreme amodal detection, specifically focusing on the sub-problem of face detection. Unlike existing methods that rely on image sequences or generative models, the proposed method is designed for single-image tasks. By leveraging contextual cues within the image, a heatmap-based extreme amodal object detector is utilized to efficiently predict out-of-frame regions. The approach utilizes a selective coarse-to-fine decoder to infer the presence of unseen faces. The results of this method demonstrate superior performance compared to less efficient generative approaches, showcasing the effectiveness of the sample-free strategy in extreme amodal detection tasks. <div>
arXiv:2510.06791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme amodal detection is the task of inferring the 2D location of objects that are not fully visible in the input image but are visible within an expanded field-of-view. This differs from amodal detection, where the object is partially visible within the input image, but is occluded. In this paper, we consider the sub-problem of face detection, since this class provides motivating applications involving safety and privacy, but do not tailor our method specifically to this class. Existing approaches rely on image sequences so that missing detections may be interpolated from surrounding frames or make use of generative models to sample possible completions. In contrast, we consider the single-image task and propose a more efficient, sample-free approach that makes use of the contextual cues from the image to infer the presence of unseen faces. We design a heatmap-based extreme amodal object detector that addresses the problem of efficiently predicting a lot (the out-of-frame region) from a little (the image) with a selective coarse-to-fine decoder. Our method establishes strong results for this new task, even outperforming less efficient generative approaches.

<title>VA-Adapter: Adapting Ultrasound Foundation Model to Echocardiography Probe Guidance</title>

Abstract: Echocardiography is a critical tool for detecting heart diseases. Recently, ultrasound foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in cardiac ultrasound image analysis. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound images is a prerequisite for accurate diagnosis. Due to the exceptionally high operational difficulty of cardiac ultrasound, there is a shortage of highly skilled personnel, which hinders patients from receiving timely examination services. In this paper, we aim to adapt the medical knowledge learned by foundation models from vast datasets to the probe guidance task, which is designed to provide real-time operational recommendations for junior sonographers to acquire high-quality ultrasound images. Moreover, inspired by the practice where experts optimize action decisions based on past explorations, we meticulously design a parameter-efficient Vision-Action Adapter (VA-Adapter) to enable foundation model's image encoder to encode vision-action sequences, thereby enhancing guidance performance. With built-in sequential reasoning capabilities in a compact design, the VA-Adapter enables a pre-trained ultrasound foundation model to learn precise probe adjustment strategies by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the VA-Adapter can surpass strong probe guidance models. Our code will be released after acceptance.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.06820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal retrieval still leans on embedding-based models like CLIP for fast vector search over pre-computed image embeddings. Yet, unlike text retrieval, where joint-encoder rerankers are standard, comparable vision--language rerankers are largely absent. We find that seminal joint encoders such as BLIP are severely bottlenecked by an expensive visual feature-extraction stage, preventing practical deployment at scale. Motivated by this bottleneck, we introduce EDJE, an Efficient Discriminative Joint Encoder that precomputes vision tokens offline and compresses them via a lightweight attention-based adapter, so online inference runs only a compact joint encoder over a small set of visual tokens plus the text. EDJE preserves strong retrieval performance while drastically reducing storage and online compute, enabling high-throughput inference. Specifically, EDJE processes 50k image--text pairs/second while requiring 49kB of disk storage per image, matching prior art on Flickr (zero-shot) and COCO (fine-tuned) retrieval. The implementation and checkpoints will be made publicly available shortly.

arXiv:2510.06827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of text-to-image generation, diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools. Recently, studies on visual prompting, where images are used as prompts, have enabled more precise control over style and content. However, existing methods often suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements of the visual style prompt are transferred along with the intended style. To address this issue, we 1) extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) to utilize swapping self-attention and propose 2) negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to reduce the transfer of unwanted contents. NVQG employs negative score by intentionally simulating content leakage scenarios that swap queries instead of key and values of self-attention layers from visual style prompts. This simple yet effective method significantly reduces content leakage. Furthermore, we provide careful solutions for using a real image as visual style prompts. Through extensive evaluation across various styles and text prompts, our method demonstrates superiority over existing approaches, reflecting the style of the references, and ensuring that resulting images match the text prompts. Our code is available \href{https://github.com/naver-ai/StyleKeeper}{here}.

arXiv:2510.06829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line segment extraction is effective for capturing geometric features of human-made environments. Event-based cameras, which asynchronously respond to contrast changes along edges, enable efficient extraction by reducing redundant data. However, recent methods often rely on additional frame cameras or struggle with high event rates. This research addresses real-time line segment detection and tracking using only a modern, high-resolution (i.e., high event rate) event-based camera. Our lattice-allocated pipeline consists of (i) velocity-invariant event representation, (ii) line segment detection based on a fitting score, (iii) and line segment tracking by perturbating endpoints. Evaluation using ad-hoc recorded dataset and public datasets demonstrates real-time performance and higher accuracy compared to state-of-the-art event-only and event-frame hybrid baselines, enabling fully stand-alone event camera operation in real-world settings.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) quantifies human actions in videos, supporting applications in sports scoring, rehabilitation, and skill evaluation. A major challenge lies in the non-stationary nature of quality distributions in real-world scenarios, which limits the generalization ability of conventional methods. We introduce Continual AQA (CAQA), which equips AQA with Continual Learning (CL) capabilities to handle evolving distributions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Although parameter-efficient fine-tuning of pretrained models has shown promise in CL for image classification, we find it insufficient for CAQA. Our empirical and theoretical analyses reveal two insights: (i) Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FPFT) is necessary for effective representation learning; yet (ii) uncontrolled FPFT induces overfitting and feature manifold shift, thereby aggravating forgetting. To address this, we propose Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization (MAGR++), which couples backbone fine-tuning that stabilizes shallow layers while adapting deeper ones with a two-step feature rectification pipeline: a manifold projector to translate deviated historical features into the current representation space, and a graph regularizer to align local and global distributions. We construct four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets with tailored evaluation protocols and strong baselines, enabling systematic cross-dataset comparison. Extensive experiments show that MAGR++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average correlation gains of 3.6% offline and 12.2% online over the strongest baseline, confirming its robustness and effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZhouKanglei/MAGRPP.

Abstract: Generic Event Boundary Detection (GEBD) aims to interpret long-form videos through the lens of human perception. However, current GEBD methods require processing complete video frames to make predictions, unlike humans processing data online and in real-time. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task, Online Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD), aiming to detect boundaries of generic events immediately in streaming videos. This task faces unique challenges of identifying subtle, taxonomy-free event changes in real-time, without the access to future frames. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel On-GEBD framework, Estimator, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST) which explains how humans segment ongoing activity into events by leveraging the discrepancies between predicted and actual information. Our framework consists of two key components: the Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA), and the Online Boundary Discriminator (OBD). Specifically, the CEA generates a prediction of the future frame reflecting current event dynamics based solely on prior frames. Then, the OBD measures the prediction error and adaptively adjusts the threshold using statistical tests on past errors to capture diverse, subtle event transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that Estimator outperforms all baselines adapted from recent online video understanding models and achieves performance comparable to prior offline-GEBD methods on the Kinetics-GEBD and TAPOS datasets.

Abstract: With increasing processing power, deploying AI models for remote sensing directly onboard satellites is becoming feasible. However, new constraints arise, mainly when using raw, unprocessed sensor data instead of preprocessed ground-based products. While current solutions primarily rely on preprocessed sensor images, few approaches directly leverage raw data. This study investigates the effects of utilising raw data on deep learning models for object detection and classification tasks. We introduce a simulation workflow to generate raw-like products from high-resolution L1 imagery, enabling systemic evaluation. Two object detection models (YOLOv11s and YOLOX-S) are trained on both raw and L1 datasets, and their performance is compared using standard detection metrics and explainability tools. Results indicate that while both models perform similarly at low to medium confidence thresholds, the model trained on raw data struggles with object boundary identification at high confidence levels. It suggests that adapting AI architectures with improved contouring methods can enhance object detection on raw images, improving onboard AI for remote sensing.

Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile robots, requiring high accuracy and real-time processing, especially on resource-constrained embedded systems. Previous state-of-the-art methods often face a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Point-based and sparse convolution-based methods are accurate but slow due to the complexity of neighbor searching and 3D convolutions. Projection-based methods are faster but lose critical geometric information during the 2D projection. Additionally, many recent methods rely on test-time augmentation (TTA) to improve performance, which further slows the inference. Moreover, the pre-processing phase across all methods increases execution time and is demanding on embedded platforms. Therefore, we introduce HARP-NeXt, a high-speed and accurate LiDAR semantic segmentation network. We first propose a novel pre-processing methodology that significantly reduces computational overhead. Then, we design the Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block to efficiently capture representations without deep layer stacking per network stage. We also employ a multi-scale range-point fusion backbone that leverages information at multiple abstraction levels to preserve essential geometric details, thereby enhancing accuracy. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks show that HARP-NeXt achieves a superior speed-accuracy trade-off compared to all state-of-the-art methods, and, without relying on ensemble models or TTA, is comparable to the top-ranked PTv3, while running 24$\times$ faster.

Abstract: Lung infections, particularly pneumonia, pose serious health risks that can escalate rapidly, especially during pandemics. Accurate AI-based severity prediction from medical imaging is essential to support timely clinical decisions and optimize patient outcomes. In this work, we present a novel method applicable to both CT scans and chest X-rays for assessing lung infection severity. Our contributions are twofold: (i) QCross-Att-PVT, a Transformer-based architecture that integrates parallel encoders, a cross-gated attention mechanism, and a feature aggregator to capture rich multi-scale features; and (ii) Conditional Online TransMix, a custom data augmentation strategy designed to address dataset imbalance by generating mixed-label image patches during training. Evaluated on two benchmark datasets, RALO CXR and Per-COVID-19 CT, our method consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art deep learning models. The results emphasize the critical role of data augmentation and gated attention in improving both robustness and predictive accuracy. This approach offers a reliable, adaptable tool to support clinical diagnosis, disease monitoring, and personalized treatment planning.

Abstract: Change detection is a major task in remote sensing which consists in finding all the occurrences of changes in multi-temporal satellite or aerial images. The success of existing methods, and particularly deep learning ones, is tributary to the availability of hand-labeled training data that capture the acquisition conditions and the subjectivity of the user (oracle). In this paper, we devise a novel change detection algorithm, based on active learning. The main contribution of our work resides in a new model that measures how important is each unlabeled sample, and provides an oracle with only the most critical samples (also referred to as virtual exemplars) for further labeling. These exemplars are generated, using an invertible graph convnet, as the optimum of an adversarial loss that (i) measures representativity, diversity and ambiguity of the data, and thereby (ii) challenges (the most) the current change detection criteria, leading to a better re-estimate of these criteria in the subsequent iterations of active learning. Extensive experiments show the positive impact of our label-efficient learning model against comparative methods.

<title>IAR2: Improving Autoregressive Visual Generation with Semantic-Detail Associated Token Prediction</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06928</link>

Abstract: Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for visual content creation, but often overlook the intrinsic structural properties of visual data. Our prior work, IAR, initiated a direction to address this by reorganizing the visual codebook based on embedding similarity, thereby improving generation robustness. However, it is constrained by the rigidity of pre-trained codebooks and the inaccuracies of hard, uniform clustering. To overcome these limitations, we propose IAR2, an advanced autoregressive framework that enables a hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis process. At the core of IAR2 is a novel Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook, which decouples image representations into a semantic codebook for global semantic information and a detail codebook for fine-grained refinements. It expands the quantization capacity from a linear to a polynomial scale, significantly enhancing expressiveness. To accommodate this dual representation, we propose a Semantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction scheme coupled with a Local-Context Enhanced Autoregressive Head, which performs hierarchical prediction-first the semantic token, then the detail token-while leveraging a local context window to enhance spatial coherence. Furthermore, for conditional generation, we introduce a Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG mechanism that dynamically modulates the guidance scale for each token based on its relevance to the condition and its temporal position in the generation sequence, improving conditional alignment without sacrificing realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IAR2 sets a new state-of-the-art for autoregressive image generation, achieving a FID of 1.50 on ImageNet. Our model not only surpasses previous methods in performance but also demonstrates superior computational efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of our structured, coarse-to-fine generation strategy.

<title>OBJVanish: Physically Realizable Text-to-3D Adv. Generation of LiDAR-Invisible Objects</title>

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors are fundamental to autonomous driving, where failing to detect objects poses severe safety risks. Developing effective 3D adversarial attacks is essential for thoroughly testing these detection systems and exposing their vulnerabilities before real-world deployment. However, existing adversarial attacks that add optimized perturbations to 3D points have two critical limitations: they rarely cause complete object disappearance and prove difficult to implement in physical environments. We introduce the text-to-3D adversarial generation method, a novel approach enabling physically realizable attacks that can generate 3D models of objects truly invisible to LiDAR detectors and be easily realized in the real world. Specifically, we present the first empirical study that systematically investigates the factors influencing detection vulnerability by manipulating the topology, connectivity, and intensity of individual pedestrian 3D models and combining pedestrians with multiple objects within the CARLA simulation environment. Building on the insights, we propose the physically-informed text-to-3D adversarial generation (Phy3DAdvGen) that systematically optimizes text prompts by iteratively refining verbs, objects, and poses to produce LiDAR-invisible pedestrians. To ensure physical realizability, we construct a comprehensive object pool containing 13 3D models of real objects and constrain Phy3DAdvGen to generate 3D objects based on combinations of objects in this set. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach can generate 3D pedestrians that evade six state-of-the-art (SOTA) LiDAR 3D detectors in both CARLA simulation and physical environments, thereby highlighting vulnerabilities in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Text-to-3D modeling have shown significant potential for the creation of 3D content. However, due to the complex geometric shapes of objects in the natural world, generating 3D content remains a challenging task. Current methods either leverage 2D diffusion priors to recover 3D geometry, or train the model directly based on specific 3D representations. In this paper, we propose a novel method named DirectGaussian, which focuses on generating the surfaces of 3D objects represented by surfels. In DirectGaussian, we utilize conditional text generation models and the surface of a 3D object is rendered by 2D Gaussian splatting with multi-view normal and texture priors. For multi-view geometric consistency problems, DirectGaussian incorporates curvature constraints on the generated surface during optimization process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework is capable of achieving diverse and high-fidelity 3D content creation.

<title>Learning Global Representation from Queries for Vectorized HD Map Construction</title>

Abstract: The online construction of vectorized high-definition (HD) maps is a cornerstone of modern autonomous driving systems. State-of-the-art approaches, particularly those based on the DETR framework, formulate this as an instance detection problem. However, their reliance on independent, learnable object queries results in a predominantly local query perspective, neglecting the inherent global representation within HD maps. In this work, we propose \textbf{MapGR} (\textbf{G}lobal \textbf{R}epresentation learning for HD \textbf{Map} construction), an architecture designed to learn and utilize a global representations from queries. Our method introduces two synergistic modules: a Global Representation Learning (GRL) module, which encourages the distribution of all queries to better align with the global map through a carefully designed holistic segmentation task, and a Global Representation Guidance (GRG) module, which endows each individual query with explicit, global-level contextual information to facilitate its optimization. Evaluations on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets validate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to leading baselines.

<title>Addressing the ID-Matching Challenge in Long Video Captioning</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.06973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating captions for long and complex videos is both critical and challenging, with significant implications for the growing fields of text-to-video generation and multi-modal understanding. One key challenge in long video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear in different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior works have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer from limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits their overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we build upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the inherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the ID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new benchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using this benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights that the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1) enhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of information of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a novel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning Effectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption quality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision of ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15% to 80% compared to baseline. RICE makes it possible to continuously track different individuals in the captions of long videos.

<title>No MoCap Needed: Post-Training Motion Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning using Only Textual Prompts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.06988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced human motion generation, producing realistic and diverse animations from textual prompts. However, adapting these models to unseen actions or styles typically requires additional motion capture data and full retraining, which is costly and difficult to scale. We propose a post-training framework based on Reinforcement Learning that fine-tunes pretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, without requiring any motion ground truth. Our approach employs a pretrained text-motion retrieval network as a reward signal and optimizes the diffusion policy with Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization, effectively shifting the model's generative distribution toward the target domain without relying on paired motion data. We evaluate our method on cross-dataset adaptation and leave-one-out motion experiments using the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets across both latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures. Results from quantitative metrics and user studies show that our approach consistently improves the quality and diversity of generated motions, while preserving performance on the original distribution. Our approach is a flexible, data-efficient, and privacy-preserving solution for motion adaptation.

Abstract: The temporal consistency of yearly land-cover maps is of great importance to model the evolution and change of the land cover over the years. In this paper, we focus the attention on a novel approach to classification of yearly satellite image time series (SITS) that combines deep learning with Bayesian modelling, using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) integrated with Transformer Encoder (TE) based DNNs. The proposed approach aims to capture both i) intricate temporal correlations in yearly SITS and ii) specific patterns in multiyear crop type sequences. It leverages the cascade classification of an HMM layer built on top of the TE, discerning consistent yearly crop-type sequences. Validation on a multiyear crop type classification dataset spanning 47 crop types and six years of Sentinel-2 acquisitions demonstrates the importance of modelling temporal consistency in the predicted labels. HMMs enhance the overall performance and F1 scores, emphasising the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

<title>U-Bench: A Comprehensive Understanding of U-Net through 100-Variant Benchmarking</title>

arXiv:2510.07041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, U-Net has been the dominant architecture in medical image segmentation, leading to the development of thousands of U-shaped variants. Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely because of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of efficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we present U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that evaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates models along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot generalization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric, U-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering a deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis and Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale evaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and architectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we propose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most suitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We provide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to reproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary, U-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a foundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the next decade of U-Net-based segmentation models.

Abstract: A concept may reflect either a concrete or abstract idea. Given an input image, this paper seeks to retrieve other images that share its central concepts, capturing aspects of the underlying narrative. This goes beyond conventional retrieval or clustering methods, which emphasize visual or semantic similarity. We formally define the problem, outline key requirements, and introduce appropriate evaluation metrics. We propose a novel approach grounded in two key observations: (1) While each neighbor in the embedding space typically shares at least one concept with the query, not all neighbors necessarily share the same concept with one another. (2) Modeling this neighborhood with a bimodal Gaussian distribution uncovers meaningful structure that facilitates concept identification. Qualitative, quantitative, and human evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach. See the package on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/coret/

Abstract: Unsupervised object discovery, the task of identifying and localizing objects in images without human-annotated labels, remains a significant challenge and a growing focus in computer vision. In this work, we introduce a novel model, DADO (Depth-Attention self-supervised technique for Discovering unseen Objects), which combines an attention mechanism and a depth model to identify potential objects in images. To address challenges such as noisy attention maps or complex scenes with varying depth planes, DADO employs dynamic weighting to adaptively emphasize attention or depth features based on the global characteristics of each image. We evaluated DADO on standard benchmarks, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in object discovery accuracy and robustness without the need for fine-tuning.

arXiv:2510.07115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses explainable AI (XAI) through the lens of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) that do not require explicit concept annotations, relying instead on concepts extracted using CLIP in a zero-shot manner. We show that CLIP, which is central in these techniques, is prone to concept hallucination, incorrectly predicting the presence or absence of concepts within an image in scenarios used in numerous CBMs, hence undermining the faithfulness of explanations. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Concept Hallucination Inhibition via Localized Interpretability (CHILI), a technique that disentangles image embeddings and localizes pixels corresponding to target concepts. Furthermore, our approach supports the generation of saliency-based explanations that are more interpretable.

arXiv:2510.07119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monocular 3D foundation models offer an extensible solution for perception tasks, making them attractive for broader 3D vision applications. In this paper, we propose MoRe, a training-free Monocular Geometry Refinement method designed to improve cross-view consistency and achieve scale alignment. To induce inter-frame relationships, our method employs feature matching between frames to establish correspondences. Rather than applying simple least squares optimization on these matched points, we formulate a graph-based optimization framework that performs local planar approximation using the estimated 3D points and surface normals estimated by monocular foundation models. This formulation addresses the scale ambiguity inherent in monocular geometric priors while preserving the underlying 3D structure. We further demonstrate that MoRe not only enhances 3D reconstruction but also improves novel view synthesis, particularly in sparse view rendering scenarios.

<title>Validation of Various Normalization Methods for Brain Tumor Segmentation: Can Federated Learning Overcome This Heterogeneity?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has been increasingly applied in medical imaging, however, it requires large amounts of data, which raises many challenges related to data privacy, storage, and transfer. Federated learning (FL) is a training paradigm that overcomes these issues, though its effectiveness may be reduced when dealing with non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. This study simulates non-IID conditions by applying different MRI intensity normalization techniques to separate data subsets, reflecting a common cause of heterogeneity. These subsets are then used for training and testing models for brain tumor segmentation. The findings provide insights into the influence of the MRI intensity normalization methods on segmentation models, both training and inference. Notably, the FL methods demonstrated resilience to inconsistently normalized data across clients, achieving the 3D Dice score of 92%, which is comparable to a centralized model (trained using all data). These results indicate that FL is a solution to effectively train high-performing models without violating data privacy, a crucial concern in medical applications.

<title>Graph Conditioned Diffusion for Controllable Histopathology Image Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.07129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have set new standards in high-quality image synthesis. Yet, controlled generation remains challenging, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical imaging. Medical images feature inherent structure such as consistent spatial arrangement, shape or texture, all of which are critical for diagnosis. However, existing DPMs operate in noisy latent spaces that lack semantic structure and strong priors, making it difficult to ensure meaningful control over generated content. To address this, we propose graph-based object-level representations for Graph-Conditioned-Diffusion. Our approach generates graph nodes corresponding to each major structure in the image, encapsulating their individual features and relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer module and integrated into a diffusion model via the text-conditioning mechanism, enabling fine-grained control over generation. We evaluate this approach using a real-world histopathology use case, demonstrating that our generated data can reliably substitute for annotated patient data in downstream segmentation tasks. The code is available here.

Abstract: Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs) have shown remarkable potential thanks to large-scale pretraining, achieving strong zero-shot performance on various tasks. However, their ability to generalize in low-data regimes, such as few-shot learning, remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we present the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot adaptation methods on RSVLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across ten remote sensing scene classification datasets, applying five widely used few-shot adaptation strategies to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying backbones. Our findings reveal that models with similar zero-shot performance can exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some RSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. The variability of performance and the absence of a clear winner among existing methods highlight the need for the development of more robust methods for few-shot adaptation tailored to RS. To facilitate future research, we provide a reproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code to systematically evaluate RSVLMs under few-shot conditions.

<title>Are We Using the Right Benchmark: An Evaluation Framework for Visual Token Compression Methods</title>

Abstract: Recent endeavors to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have primarily focused on visual token compression. The effectiveness of these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on established benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the perception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate compression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token compression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals that simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive experiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are noisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to serve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual token compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an evaluation framework that incorporates a data filtering mechanism to denoise existing benchmarks, thereby enabling fairer and more accurate assessment of visual token compression methods. All data and code are available at https://github.com/Chenfei-Liao/VTC-Bench.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation, powered by large-scale datasets and diffusion techniques, have shown that video diffusion models can function as implicit 4D novel view synthesizers. Nevertheless, current methods primarily concentrate on redirecting camera trajectory within the front view while struggling to generate 360-degree viewpoint changes. In this paper, we focus on human-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework for creating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. To achieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset and incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use the camera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, which effectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. To maintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view human-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference video, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a robust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates the artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate our MV-Performer's state-of-the-art effectiveness and robustness, setting a strong model for human-centric 4D novel view synthesis.

<title>Resolution scaling governs DINOv3 transfer performance in chest radiograph classification</title>

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has advanced visual representation learning, but its value in chest radiography, a high-volume imaging modality with fine-grained findings, remains unclear. Meta's DINOv3 extends earlier SSL models through Gram-anchored self-distillation. Whether these design choices improve transfer learning for chest radiography has not been systematically tested. We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across seven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated: ViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and 1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The primary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2 achieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to 512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and ImageNet. In contrast, results in pediatric cohort showed no differences across initializations. Across all settings, ConvNeXt-B outperformed ViT-B/16. Models using frozen DINOv3-7B features underperformed relative to fully finetuned 86-89M-parameter backbones, highlighting the importance of domain adaptation. Scaling to 1024x1024 did not further improve accuracy. Resolution-related gains were most evident for boundary-dependent and small focal abnormalities. In chest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the benefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical upper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest performance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically, these findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for chest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting subtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care settings.

<title>EigenScore: OOD Detection using Covariance in Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the safe deployment of machine learning systems in safety-sensitive domains. Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models, capable of capturing complex data distributions through iterative denoising. Building on this progress, recent work has explored their potential for OOD detection. We propose EigenScore, a new OOD detection method that leverages the eigenvalue spectrum of the posterior covariance induced by a diffusion model. We argue that posterior covariance provides a consistent signal of distribution shift, leading to larger trace and leading eigenvalues on OOD inputs, yielding a clear spectral signature. We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior covariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for OOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace iteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward evaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance, with up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline. Notably, it remains robust in near-OOD settings such as CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100, where existing diffusion-based methods often fail.

<title>GenPilot: A Multi-Agent System for Test-Time Prompt Optimization in Image Generation</title>

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis has made remarkable progress, yet accurately interpreting complex and lengthy prompts remains challenging, often resulting in semantic inconsistencies and missing details. Existing solutions, such as fine-tuning, are model-specific and require training, while prior automatic prompt optimization (APO) approaches typically lack systematic error analysis and refinement strategies, resulting in limited reliability and effectiveness. Meanwhile, test-time scaling methods operate on fixed prompts and on noise or sample numbers, limiting their interpretability and adaptability. To solve these, we introduce a flexible and efficient test-time prompt optimization strategy that operates directly on the input text. We propose a plug-and-play multi-agent system called GenPilot, integrating error analysis, clustering-based adaptive exploration, fine-grained verification, and a memory module for iterative optimization. Our approach is model-agnostic, interpretable, and well-suited for handling long and complex prompts. Simultaneously, we summarize the common patterns of errors and the refinement strategy, offering more experience and encouraging further exploration. Experiments on DPG-bench and Geneval with improvements of up to 16.9% and 5.7% demonstrate the strong capability of our methods in enhancing the text and image consistency and structural coherence of generated images, revealing the effectiveness of our test-time prompt optimization strategy. The code is available at https://github.com/27yw/GenPilot.

Abstract: In this work, we present TalkCuts, a large-scale dataset designed to facilitate the study of multi-shot human speech video generation. Unlike existing datasets that focus on single-shot, static viewpoints, TalkCuts offers 164k clips totaling over 500 hours of high-quality human speech videos with diverse camera shots, including close-up, half-body, and full-body views. The dataset includes detailed textual descriptions, 2D keypoints and 3D SMPL-X motion annotations, covering over 10k identities, enabling multimodal learning and evaluation. As a first attempt to showcase the value of the dataset, we present Orator, an LLM-guided multi-modal generation framework as a simple baseline, where the language model functions as a multi-faceted director, orchestrating detailed specifications for camera transitions, speaker gesticulations, and vocal modulation. This architecture enables the synthesis of coherent long-form videos through our integrated multi-modal video generation module. Extensive experiments in both pose-guided and audio-driven settings show that training on TalkCuts significantly enhances the cinematographic coherence and visual appeal of generated multi-shot speech videos. We believe TalkCuts provides a strong foundation for future work in controllable, multi-shot speech video generation and broader multimodal learning.

<title>Evaluating Fundus-Specific Foundation Models for Diabetic Macular Edema Detection</title>

Abstract: Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) is a leading cause of vision loss among patients with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). While deep learning has shown promising results for automatically detecting this condition from fundus images, its application remains challenging due the limited availability of annotated data. Foundation Models (FM) have emerged as an alternative solution. However, it is unclear if they can cope with DME detection in particular. In this paper, we systematically compare different FM and standard transfer learning approaches for this task. Specifically, we compare the two most popular FM for retinal images--RETFound and FLAIR--and an EfficientNet-B0 backbone, across different training regimes and evaluation settings in IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2 and OCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images (OEFI). Results show that despite their scale, FM do not consistently outperform fine-tuned CNNs in this task. In particular, an EfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in terms of area under the ROC and precision/recall curves in most evaluation settings, with RETFound only showing promising results in OEFI. FLAIR, on the other hand, demonstrated competitive zero-shot performance, achieving notable AUC-PR scores when prompted appropriately. These findings reveal that FM might not be a good tool for fine-grained ophthalmic tasks such as DME detection even after fine-tuning, suggesting that lightweight CNNs remain strong baselines in data-scarce environments.

Abstract: Watermarking embeds imperceptible patterns into images for authenticity verification. However, existing methods often lack robustness against various transformations primarily including distortions, image regeneration, and adversarial perturbation, creating real-world challenges. In this work, we introduce SpecGuard, a novel watermarking approach for robust and invisible image watermarking. Unlike prior approaches, we embed the message inside hidden convolution layers by converting from the spatial domain to the frequency domain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposed by wavelet projection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Transform approximation to transform spatial data into the frequency domain efficiently. In the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverse attacks, including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions, ensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoder leverages Parseval's theorem to effectively learn and extract the watermark pattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. We evaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark's invisibility, capacity, and robustness. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed SpecGuard outperforms the state-of-the-art models. To ensure reproducibility, the full code is released on \href{https://github.com/inzamamulDU/SpecGuard_ICCV_2025}{\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{GitHub}}}.

Abstract: Video DiTs have advanced video generation, yet they still struggle to model multi-instance or subject-object interactions. This raises a key question: How do these models internally represent interactions? To answer this, we curate MATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance mask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis that formalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, via video-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens capture instances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-video attention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. We find both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers. Motivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularization that aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance mask tracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation. We further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-aware video generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity and semantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablations validate our design choices. Codes and weights will be released.

<title>WristWorld: Generating Wrist-Views via 4D World Models for Robotic Manipulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models as they capture fine-grained hand-object interactions that directly enhance manipulation performance. Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting in a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views. Existing world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view first frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views alone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with geometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme viewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first 4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views. WristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and incorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate geometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation, which employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent wrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid, Calvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with superior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the average task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the anchor-wrist view gap.

<title>Pixel-Perfect Depth with Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers</title>

Abstract: This paper presents Pixel-Perfect Depth, a monocular depth estimation model based on pixel-space diffusion generation that produces high-quality, flying-pixel-free point clouds from estimated depth maps. Current generative depth estimation models fine-tune Stable Diffusion and achieve impressive performance. However, they require a VAE to compress depth maps into latent space, which inevitably introduces \textit{flying pixels} at edges and details. Our model addresses this challenge by directly performing diffusion generation in the pixel space, avoiding VAE-induced artifacts. To overcome the high complexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two novel designs: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), which incorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT to prompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistency while enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design that progressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency and accuracy. Our model achieves the best performance among all published generative models across five benchmarks, and significantly outperforms all other models in edge-aware point cloud evaluation.

Abstract: Quantum-enhanced Computer Vision (QeCV) is a new research field at the intersection of computer vision, optimisation theory, machine learning and quantum computing. It has high potential to transform how visual signals are processed and interpreted with the help of quantum computing that leverages quantum-mechanical effects in computations inaccessible to classical (i.e. non-quantum) computers. In scenarios where existing non-quantum methods cannot find a solution in a reasonable time or compute only approximate solutions, quantum computers can provide, among others, advantages in terms of better time scalability for multiple problem classes. Parametrised quantum circuits can also become, in the long term, a considerable alternative to classical neural networks in computer vision. However, specialised and fundamentally new algorithms must be developed to enable compatibility with quantum hardware and unveil the potential of quantum computational paradigms in computer vision. This survey contributes to the existing literature on QeCV with a holistic review of this research field. It is designed as a quantum computing reference for the computer vision community, targeting computer vision students, scientists and readers with related backgrounds who want to familiarise themselves with QeCV. We provide a comprehensive introduction to QeCV, its specifics, and methodologies for formulations compatible with quantum hardware and QeCV methods, leveraging two main quantum computational paradigms, i.e. gate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing. We elaborate on the operational principles of quantum computers and the available tools to access, program and simulate them in the context of QeCV. Finally, we review existing quantum computing tools and learning materials and discuss aspects related to publishing and reviewing QeCV papers, open challenges and potential social implications.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the object referred to by the query sentence in the video. Most existing methods require end-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which could be computation-consuming and less scalable. In this work, we rethink the RVOS problem and aim to investigate the key to this task. Based on existing foundation segmentation models, we decompose the RVOS task into referring, video, and segmentation factors, and propose a Temporal Prompt Generation and Selection (Tenet) framework to address the referring and video factors while leaving the segmentation problem to foundation models. To efficiently adapt image-based foundation segmentation models to referring video object segmentation, we leverage off-the-shelf object detectors and trackers to produce temporal prompts associated with the referring sentence. While high-quality temporal prompts could be produced, they can not be easily identified from confidence scores. To tackle this issue, we propose Prompt Preference Learning to evaluate the quality of the produced temporal prompts. By taking such prompts to instruct image-based foundation segmentation models, we would be able to produce high-quality masks for the referred object, enabling efficient model adaptation to referring video object segmentation. Experiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tenet framework.

Our approach integrates multimodal representations from large language models, video encoders, audio models, and vision-language models, combining both off-the-shelf and fine-tuned variants. To improve performance, we enhanced textual inputs with detailed transcripts and summaries, and we explored stimulus-tuning and fine-tuning strategies for language and vision models. Predictions from individual models were combined using stacked regression, yielding solid results. Our submission, under the team name Seinfeld, ranked 10th. We make all code and resources publicly available, contributing to ongoing efforts in developing multimodal encoding models for brain activity.

Abstract: Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) is a primary cause of drug-resistant epilepsy and is difficult to detect in brain {magnetic resonance imaging} (MRI) due to the subtle and small-scale nature of its lesions. Accurate segmentation of FCD regions in 3D multimodal brain MRI images is essential for effective surgical planning and treatment. However, this task remains highly challenging due to the limited availability of annotated FCD datasets, the extremely small size and weak contrast of FCD lesions, the complexity of handling 3D multimodal inputs, and the need for output smoothness and anatomical consistency, which is often not addressed by standard voxel-wise loss functions. This paper presents a new framework for segmenting FCD regions in 3D brain MRI images. We adopt state-of-the-art transformer-enhanced encoder-decoder architecture and introduce a novel loss function combining Dice loss with an anisotropic {Total Variation} (TV) term. This integration encourages spatial smoothness and reduces false positive clusters without relying on post-processing. The framework is evaluated on a public FCD dataset with 85 epilepsy patients and demonstrates superior segmentation accuracy and consistency compared to standard loss formulations. The model with the proposed TV loss shows an 11.9\% improvement on the Dice coefficient and 13.3\% higher precision over the baseline model. Moreover, the number of false positive clusters is reduced by 61.6%

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and OpenCLIP, can encode and reflect stereotypical associations between medical professions and demographic attributes learned from web-scale data. We present an evaluation protocol for healthcare settings that quantifies associated biases and assesses their operational risk. Our methodology (i) defines a taxonomy spanning clinicians and allied healthcare roles (e.g., surgeon, cardiologist, dentist, nurse, pharmacist, technician), (ii) curates a profession-aware prompt suite to probe model behavior, and (iii) benchmarks demographic skew against a balanced face corpus. Empirically, we observe consistent demographic biases across multiple roles and vision models. Our work highlights the importance of bias identification in critical domains such as healthcare as AI-enabled hiring and workforce analytics can have downstream implications for equity, compliance, and patient trust.

Abstract: Incremental brain tumor segmentation is critical for models that must adapt to evolving clinical datasets without retraining on all prior data. However, catastrophic forgetting, where models lose previously acquired knowledge, remains a major obstacle. Recent incremental learning frameworks with knowledge distillation partially mitigate forgetting but rely heavily on generative replay or auxiliary storage. Meanwhile, diffusion models have proven effective for refining tumor segmentations, but have not been explored in incremental learning contexts. We propose Synthetic Error Replay Diffusion (SER-Diff), the first framework that unifies diffusion-based refinement with incremental learning. SER-Diff leverages a frozen teacher diffusion model to generate synthetic error maps from past tasks, which are replayed during training on new tasks. A dual-loss formulation combining Dice loss for new data and knowledge distillation loss for replayed errors ensures both adaptability and retention. Experiments on BraTS2020, BraTS2021, and BraTS2023 demonstrate that SER-Diff consistently outperforms prior methods. It achieves the highest Dice scores of 95.8\%, 94.9\%, and 94.6\%, along with the lowest HD95 values of 4.4 mm, 4.7 mm, and 4.9 mm, respectively. These results indicate that SER-Diff not only mitigates catastrophic forgetting but also delivers more accurate and anatomically coherent segmentations across evolving datasets.

Abstract: Our goal is to one day take a photo of a knot and have a phone automatically recognize it. In this expository work, we explain a strategy to approximate this goal, using a mixture of modern machine learning methods (in particular convolutional neural networks and transformers for image recognition) and traditional algorithms (to compute quantum invariants like the Jones polynomial). We present simple baselines that predict crossing number directly from images, showing that even lightweight CNN and transformer architectures can recover meaningful structural information. The longer-term aim is to combine these perception modules with symbolic reconstruction into planar diagram (PD) codes, enabling downstream invariant computation for robust knot classification. This two-stage approach highlights the complementarity between machine learning, which handles noisy visual data, and invariants, which enforce rigorous topological distinctions.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical tool in modern medical diagnostics, yet its prolonged acquisition time remains a critical limitation, especially in time-sensitive clinical scenarios. While undersampling strategies can accelerate image acquisition, they often result in image artifacts and degraded quality. Recent diffusion models have shown promise for reconstructing high-fidelity images from undersampled data by learning powerful image priors; however, most existing approaches either (i) rely on unsupervised score functions without paired supervision or (ii) apply data consistency only as a post-processing step. In this work, we introduce a conditional denoising diffusion framework with iterative data-consistency correction, which differs from prior methods by embedding the measurement model directly into every reverse diffusion step and training the model on paired undersampled-ground truth data. This hybrid design bridges generative flexibility with explicit enforcement of MRI physics. Experiments on the fastMRI dataset demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art deep learning and diffusion-based methods in SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS, with LPIPS capturing perceptual improvements more faithfully. These results demonstrate that integrating conditional supervision with iterative consistency updates yields substantial improvements in both pixel-level fidelity and perceptual realism, establishing a principled and practical advance toward robust, accelerated MRI reconstruction.

Abstract: Safe navigation in uncertain environments requires planning methods that integrate risk aversion with active perception. In this work, we present a unified framework that refines a coarse reference path by constructing tail-sensitive risk maps from Average Value-at-Risk statistics on an online-updated 3D Gaussian-splat Radiance Field. These maps enable the generation of locally safe and feasible trajectories. In parallel, we formulate Next-Best-View (NBV) selection as an optimization problem on the SE(3) pose manifold, where Riemannian gradient descent maximizes an expected information gain objective to reduce uncertainty most critical for imminent motion. Our approach advances the state-of-the-art by coupling risk-averse path refinement with NBV planning, while introducing scalable gradient decompositions that support efficient online updates in complex environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through extensive computational studies.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial robots are increasingly being deployed in real-world scenarios, where transparent obstacles present significant challenges to reliable navigation and mapping. These materials pose a unique problem for traditional perception systems because they lack discernible features and can cause conventional depth sensors to fail, leading to inaccurate maps and potential collisions. To ensure safe navigation, robots must be able to accurately detect and map these transparent obstacles. Existing methods often rely on large, expensive sensors or algorithms that impose high computational burdens, making them unsuitable for low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) robots. In this work, we propose a novel and computationally efficient framework for detecting and mapping transparent obstacles onboard a sub-300g quadrotor. Our method fuses data from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera and an ultrasonic sensor with a custom, lightweight 2D convolution model. This specialized approach accurately detects specular reflections and propagates their depth into corresponding empty regions of the depth map, effectively rendering transparent obstacles visible. The entire pipeline operates in real-time, utilizing only a small fraction of a CPU core on an embedded processor. We validate our system through a series of experiments in both controlled and real-world environments, demonstrating the utility of our method through experiments where the robot maps indoor environments containing glass. Our work is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind to demonstrate a real-time, onboard transparent obstacle mapping system on a low-SWaP quadrotor using only the CPU.

Abstract: Aortic aneurysm disease ranks consistently in the top 20 causes of death in the U.S. population. Thoracic aortic aneurysm is manifested as an abnormal bulging of thoracic aortic wall and it is a leading cause of death in adults. From the perspective of biomechanics, rupture occurs when the stress acting on the aortic wall exceeds the wall strength. Wall stress distribution can be obtained by computational biomechanical analyses, especially structural Finite Element Analysis. For risk assessment, probabilistic rupture risk of TAA can be calculated by comparing stress with material strength using a material failure model. Although these engineering tools are currently available for TAA rupture risk assessment on patient specific level, clinical adoption has been limited due to two major barriers: labor intensive 3D reconstruction current patient specific anatomical modeling still relies on manual segmentation, making it time consuming and difficult to scale to a large patient population, and computational burden traditional FEA simulations are resource intensive and incompatible with time sensitive clinical workflows. The second barrier was successfully overcome by our team through the development of the PyTorch FEA library and the FEA DNN integration framework. By incorporating the FEA functionalities within PyTorch FEA and applying the principle of static determinacy, we reduced the FEA based stress computation time to approximately three minutes per case. Moreover, by integrating DNN and FEA through the PyTorch FEA library, our approach further decreases the computation time to only a few seconds per case.

<title>Unsupervised Backdoor Detection and Mitigation for Spiking Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained increasing attention for their superior energy efficiency compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, their security aspects, particularly under backdoor attacks, have received limited attention. Existing defense methods developed for ANNs perform poorly or can be easily bypassed in SNNs due to their event-driven and temporal dependencies. This paper identifies the key blockers that hinder traditional backdoor defenses in SNNs and proposes an unsupervised post-training detection framework, Temporal Membrane Potential Backdoor Detection (TMPBD), to overcome these challenges. TMPBD leverages the maximum margin statistics of temporal membrane potential (TMP) in the final spiking layer to detect target labels without any attack knowledge or data access. We further introduce a robust mitigation mechanism, Neural Dendrites Suppression Backdoor Mitigation (NDSBM), which clamps dendritic connections between early convolutional layers to suppress malicious neurons while preserving benign behaviors, guided by TMP extracted from a small, clean, unlabeled dataset. Extensive experiments on multiple neuromorphic benchmarks and state-of-the-art input-aware dynamic trigger attacks demonstrate that TMPBD achieves 100% detection accuracy, while NDSBM reduces the attack success rate from 100% to 8.44%, and to 2.81% when combined with detection, without degrading clean accuracy.

<title>StruSR: Structure-Aware Symbolic Regression with Physics-Informed Taylor Guidance</title>

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to find interpretable analytical expressions by searching over mathematical formula spaces to capture underlying system behavior, particularly in scientific modeling governed by physical laws. However, traditional methods lack mechanisms for extracting structured physical priors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic expressions that reflect the system's global behavior. In this work, we propose a structure-aware symbolic regression framework, called StruSR, that leverages trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract locally structured physical priors from time series data. By performing local Taylor expansions on the outputs of the trained PINN, we obtain derivative-based structural information to guide symbolic expression evolution. To assess the importance of expression components, we introduce a masking-based attribution mechanism that quantifies each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical residual reduction. These sensitivity scores steer mutation and crossover operations within genetic programming, preserving substructures with high physical or structural significance while selectively modifying less informative components. A hybrid fitness function jointly minimizes physics residuals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with both the governing equations and the local analytical behavior encoded by the PINN. Experiments on benchmark PDE systems demonstrate that StruSR improves convergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability compared to conventional baselines, offering a principled paradigm for physics-grounded symbolic discovery.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in test-time scaling and finetuning of diffusion models, guidance in Auto-Regressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs) remains underexplored. We introduce an amortized framework that augments pretrained ARDMs with a lightweight controller network, trained offline by previewing future ARDM rollouts and learning stepwise controls that anticipate upcoming observations under a terminal cost objective. We evaluate this framework in the context of data assimilation (DA) for chaotic spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs), a setting where existing methods are often computationally prohibitive and prone to forecast drift under sparse observations. Our approach reduces DA inference to a single forward rollout with on-the-fly corrections, avoiding expensive adjoint computations and/or optimizations during inference. We demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in stability, accuracy, and physical fidelity across two canonical PDEs and six observation regimes. We will release code and checkpoints publicly.

<title>The False Promise of Zero-Shot Super-Resolution in Machine-Learned Operators</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06646</link>

arXiv:2510.06646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A core challenge in scientific machine learning, and scientific computing more generally, is modeling continuous phenomena which (in practice) are represented discretely. Machine-learned operators (MLOs) have been introduced as a means to achieve this modeling goal, as this class of architecture can perform inference at arbitrary resolution. In this work, we evaluate whether this architectural innovation is sufficient to perform "zero-shot super-resolution," namely to enable a model to serve inference on higher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We comprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution (i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution inference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency information; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically demonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner. Consequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at resolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they are brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we propose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution training protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust multi-resolution generalization.

<title>UniFField: A Generalizable Unified Neural Feature Field for Visual, Semantic, and Spatial Uncertainties in Any Scene</title>

Abstract: Comprehensive visual, geometric, and semantic understanding of a 3D scene is crucial for successful execution of robotic tasks, especially in unstructured and complex environments. Additionally, to make robust decisions, it is necessary for the robot to evaluate the reliability of perceived information. While recent advances in 3D neural feature fields have enabled robots to leverage features from pretrained foundation models for tasks such as language-guided manipulation and navigation, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (i) they are typically scene-specific, and (ii) they lack the ability to model uncertainty in their predictions. We present UniFField, a unified uncertainty-aware neural feature field that combines visual, semantic, and geometric features in a single generalizable representation while also predicting uncertainty in each modality. Our approach, which can be applied zero shot to any new environment, incrementally integrates RGB-D images into our voxel-based feature representation as the robot explores the scene, simultaneously updating uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our uncertainty estimations to accurately describe the model prediction errors in scene reconstruction and semantic feature prediction. Furthermore, we successfully leverage our feature predictions and their respective uncertainty for an active object search task using a mobile manipulator robot, demonstrating the capability for robust decision-making.

Abstract: We present a quantitative evaluation to understand the effect of zero-shot large-language model (LLMs) and prompting uses on chart reading tasks. We asked LLMs to answer 107 visualization questions to compare inference accuracies between the agentic GPT-5 and multimodal GPT-4V, for difficult image instances, where GPT-4V failed to produce correct answers. Our results show that model architecture dominates the inference accuracy: GPT5 largely improved accuracy, while prompt variants yielded only small effects.

Abstract: In this report, we compare the performance of our UltraGroth-based zero-knowledge machine learning framework Bionetta to other tools of similar purpose such as EZKL, Lagrange's deep-prove, or zkml. The results show a significant boost in the proving time for custom-crafted neural networks: they can be proven even on mobile devices, enabling numerous client-side proving applications. While our scheme increases the cost of one-time preprocessing steps, such as circuit compilation and generating trusted setup, our approach is, to the best of our knowledge, the only one that is deployable on the native EVM smart contracts without overwhelming proof size and verification overheads.

Abstract: Capturing and rendering three-dimensional (3D) objects in real time remain a significant challenge, yet hold substantial potential for applications in augmented reality, digital twin systems, remote collaboration and prototyping. We present an end-to-end pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) to enable rapid acquisition and interactive rendering of real-world objects using a mobile device, cloud processing and a local computer. Users scan an object with a smartphone video, upload it for automated 3D reconstruction, and visualize it interactively in Unity at an average of 150 frames per second (fps) on a laptop. The system integrates mobile capture, cloud-based 3D GS and Unity rendering to support real-time telepresence. Our experiments show that the pipeline processes scans in approximately 10 minutes on a graphics processing unit (GPU) achieving real-time rendering on the laptop.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Reasoning Models (MLRMs) demonstrate impressive cross-modal reasoning but often amplify safety risks under adversarial or unsafe prompts, a phenomenon we call the \textit{Reasoning Tax}. Existing defenses mainly act at the output level and do not constrain the reasoning process, leaving models exposed to implicit risks. In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a safety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly into multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I) QI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and reasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations undergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured reward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties for hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which reinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts safety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling scalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further demonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting dynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering. SaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and helpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\times$ larger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B. Remarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \num{6.47} and \num{16.76} points respectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any degradation in helpfulness performance.

Abstract: Constrained clustering integrates domain knowledge through pairwise constraints. However, existing deep constrained clustering (DCC) methods are either limited by anchors inherent in end-to-end modeling or struggle with learning discriminative Euclidean embedding, restricting their scalability and real-world applicability. To avoid their respective pitfalls, we propose a novel angular constraint embedding approach for DCC, termed SpherePair. Using the SpherePair loss with a geometric formulation, our method faithfully encodes pairwise constraints and leads to embeddings that are clustering-friendly in angular space, effectively separating representation learning from clustering. SpherePair preserves pairwise relations without conflict, removes the need to specify the exact number of clusters, generalizes to unseen data, enables rapid inference of the number of clusters, and is supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees. Comparative evaluations with state-of-the-art DCC methods on diverse benchmarks, along with empirical validation of theoretical insights, confirm its superior performance, scalability, and overall real-world effectiveness.

<title>High-Rate Mixout: Revisiting Mixout for Robust Domain Generalization</title>

Abstract: Ensembling fine-tuned models initialized from powerful pre-trained weights is a common strategy to improve robustness under distribution shifts, but it comes with substantial computational costs due to the need to train and store multiple models. Dropout offers a lightweight alternative by simulating ensembles through random neuron deactivation; however, when applied to pre-trained models, it tends to over-regularize and disrupt critical representations necessary for generalization. In this work, we investigate Mixout, a stochastic regularization technique that provides an alternative to Dropout for domain generalization. Rather than deactivating neurons, Mixout mitigates overfitting by probabilistically swapping a subset of fine-tuned weights with their pre-trained counterparts during training, thereby maintaining a balance between adaptation and retention of prior knowledge. Our study reveals that achieving strong performance with Mixout on domain generalization benchmarks requires a notably high masking probability of 0.9 for ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets. While this may seem like a simple adjustment, it yields two key advantages for domain generalization: (1) higher masking rates more strongly penalize deviations from the pre-trained parameters, promoting better generalization to unseen domains; and (2) high-rate masking substantially reduces computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by up to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%. Experiments across five domain generalization benchmarks, PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and DomainNet, using ResNet and ViT architectures, show that our approach, High-rate Mixout, achieves out-of-domain accuracy comparable to ensemble-based methods while significantly reducing training costs.

Abstract: Finetuning vision foundation models often improves in-domain accuracy but comes at the cost of robustness under distribution shift. We revisit Mixout, a stochastic regularizer that intermittently replaces finetuned weights with their pretrained reference, through the lens of a single-run, weight-sharing implicit ensemble. This perspective reveals three key levers that govern robustness: the \emph{masking anchor}, \emph{resampling frequency}, and \emph{mask sparsity}. Guided by this analysis, we introduce GMixout, which (i) replaces the fixed anchor with an exponential moving-average snapshot that adapts during training, and (ii) regulates masking period via an explicit resampling-frequency hyperparameter. Our sparse-kernel implementation updates only a small fraction of parameters with no inference-time overhead, enabling training on consumer-grade GPUs. Experiments on benchmarks covering covariate shift, corruption, and class imbalance, ImageNet / ImageNet-LT, DomainNet, iWildCam, and CIFAR100-C, GMixout consistently improves in-domain accuracy beyond zero-shot performance while surpassing both Model Soups and strong parameter-efficient finetuning baselines under distribution shift.

Abstract: Zero-shot quantization aims to learn a quantized model from a pre-trained full-precision model with no access to original real training data. The common idea in zero-shot quantization approaches is to generate synthetic data for quantizing the full-precision model. While it is well-known that deep neural networks with low sharpness have better generalization ability, none of the previous zero-shot quantization works considers the sharpness of the quantized model as a criterion for generating training data. This paper introduces a novel methodology that takes into account quantized model sharpness in synthetic data generation to enhance generalization. Specifically, we first demonstrate that sharpness minimization can be attained by maximizing gradient matching between the reconstruction loss gradients computed on synthetic and real validation data, under certain assumptions. We then circumvent the problem of the gradient matching without real validation set by approximating it with the gradient matching between each generated sample and its neighbors. Experimental evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art techniques in low-bit quantization settings.

Abstract: This work investigates how semantics influence localisation performance and robustness in a learned self-supervised, contrastive semantic localisation framework. After training a localisation network on both original and perturbed maps, we conduct a thorough post-hoc introspection analysis to probe whether the model filters environmental noise and prioritises distinctive landmarks over routine clutter. We validate various interpretability methods and present a comparative reliability analysis. Integrated gradients and Attention Weights consistently emerge as the most reliable probes of learned behaviour. A semantic class ablation further reveals an implicit weighting in which frequent objects are often down-weighted. Overall, the results indicate that the model learns noise-robust, semantically salient relations about place definition, thereby enabling explainable registration under challenging visual and structural variations.

Abstract: Amid growing efforts to leverage advances in large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for robotics, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently gained significant attention. By unifying vision, language, and action data at scale, which have traditionally been studied separately, VLA models aim to learn policies that generalise across diverse tasks, objects, embodiments, and environments. This generalisation capability is expected to enable robots to solve novel downstream tasks with minimal or no additional task-specific data, facilitating more flexible and scalable real-world deployment. Unlike previous surveys that focus narrowly on action representations or high-level model architectures, this work offers a comprehensive, full-stack review, integrating both software and hardware components of VLA systems. In particular, this paper provides a systematic review of VLAs, covering their strategy and architectural transition, architectures and building blocks, modality-specific processing techniques, and learning paradigms. In addition, to support the deployment of VLAs in real-world robotic applications, we also review commonly used robot platforms, data collection strategies, publicly available datasets, data augmentation methods, and evaluation benchmarks. Throughout this comprehensive survey, this paper aims to offer practical guidance for the robotics community in applying VLAs to real-world robotic systems.

Abstract: Embodied Visual Tracking (EVT) is a fundamental ability that underpins practical applications, such as companion robots, guidance robots and service assistants, where continuously following moving targets is essential. Recent advances have enabled language-guided tracking in complex and unstructured scenes. However, existing approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and effective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or in the presence of similar-looking distractors. To address these challenges, we present TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances embodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism and a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a Chain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative position and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action prediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update strategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal consistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive experiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings. On the challenging EVT-Bench DT split, TrackVLA++ surpasses the previous leading approach by 5.1 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, TrackVLA++ exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, enabling robust real-world tracking in dynamic and occluded scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in spatial reasoning, yet they remain fundamentally limited to qualitative precision and lack the computational precision required for real-world robotics. Current approaches fail to leverage metric cues from depth sensors and camera calibration, instead reducing geometric problems to pattern recognition tasks that cannot deliver the centimeter-level accuracy essential for robotic manipulation. We present TIGeR (Tool-Integrated Geometric Reasoning), a novel framework that transforms VLMs from perceptual estimators to geometric computers by enabling them to generate and execute precise geometric computations through external tools. Rather than attempting to internalize complex geometric operations within neural networks, TIGeR empowers models to recognize geometric reasoning requirements, synthesize appropriate computational code, and invoke specialized libraries for exact calculations. To support this paradigm, we introduce TIGeR-300K, a comprehensive tool-invocation-oriented dataset covering point transformations, pose estimation, trajectory generation, and spatial compatibility verification, complete with tool invocation sequences and intermediate computations. Through a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with our proposed hierarchical reward design, TIGeR achieves SOTA performance on geometric reasoning benchmarks while demonstrating centimeter-level precision in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: This extended abstract describes our solution for the Traffic4Cast Challenge 2019. The task requires modeling both fine-grained (pixel-level) and coarse (region-level) spatial structure while preserving temporal relationships across long sequences. Building on Conv-LSTM ideas, we introduce a tile-aware, cascaded-memory Conv-LSTM augmented with cross-frame additive attention and a memory-flexible training scheme: frames are sampled per spatial tile so the model learns tile-local dynamics and per-tile memory cells can be updated sparsely, paged, or compressed to scale to large maps. We provide a compact theoretical analysis (tight softmax/attention Lipschitz bound and a tiling error lower bound) explaining stability and the memory-accuracy tradeoffs, and empirically demonstrate improved scalability and competitive forecasting performance on large-scale traffic heatmaps.

Abstract: Advertisement video editing aims to automatically edit advertising videos into shorter videos while retaining coherent content and crucial information conveyed by advertisers. It mainly contains two stages: video segmentation and segment assemblage. The existing method performs well at video segmentation stages but suffers from the problems of dependencies on extra cumbersome models and poor performance at the segment assemblage stage. To address these problems, we propose M-SAN (Multi-modal Segment Assemblage Network) which can perform efficient and coherent segment assemblage task end-to-end. It utilizes multi-modal representation extracted from the segments and follows the Encoder-Decoder Ptr-Net framework with the Attention mechanism. Importance-coherence reward is designed for training M-SAN. We experiment on the Ads-1k dataset with 1000+ videos under rich ad scenarios collected from advertisers. To evaluate the methods, we propose a unified metric, Imp-Coh@Time, which comprehensively assesses the importance, coherence, and duration of the outputs at the same time. Experimental results show that our method achieves better performance than random selection and the previous method on the metric. Ablation experiments further verify that multi-modal representation and importance-coherence reward significantly improve the performance.

This paper proposes an effective model LLMVA-GEBC (Large Language Model with Video Adapter for Generic Event Boundary Captioning): (1) We utilize a pretrained LLM for generating human-like captions with high quality. (2) To adapt the model to the GEBC task, we take the video Q-former as an adapter and train it with the frozen visual feature extractors and LLM. Our proposed method achieved a 76.14 score on the test set and won the first place in the challenge. Our code is available at https://github.com/zjr2000/LLMVA-GEBC .

Abstract: This article introduces the Membership Inference Test (MINT), a novel approach that aims to empirically assess if given data was used during the training of AI/ML models. Specifically, we propose two MINT architectures designed to learn the distinct activation patterns that emerge when an Audited Model is exposed to data used during its training process. These architectures are based on Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The experimental framework focuses on the challenging task of Face Recognition, considering three state-of-the-art Face Recognition systems. Experiments are carried out using six publicly available databases, comprising over 22 million face images in total. Different experimental scenarios are considered depending on the context of the AI model to test. Our proposed MINT approach achieves promising results, with up to 90\% accuracy, indicating the potential to recognize if an AI model has been trained with specific data. The proposed MINT approach can serve to enforce privacy and fairness in several AI applications, e.g., revealing if sensitive or private data was used for training or tuning Large Language Models (LLMs).

<title>Unlocking Dataset Distillation with Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: Dataset distillation seeks to condense datasets into smaller but highly representative synthetic samples. While diffusion models now lead all generative benchmarks, current distillation methods avoid them and rely instead on GANs or autoencoders, or, at best, sampling from a fixed diffusion prior. This trend arises because naive backpropagation through the long denoising chain leads to vanishing gradients, which prevents effective synthetic sample optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce Latent Dataset Distillation with Diffusion Models (LD3M), the first method to learn gradient-based distilled latents and class embeddings end-to-end through a pre-trained latent diffusion model. A linearly decaying skip connection, injected from the initial noisy state into every reverse step, preserves the gradient signal across dozens of timesteps without requiring diffusion weight fine-tuning. Across multiple ImageNet subsets at 128x128 and 256x256, LD3M improves downstream accuracy by up to 4.8 percentage points (1 IPC) and 4.2 points (10 IPC) over the prior state-of-the-art. The code for LD3M is provided at https://github.com/Brian-Moser/prune_and_distill.

Abstract: The self-supervised contrastive learning strategy has attracted considerable attention due to its exceptional ability in representation learning. However, current contrastive learning tends to learn global coarse-grained representations of the image that benefit generic object recognition, whereas such coarse-grained features are insufficient for fine-grained visual recognition. In this paper, we incorporate subtle local fine-grained feature learning into global self-supervised contrastive learning through a pure self-supervised global-local fine-grained contrastive learning framework. Specifically, a novel pretext task called local discrimination (LoDisc) is proposed to explicitly supervise the self-supervised model's focus toward local pivotal regions, which are captured by a simple but effective location-wise mask sampling strategy. We show that the LoDisc pretext task can effectively enhance fine-grained clues in important local regions and that the global-local framework further refines the fine-grained feature representations of images. Extensive experimental results on different fine-grained object recognition tasks demonstrate that the proposed method can lead to a decent improvement in different evaluation settings. The proposed method is also effective for general object recognition tasks.

<title>Empowering LLMs with Pseudo-Untrimmed Videos for Audio-Visual Temporal Understanding</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language and multimodal domains. By fine-tuning multimodal LLMs with temporal annotations from well-annotated datasets, e.g., dense video captioning datasets, their temporal understanding capacity in video-language tasks can be obtained. However, there is a notable lack of untrimmed audio-visual video datasets with precise temporal annotations for events. This deficiency hinders LLMs from learning the alignment between time, audio-visual events, and text tokens, thus impairing their ability to temporally localize audio-visual events in videos. To address this gap, we introduce PU-VALOR, a comprehensive audio-visual dataset comprising over 114,000 pseudo-untrimmed videos with detailed temporal annotations. PU-VALOR is derived from the large-scale but coarse-annotated audio-visual dataset VALOR, through a subtle method involving event-based video clustering, random temporal scaling, and permutation. By fine-tuning a multimodal LLM on PU-VALOR, we developed AVicuna, a model capable of aligning audio-visual events with temporal intervals and corresponding text tokens. AVicuna excels in temporal localization and time-aware dialogue capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that AVicuna effectively handles temporal understanding in audio-visual videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-ended video QA, audio-visual QA, and audio-visual event dense localization tasks.

Abstract: Video summarization aims to create short, accurate, and cohesive summaries of longer videos. Despite the existence of various video summarization datasets, a notable limitation is their limited amount of source videos, which hampers the effective training of advanced large vision-language models (VLMs). Additionally, most existing datasets are created for video-to-video summarization, overlooking the contemporary need for multimodal video content summarization. Recent efforts have been made to expand from unimodal to multimodal video summarization, categorizing the task into three sub-tasks based on the summary's modality: video-to-video (V2V), video-to-text (V2T), and a combination of video and text summarization (V2VT). However, the textual summaries in previous multimodal datasets are inadequate. To address these issues, we introduce Instruct-V2Xum, a cross-modal video summarization dataset featuring 30,000 diverse videos sourced from YouTube, with lengths ranging from 40 to 940 seconds and an average summarization ratio of 16.39%. Each video summary in Instruct-V2Xum is paired with a textual summary that references specific frame indexes, facilitating the generation of aligned video and textual summaries. In addition, we propose a new video summarization framework named V2Xum-LLM. V2Xum-LLM, specifically V2Xum-LLaMA in this study, is the first framework that unifies different video summarization tasks into one large language model's (LLM) text decoder and achieves task-controllable video summarization with temporal prompts and task instructions. Experiments show that V2Xum-LLaMA outperforms strong baseline models on multiple video summarization tasks. Furthermore, we propose an enhanced evaluation metric for V2V and V2VT summarization tasks.

Abstract: Numerous applications require algorithms that can align partially overlapping point sets while maintaining invariance to geometric transformations (e.g., similarity, affine, rigid). This paper introduces a novel global optimization method for this task by minimizing the objective function of the Robust Point Matching (RPM) algorithm. We first reveal that the original RPM objective is a cubic polynomial. Through a concise variable substitution, we transform this objective into a quadratic function. By leveraging the convex envelope of bilinear monomials, we derive a tight lower bound for this quadratic function. This lower bound problem conveniently and efficiently decomposes into two parts: a standard linear assignment problem (solvable in polynomial time) and a low-dimensional convex quadratic program. Furthermore, we devise a specialized Branch-and-Bound (BnB) algorithm that branches exclusively on the transformation parameters, which significantly accelerates convergence by confining the search space. Experiments on 2D and 3D synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method, compared to state-of-the-art approaches, exhibits superior robustness to non-rigid deformations, positional noise, and outliers, particularly in scenarios where outliers are distinct from inliers.

Abstract: In the field of Image Quality Assessment (IQA), the adversarial robustness of the metrics poses a critical concern. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmarking study of various defense mechanisms in response to the rise in adversarial attacks on IQA. We systematically evaluate 25 defense strategies, including adversarial purification, adversarial training, and certified robustness methods. We applied 14 adversarial attack algorithms of various types in both non-adaptive and adaptive settings and tested these defenses against them. We analyze the differences between defenses and their applicability to IQA tasks, considering that they should preserve IQA scores and image quality. The proposed benchmark aims to guide future developments and accepts submissions of new methods, with the latest results available online: https://videoprocessing.ai/benchmarks/iqa-defenses.html.

<title>CaRDiff: Video Salient Object Ranking Chain of Thought Reasoning for Saliency Prediction with Diffusion</title>

Abstract: Video saliency prediction aims to identify the regions in a video that attract human attention and gaze, driven by bottom-up features from the video and top-down processes like memory and cognition. Among these top-down influences, language plays a crucial role in guiding attention by shaping how visual information is interpreted. Existing methods primarily focus on modeling perceptual information while neglecting the reasoning process facilitated by language, where ranking cues are crucial outcomes of this process and practical guidance for saliency prediction. In this paper, we propose CaRDiff (Caption, Rank, and generate with Diffusion), a framework that imitates the process by integrating a multimodal large language model (MLLM), a grounding module, and a diffusion model, to enhance video saliency prediction. Specifically, we introduce a novel prompting method VSOR-CoT (Video Salient Object Ranking Chain of Thought), which utilizes an MLLM with a grounding module to caption video content and infer salient objects along with their rankings and positions. This process derives ranking maps that can be sufficiently leveraged by the diffusion model to decode the saliency maps for the given video accurately. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of VSOR-CoT in improving the performance of video saliency prediction. The proposed CaRDiff performs better than state-of-the-art models on the MVS dataset and demonstrates cross-dataset capabilities on the DHF1k dataset through zero-shot evaluation.

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has enabled significant progress in multimodal understanding, expanding their capacity to analyze video content. However, existing evaluation benchmarks for MLLMs primarily focus on abstract video comprehension, lacking a detailed assessment of their ability to understand video compositions, the nuanced interpretation of how visual elements combine and interact within highly compiled video contexts. We introduce VidComposition, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the video composition understanding capabilities of MLLMs using carefully curated compiled videos and cinematic-level annotations. VidComposition includes 982 videos with 1706 multiple-choice questions, covering various compositional aspects such as camera movement, angle, shot size, narrative structure, character actions and emotions, etc. Our comprehensive evaluation of 33 open-source and proprietary MLLMs reveals a significant performance gap between human and model capabilities. This highlights the limitations of current MLLMs in understanding complex, compiled video compositions and offers insights into areas for further improvement.

Abstract: With the wide application of deep neural network models in various computer vision tasks, there has been a proliferation of adversarial example generation strategies aimed at deeply exploring model security. However, existing adversarial training defense models, which rely on single or limited types of attacks under a one-time learning process, struggle to adapt to the dynamic and evolving nature of attack methods. Therefore, to achieve defense performance improvements for models in long-term applications, we propose a novel Sustainable Self-Evolution Adversarial Training (SSEAT) framework. Specifically, we introduce a continual adversarial defense pipeline to realize learning from various kinds of adversarial examples across multiple stages. Additionally, to address the issue of model catastrophic forgetting caused by continual learning from ongoing novel attacks, we propose an adversarial data replay module to better select more diverse and key relearning data. Furthermore, we design a consistency regularization strategy to encourage current defense models to learn more from previously trained ones, guiding them to retain more past knowledge and maintain accuracy on clean samples. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed SSEAT defense method, which demonstrates superior defense performance and classification accuracy compared to competitors.Code is available at https://github.com/aup520/SSEAT

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) have achieved notable advancements, demonstrating the feasibility of developing an intelligent biomedical assistant. However, current biomedical MLLMs predominantly focus on image-level understanding and restrict interactions to textual commands, thus limiting their capability boundaries and the flexibility of usage. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end multimodal large language model for the biomedical domain, named MedPLIB, which possesses pixel-level understanding. Excitingly, it supports visual question answering (VQA), arbitrary pixel-level prompts (points, bounding boxes, and free-form shapes), and pixel-level grounding. We propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) multi-stage training strategy, which divides MoE into separate training phases for a visual-language expert model and a pixel-grounding expert model, followed by fine-tuning using MoE. This strategy effectively coordinates multitask learning while maintaining the computational cost at inference equivalent to that of a single expert model. To advance the research of biomedical MLLMs, we introduce the Medical Complex Vision Question Answering Dataset (MeCoVQA), which comprises an array of 8 modalities for complex medical imaging question answering and image region understanding. Experimental results indicate that MedPLIB has achieved state-of-the-art outcomes across multiple medical visual language tasks. More importantly, in zero-shot evaluations for the pixel grounding task, MedPLIB leads the best small and large models by margins of 19.7 and 15.6 respectively on the mDice metric. The codes, data, and model checkpoints will be made publicly available at https://github.com/ShawnHuang497/MedPLIB.

Abstract: Traditional Celluloid (Cel) Animation production pipeline encompasses multiple essential steps, including storyboarding, layout design, keyframe animation, inbetweening, and colorization, which demand substantial manual effort, technical expertise, and significant time investment. These challenges have historically impeded the efficiency and scalability of Cel-Animation production. The rise of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), encompassing large language models, multimodal models, and diffusion models, offers innovative solutions by automating tasks such as inbetween frame generation, colorization, and storyboard creation. This survey explores how GenAI integration is revolutionizing traditional animation workflows by lowering technical barriers, broadening accessibility for a wider range of creators through tools like AniDoc, ToonCrafter, and AniSora, and enabling artists to focus more on creative expression and artistic innovation. Despite its potential, challenges like visual consistency, stylistic coherence, and ethical considerations persist. Additionally, this paper explores future directions and advancements in AI-assisted animation.

Abstract: Concept erasure techniques have recently gained significant attention for their potential to remove unwanted concepts from text-to-image models. While these methods often demonstrate promising results in controlled settings, their robustness in real-world applications and suitability for deployment remain uncertain. In this work, we (1) identify a critical gap in evaluating sanitized models, particularly in assessing their performance across diverse concept dimensions, and (2) systematically analyze the failure modes of text-to-image models post-erasure. We focus on the unintended consequences of concept removal on non-target concepts across different levels of interconnected relationships including visually similar, binomial, and semantically related concepts. To address this, we introduce EraseBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating post-erasure performance. EraseBench includes over 100 curated concepts, targeted evaluation prompts, and a robust set of metrics to assess both effectiveness and side effects of erasure. Our findings reveal a phenomenon of concept entanglement, where erasure leads to unintended suppression of non-target concepts, causing spillover degradation that manifests as distortions and a decline in generation quality.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples that inputs with small, carefully crafted perturbations that cause misclassification, making adversarial attacks an essential tool for robustness evaluation. Existing black-box attacks fall into three categories: query-only, transfer-only, and query-and-transfer, and vary in perturbation pattern and optimization strategy. However, no prior method jointly achieves query-and-transfer guidance, pixel-wise sparsity, and training-free direct optimization, leaving a gap between black-box flexibility and white-box precision. We present GreedyPixel, a new attack framework that fills this gap by combining a surrogate-derived pixel priority map with greedy, per-pixel optimization refined by query feedback. This design reduces the exponential brute-force search space to a tractable linear procedure, guarantees monotonic loss decrease and convergence to a coordinate-wise optimum, and concentrates perturbations on robust, semantically meaningful pixels to improve perceptual quality. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet under both white-box and black-box settings demonstrate that GreedyPixel achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates and produces visually imperceptible perturbations. Our results show that GreedyPixel bridges the precision gap between white-box and black-box attacks and provides a practical framework for fine-grained robustness evaluation.

Abstract: Automated diagnostic systems (ADS) have shown significant potential in the early detection of polyps during endoscopic examinations, thereby reducing the incidence of colorectal cancer. However, due to high annotation costs and strict privacy concerns, acquiring high-quality endoscopic images poses a considerable challenge in the development of ADS. Despite recent advancements in generating synthetic images for dataset expansion, existing endoscopic image generation algorithms failed to accurately generate the details of polyp boundary regions and typically required medical priors to specify plausible locations and shapes of polyps, which limited the realism and diversity of the generated images. To address these limitations, we present Polyp-Gen, the first full-automatic diffusion-based endoscopic image generation framework. Specifically, we devise a spatial-aware diffusion training scheme with a lesion-guided loss to enhance the structural context of polyp boundary regions. Moreover, to capture medical priors for the localization of potential polyp areas, we introduce a hierarchical retrieval-based sampling strategy to match similar fine-grained spatial features. In this way, our Polyp-Gen can generate realistic and diverse endoscopic images for building reliable ADS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art generation quality, and the synthetic images can improve the downstream polyp detection task. Additionally, our Polyp-Gen has shown remarkable zero-shot generalizability on other datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/CUHK-AIM-Group/Polyp-Gen.

Abstract: Visual grounding (VG) aims to localize target objects in an image based on natural language descriptions. In this paper, we propose AerialVG, a new task focusing on visual grounding from aerial views. Compared to traditional VG, AerialVG poses new challenges, \emph{e.g.}, appearance-based grounding is insufficient to distinguish among multiple visually similar objects, and positional relations should be emphasized. Besides, existing VG models struggle when applied to aerial imagery, where high-resolution images cause significant difficulties. To address these challenges, we introduce the first AerialVG dataset, consisting of 5K real-world aerial images, 50K manually annotated descriptions, and 103K objects. Particularly, each annotation in AerialVG dataset contains multiple target objects annotated with relative spatial relations, requiring models to perform comprehensive spatial reasoning. Furthermore, we propose an innovative model especially for the AerialVG task, where a Hierarchical Cross-Attention is devised to focus on target regions, and a Relation-Aware Grounding module is designed to infer positional relations. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our dataset and method, highlighting the importance of spatial reasoning in aerial visual grounding. The code and dataset will be released.

Abstract: Automatic extraction of chemical structures from scientific literature plays a crucial role in accelerating research across fields ranging from drug discovery to materials science. Patent documents, in particular, contain molecular information in visual form, which is often inaccessible through traditional text-based searches. In this work, we introduce SubGrapher, a method for the visual fingerprinting of chemical structure images. Unlike conventional Optical Chemical Structure Recognition (OCSR) models that attempt to reconstruct full molecular graphs, SubGrapher focuses on extracting molecular fingerprints directly from chemical structure images. Using learning-based instance segmentation, SubGrapher identifies functional groups and carbon backbones, constructing a substructure-based fingerprint that enables chemical structure retrieval. Our approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art OCSR and fingerprinting methods, demonstrating superior retrieval performance and robustness across diverse molecular depictions. The dataset, models, and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Flow matching models have shown great potential in image generation tasks among probabilistic generative models. However, most flow matching models in the literature do not explicitly utilize the underlying clustering structure in the target data when learning the flow from a simple source distribution like the standard Gaussian. This leads to inefficient learning, especially for many high-dimensional real-world datasets, which often reside in a low-dimensional manifold. To this end, we present $\texttt{Latent-CFM}$, which provides efficient training strategies by conditioning on the features extracted from data using pretrained deep latent variable models. Through experiments on synthetic data from multi-modal distributions and widely used image benchmark datasets, we show that $\texttt{Latent-CFM}$ exhibits improved generation quality with significantly less training and computation than state-of-the-art flow matching models by adopting pretrained lightweight latent variable models. Beyond natural images, we consider generative modeling of spatial fields stemming from physical processes. Using a 2d Darcy flow dataset, we demonstrate that our approach generates more physically accurate samples than competing approaches. In addition, through latent space analysis, we demonstrate that our approach can be used for conditional image generation conditioned on latent features, which adds interpretability to the generation process.

Abstract: In this work, we present GPDiT, a Generative Pre-trained Autoregressive Diffusion Transformer that unifies the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive modeling for long-range video synthesis, within a continuous latent space. Instead of predicting discrete tokens, GPDiT autoregressively predicts future latent frames using a diffusion loss, enabling natural modeling of motion dynamics and semantic consistency across frames. This continuous autoregressive framework not only enhances generation quality but also endows the model with representation capabilities. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight causal attention variant and a parameter-free rotation-based time-conditioning mechanism, improving both the training and inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPDiT achieves strong performance in video generation quality, video representation ability, and few-shot learning tasks, highlighting its potential as an effective framework for video modeling in continuous space.

<title>PolyPose: Deformable 2D/3D Registration via Polyrigid Transformations</title>

Abstract: Determining the 3D pose of a patient from a limited set of 2D X-ray images is a critical task in interventional settings. While preoperative volumetric imaging (e.g., CT and MRI) provides precise 3D localization and visualization of anatomical targets, these modalities cannot be acquired during procedures, where fast 2D imaging (X-ray) is used instead. To integrate volumetric guidance into intraoperative procedures, we present PolyPose, a simple and robust method for deformable 2D/3D registration. PolyPose parameterizes complex 3D deformation fields as a composition of rigid transforms, leveraging the biological constraint that individual bones do not bend in typical motion. Unlike existing methods that either assume no inter-joint movement or fail outright in this under-determined setting, our polyrigid formulation enforces anatomically plausible priors that respect the piecewise-rigid nature of human movement. This approach eliminates the need for expensive deformation regularizers that require patient- and procedure-specific hyperparameter optimization. Across extensive experiments on diverse datasets from orthopedic surgery and radiotherapy, we show that this strong inductive bias enables PolyPose to successfully align the patient's preoperative volume to as few as two X-rays, thereby providing crucial 3D guidance in challenging sparse-view and limited-angle settings where current registration methods fail. Additional visualizations, tutorials, and code are available at https://polypose.csail.mit.edu.

Abstract: Understanding perspective is fundamental to human visual perception, yet the extent to which multimodal large language models (MLLMs) internalize perspective geometry remains unclear. We introduce MMPerspective, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs' understanding of perspective through 10 carefully crafted tasks across three complementary dimensions: Perspective Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness. Our benchmark comprises 2,711 real-world and synthetic image instances with 5,083 question-answer pairs that probe key capabilities, such as vanishing point perception and counting, perspective type reasoning, line relationship understanding in 3D space, invariance to perspective-preserving transformations, etc. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 43 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we uncover significant limitations: while models demonstrate competence on surface-level perceptual tasks, they struggle with compositional reasoning and maintaining spatial consistency under perturbations. Our analysis further reveals intriguing patterns between model architecture, scale, and perspective capabilities, highlighting both robustness bottlenecks and the benefits of chain-of-thought prompting. MMPerspective establishes a valuable testbed for diagnosing and advancing spatial understanding in vision-language systems. Resources available at: https://yunlong10.github.io/MMPerspective/

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) trained on internet-scale data achieve remarkable zero-shot detection performance on common objects like car, truck, and pedestrian. However, state-of-the-art models still struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution classes, tasks and imaging modalities not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply re-training VLMs on more visual data, we argue that one should align VLMs to new concepts with annotation instructions containing a few visual examples and rich textual descriptions. To this end, we introduce Roboflow100-VL, a large-scale collection of 100 multi-modal object detection datasets with diverse concepts not commonly found in VLM pre-training. We evaluate state-of-the-art models on our benchmark in zero-shot, few-shot, semi-supervised, and fully-supervised settings, allowing for comparison across data regimes. Notably, we find that VLMs like GroundingDINO and Qwen2.5-VL achieve less than 2% zero-shot accuracy on challenging medical imaging datasets within Roboflow100-VL, demonstrating the need for few-shot concept alignment. Lastly, we discuss our recent CVPR 2025 Foundational FSOD competition and share insights from the community. Notably, the winning team significantly outperforms our baseline by 17 mAP!

Abstract: Learning object-level, structured representations is widely regarded as a key to better generalization in vision and underpins the design of next-generation Pre-trained Vision Models (PVMs). Mainstream Object-Centric Learning (OCL) methods adopt Slot Attention or its variants to iteratively aggregate objects' super-pixels into a fixed set of query feature vectors, termed slots. However, their reliance on a static slot count leads to an object being represented as multiple parts when the number of objects varies. We introduce MetaSlot, a plug-and-play Slot Attention variant that adapts to variable object counts. MetaSlot (i) maintains a codebook that holds prototypes of objects in a dataset by vector-quantizing the resulting slot representations; (ii) removes duplicate slots from the traditionally aggregated slots by quantizing them with the codebook; and (iii) injects progressively weaker noise into the Slot Attention iterations to accelerate and stabilize the aggregation. MetaSlot is a general Slot Attention variant that can be seamlessly integrated into existing OCL architectures. Across multiple public datasets and tasks--including object discovery and recognition--models equipped with MetaSlot achieve significant performance gains and markedly interpretable slot representations, compared with existing Slot Attention variants.

Abstract: The integration of image and event streams offers a promising approach for achieving robust visual object tracking in complex environments. However, current fusion methods achieve high performance at the cost of significant computational overhead and struggle to efficiently extract the sparse, asynchronous information from event streams, failing to leverage the energy-efficient advantages of event-driven spiking paradigms. To address this challenge, we propose the first fully Spiking Frame-Event Tracking framework called SpikeFET. This network achieves synergistic integration of convolutional local feature extraction and Transformer-based global modeling within the spiking paradigm, effectively fusing frame and event data. To overcome the degradation of translation invariance caused by convolutional padding, we introduce a Random Patchwork Module (RPM) that eliminates positional bias through randomized spatial reorganization and learnable type encoding while preserving residual structures. Furthermore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Regularization (STR) strategy that overcomes similarity metric degradation from asymmetric features by enforcing spatio-temporal consistency among temporal template features in latent space. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior tracking accuracy over existing methods while significantly reducing power consumption, attaining an optimal balance between performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Predicting mortality-related outcomes from images offers the prospect of accessible, noninvasive, and scalable health screening. We present a method that leverages pretrained vision transformer foundation models to estimate remaining lifespan from facial and whole-body images, alongside robust uncertainty quantification. We show that predictive uncertainty varies systematically with the true remaining lifespan, and that this uncertainty can be effectively modeled by learning a Gaussian distribution for each sample. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art mean absolute error (MAE) of 7.41 years on an established dataset, and further achieves 4.91 and 4.99 years MAE on two new, higher-quality datasets curated and published in this work. Importantly, our models provide calibrated uncertainty estimates, as demonstrated by a bucketed expected calibration error of 0.82 years on the Faces Dataset. While not intended for clinical deployment, these results highlight the potential of extracting medically relevant signals from images. We make all code and datasets available to facilitate further research.

arXiv:2506.18369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to generate personalized image captions, even when trained on high-quality captions. In this work, we observe that such limitations persist in existing post-training-based MLLM personalization methods. Specifically, despite being post-tuned with large-scale caption data through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models frequently fail to produce faithful descriptions in real-world scenarios, such as multi-concept image captioning. However, acquiring large-scale, high-quality captions for such complex settings is both costly and difficult. To address the data-centric nature of SFT, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based approach to post-train MLLMs for personalized image captioning. Our method significantly enhances both visual recognition and personalized generation capabilities of MLLMs, and consistently outperforms existing SFT-based baselines, especially in the challenging multi-concept image captioning task.

Abstract: We introduce Warping-Alone Field Transforms (WAFT), a simple and effective method for optical flow. WAFT is similar to RAFT but replaces cost volume with high-resolution warping, achieving better accuracy with lower memory cost. This design challenges the conventional wisdom that constructing cost volumes is necessary for strong performance. WAFT is a simple and flexible meta-architecture with minimal inductive biases and reliance on custom designs. Compared with existing methods, WAFT ranks 1st on Spring, Sintel, and KITTI benchmarks, achieves the best zero-shot generalization on KITTI, while being up to 4.1x faster than methods with similar performance.

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents significant challenges in reconstructing high-quality novel views, as it often overfits to the widely-varying high-frequency (HF) details of the sparse training views. While frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has recently seen remarkable success, granting users with the ability to create high-quality images through the use of text. However, contemporary methods face challenges in capturing the precise semantics conveyed by complex multi-object prompts. Consequently, many works have sought to mitigate such semantic misalignments, typically via inference-time schemes that modify the attention layers of the denoising networks. However, prior work has mostly utilized coarse metrics, such as the cosine similarity between text and image CLIP embeddings, or human evaluations, which are challenging to conduct on a larger-scale. In this work, we perform a case study on colors -- a fundamental attribute commonly associated with objects in text prompts, which offer a rich test bed for rigorous evaluation. Our analysis reveals that pretrained models struggle to generate images that faithfully reflect multiple color attributes-far more so than with single-color prompts-and that neither inference-time techniques nor existing editing methods reliably resolve these semantic misalignments. Accordingly, we introduce a dedicated image editing technique, mitigating the issue of multi-object semantic alignment for prompts containing multiple colors. We demonstrate that our approach significantly boosts performance over a wide range of metrics, considering images generated by various text-to-image diffusion-based techniques.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enabled high-fidelity and semantically rich text-to-image generation; however, ensuring fairness and safety remains an open challenge. Existing methods typically improve fairness and safety at the expense of semantic fidelity and image quality. In this work, we propose RespoDiff, a novel framework for responsible text-to-image generation that incorporates a dual-module transformation on the intermediate bottleneck representations of diffusion models. Our approach introduces two distinct learnable modules: one focused on capturing and enforcing responsible concepts, such as fairness and safety, and the other dedicated to maintaining semantic alignment with neutral prompts. To facilitate the dual learning process, we introduce a novel score-matching objective that enables effective coordination between the modules. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity. Our approach improves responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across diverse, unseen prompts. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into large-scale models like SDXL, enhancing fairness and safety. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: This paper evaluates the current gaze estimation methods within an HRI context of a shared workspace scenario. We introduce a new, annotated dataset collected with the NICO robotic platform. We evaluate four state-of-the-art gaze estimation models. The evaluation shows that the angular errors are close to those reported on general-purpose benchmarks. However, when expressed in terms of distance in the shared workspace the best median error is 16.48 cm quantifying the practical limitations of current methods. We conclude by discussing these limitations and offering recommendations on how to best integrate gaze estimation as a modality in HRI systems.

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support, and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the 3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available at https://github.com/peacelwh/VT-FSL.

Abstract: We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS.

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper, we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment (PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences: 66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

Abstract: Meta-learning is an effective method to handle imbalanced and noisy-label learning, but it depends on a validation set containing randomly selected, manually labelled and balanced distributed samples. The random selection and manual labelling and balancing of this validation set is not only sub-optimal for meta-learning, but it also scales poorly with the number of classes. Hence, recent meta-learning papers have proposed ad-hoc heuristics to automatically build and label this validation set, but these heuristics are still sub-optimal for meta-learning. In this paper, we analyse the meta-learning algorithm and propose new criteria to characterise the utility of the validation set, based on: 1) the informativeness of the validation set; 2) the class distribution balance of the set; and 3) the correctness of the labels of the set. Furthermore, we propose a new imbalanced noisy-label meta-learning (INOLML) algorithm that automatically builds a validation set by maximising its utility using the criteria above. Our method shows significant improvements over previous meta-learning approaches and sets the new state-of-the-art on several benchmarks.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have drawn much attention for their high energy efficiency and recent advances in classification performance. However, unlike traditional deep learning, the robustness of SNNs to adversarial examples remains underexplored. This work advances the adversarial attack side of SNNs and makes three major contributions. First, we show that successful white-box attacks on SNNs strongly depend on the surrogate gradient estimation technique, even for adversarially trained models. Second, using the best single surrogate gradient estimator, we study the transferability of adversarial examples between SNNs and state-of-the-art architectures such as Vision Transformers (ViTs) and CNNs. Our analysis reveals two major gaps: no existing white-box attack leverages multiple surrogate estimators, and no single attack effectively fools both SNNs and non-SNN models simultaneously. Third, we propose the Mixed Dynamic Spiking Estimation (MDSE) attack, which dynamically combines multiple surrogate gradients to overcome these gaps. MDSE produces adversarial examples that fool both SNN and non-SNN models, achieving up to 91.4% higher effectiveness on SNN/ViT ensembles and a 3x boost on adversarially trained SNN ensembles over Auto-PGD. Experiments span three datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet) and nineteen classifiers, and we will release code and models upon publication.

Abstract: Data augmentation is one of the most effective techniques for regularizing deep learning models and improving their recognition performance in a variety of tasks and domains. However, this holds for standard in-domain settings, in which the training and test data follow the same distribution. For the out-of-domain case, where the test data follow a different and unknown distribution, the best recipe for data augmentation is unclear. In this paper, we show that for out-of-domain and domain generalization settings, data augmentation can provide a conspicuous and robust improvement in performance. To do that, we propose a simple training procedure: (i) use uniform sampling on standard data augmentation transformations; (ii) increase the strength transformations to account for the higher data variance expected when working out-of-domain, and (iii) devise a new reward function to reject extreme transformations that can harm the training. With this procedure, our data augmentation scheme achieves a level of accuracy that is comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods on benchmark domain generalization datasets.

The pipeline proceeds in three steps, first identifying the whole object to segment via automatic thresholding, then detecting a distinctive subset whose topology is known in advance, and finally deducing the various components of the segmentation. Unlike most prior TDA uses in medical image segmentation, which are typically embedded within deep networks, our approach is a standalone method tailored to MRI. A key ingredient is the localization of representative cycles from the persistence diagram, which enables interpretable mappings from topological features to anatomical components. In particular, the method offers the ability to perform segmentation without the need for large annotated datasets. Its modular design makes it adaptable to a wide range of data segmentation challenges. We validate the framework on three applications: glioblastoma segmentation in brain MRI, where a sphere is to be detected; myocardium in cardiac MRI, forming a cylinder; and cortical plate detection in fetal brain MRI, whose 2D slices are circles. We compare our method with established supervised and unsupervised baselines.

Abstract: The accurate and timely diagnosis of acute aortic syndromes (AAS) in patients presenting with acute chest pain remains a clinical challenge. Aortic CT angiography (CTA) is the imaging protocol of choice in patients with suspected AAS. However, due to economic and workflow constraints in China, the majority of suspected patients initially undergo non-contrast CT as the initial imaging testing, and CTA is reserved for those at higher risk. In this work, we present an artificial intelligence-based warning system, iAorta, using non-contrast CT for AAS identification in China, which demonstrates remarkably high accuracy and provides clinicians with interpretable warnings. iAorta was evaluated through a comprehensive step-wise study. In the multi-center retrospective study (n = 20,750), iAorta achieved a mean area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.958 (95% CI 0.950-0.967). In the large-scale real-world study (n = 137,525), iAorta demonstrated consistently high performance across various non-contrast CT protocols, achieving a sensitivity of 0.913-0.942 and a specificity of 0.991-0.993. In the prospective comparative study (n = 13,846), iAorta demonstrated the capability to significantly shorten the time to correct diagnostic pathway. For the prospective pilot deployment that we conducted, iAorta correctly identified 21 out of 22 patients with AAS among 15,584 consecutive patients presenting with acute chest pain and under non-contrast CT protocol in the emergency department (ED) and enabled the average diagnostic time of these 21 AAS positive patients to be 102.1 (75-133) mins. Last, the iAorta can help avoid delayed or missed diagnosis of AAS in settings where non-contrast CT remains the unavoidable the initial or only imaging test in resource-constrained regions and in patients who cannot or did not receive intravenous contrast.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) have significantly advanced tasks such as multimodal question answering by grounding responses in external text and images. This grounding improves factuality, reduces hallucination, and extends reasoning beyond parametric knowledge. However, this reliance on external knowledge poses a critical yet underexplored safety risk: knowledge poisoning attacks, where adversaries deliberately inject adversarial multimodal content into external knowledge bases to steer model toward generating incorrect or even harmful responses. To expose such vulnerabilities, we propose MM-PoisonRAG, the first framework to systematically design knowledge poisoning in multimodal RAG. We introduce two complementary attack strategies: Localized Poisoning Attack (LPA), which implants targeted multimodal misinformation to manipulate specific queries, and Globalized Poisoning Attack (GPA), which inserts a single adversarial knowledge to broadly disrupt reasoning and induce nonsensical responses across all queries. Comprehensive experiments across tasks, models, and access settings show that LPA achieves targeted manipulation with attack success rates of up to 56%, while GPA completely disrupts model generation to 0% accuracy with just a single adversarial knowledge injection. Our results reveal the fragility of multimodal RAG and highlight the urgent need for defenses against knowledge poisoning.

Abstract: Over the past decades, there has been an explosion in the amount of available Earth Observation (EO) data. The unprecedented coverage of the Earth's surface and atmosphere by satellite imagery has resulted in large volumes of data that must be transmitted to ground stations, stored in data centers, and distributed to end users. Modern Earth System Models (ESMs) face similar challenges, operating at high spatial and temporal resolutions, producing petabytes of data per simulated day. Data compression has gained relevance over the past decade, with neural compression (NC) emerging from deep learning and information theory, making EO data and ESM outputs ideal candidates due to their abundance of unlabeled data. In this review, we outline recent developments in NC applied to geospatial data. We introduce the fundamental concepts of NC including seminal works in its traditional applications to image and video compression domains with focus on lossy compression. We discuss the unique characteristics of EO and ESM data, contrasting them with "natural images", and explain the additional challenges and opportunities they present. Moreover, we review current applications of NC across various EO modalities and explore the limited efforts in ESM compression to date. The advent of self-supervised learning (SSL) and foundation models (FM) has advanced methods to efficiently distill representations from vast unlabeled data. We connect these developments to NC for EO, highlighting the similarities between the two fields and elaborate on the potential of transferring compressed feature representations for machine--to--machine communication. Based on insights drawn from this review, we devise future directions relevant to applications in EO and ESM.

Abstract: Mammography, an X-ray-based imaging technique, remains central to the early detection of breast cancer. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled increasingly sophisticated computer-aided diagnostic methods, evolving from patch-based classifiers to whole-image approaches and then to multi-view architectures that jointly analyze complementary projections. Despite this progress, several critical questions remain unanswered. In this study, we systematically investigate these issues by addressing five key research questions: (1) the role of patch classifiers in performance, (2) the transferability of natural-image-trained backbones, (3) the advantages of learn-to-resize over conventional downscaling, (4) the contribution of multi-view integration, and (5) the robustness of findings across varying image quality. Beyond benchmarking, our experiments demonstrate clear performance gains over prior work. For the CBIS-DDSM dataset, we improved single-view AUC from 0.8153 to 0.8343, and multiple-view AUC from 0.8483 to 0.8658. Using a new comparative method, we also observed a 0.0217 AUC increase when extending from single to multiple-view analysis. On the complete VinDr-Mammo dataset, the multiple-view approach further improved results, achieving a 0.0492 AUC increase over single view and reaching 0.8511 AUC overall. These results establish new state-of-the-art benchmarks, providing clear evidence of the advantages of multi-view architectures for mammogram interpretation. Beyond performance, our analysis offers principled insights into model design and transfer learning strategies, contributing to the development of more accurate and reliable breast cancer screening tools. The inference code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/dpetrini/multiple-view.

<title>BIM-Constrained Optimization for Accurate Localization and Deviation Correction in Construction Monitoring</title>

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) applications for construction monitoring rely on real-time environmental tracking to visualize architectural elements. However, construction sites present significant challenges for traditional tracking methods due to featureless surfaces, dynamic changes, and drift accumulation, leading to misalignment between digital models and the physical world. This paper proposes a BIM-aware drift correction method to address these challenges. Instead of relying solely on SLAM-based localization, we align ``as-built" detected planes from the real-world environment with ``as-planned" architectural planes in BIM. Our method performs robust plane matching and computes a transformation (TF) between SLAM (S) and BIM (B) origin frames using optimization techniques, minimizing drift over time. By incorporating BIM as prior structural knowledge, we can achieve improved long-term localization and enhanced AR visualization accuracy in noisy construction environments. The method is evaluated through real-world experiments, showing significant reductions in drift-induced errors and optimized alignment consistency. On average, our system achieves a reduction of 52.24% in angular deviations and a reduction of 60.8% in the distance error of the matched walls compared to the initial manual alignment by the user.

Abstract: Face recognition poses serious privacy risks due to its reliance on sensitive and immutable biometric data. While modern systems mitigate privacy risks by mapping facial images to embeddings (commonly regarded as privacy-preserving), model inversion attacks reveal that identity information can still be recovered, exposing critical vulnerabilities. However, existing attacks are often computationally expensive and lack generalization, especially those requiring target-specific training. Even training-free approaches suffer from limited identity controllability, hindering faithful reconstruction of nuanced or unseen identities. In this work, we propose DiffMI, the first diffusion-driven, training-free model inversion attack. DiffMI introduces a novel pipeline combining robust latent code initialization, a ranked adversarial refinement strategy, and a statistically grounded, confidence-aware optimization objective. DiffMI applies directly to unseen target identities and face recognition models, offering greater adaptability than training-dependent approaches while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our method achieves 84.42%--92.87% attack success rates against inversion-resilient systems and outperforms the best prior training-free GAN-based approach by 4.01%--9.82%. The implementation is available at https://github.com/azrealwang/DiffMI.

<title>MoRE-Brain: Routed Mixture of Experts for Interpretable and Generalizable Cross-Subject fMRI Visual Decoding</title>

arXiv:2505.15946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoding visual experiences from fMRI offers a powerful avenue to understand human perception and develop advanced brain-computer interfaces. However, current progress often prioritizes maximizing reconstruction fidelity while overlooking interpretability, an essential aspect for deriving neuroscientific insight. To address this gap, we propose MoRE-Brain, a neuro-inspired framework designed for high-fidelity, adaptable, and interpretable visual reconstruction. MoRE-Brain uniquely employs a hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts architecture where distinct experts process fMRI signals from functionally related voxel groups, mimicking specialized brain networks. The experts are first trained to encode fMRI into the frozen CLIP space. A finetuned diffusion model then synthesizes images, guided by expert outputs through a novel dual-stage routing mechanism that dynamically weighs expert contributions across the diffusion process. MoRE-Brain offers three main advancements: First, it introduces a novel Mixture-of-Experts architecture grounded in brain network principles for neuro-decoding. Second, it achieves efficient cross-subject generalization by sharing core expert networks while adapting only subject-specific routers. Third, it provides enhanced mechanistic insight, as the explicit routing reveals precisely how different modeled brain regions shape the semantic and spatial attributes of the reconstructed image. Extensive experiments validate MoRE-Brain's high reconstruction fidelity, with bottleneck analyses further demonstrating its effective utilization of fMRI signals, distinguishing genuine neural decoding from over-reliance on generative priors. Consequently, MoRE-Brain marks a substantial advance towards more generalizable and interpretable fMRI-based visual decoding. Code will be publicly available soon: https://github.com/yuxiangwei0808/MoRE-Brain.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal tasks. However, their performance often deteriorates in long-context scenarios, particularly long videos. While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) has been widely adopted for length generalization in Large Language Models (LLMs), extending vanilla RoPE to capture the intricate spatial-temporal dependencies in videos remains an unsolved challenge. Existing methods typically allocate different frequencies within RoPE to encode 3D positional information. However, these allocation strategies mainly rely on heuristics, lacking in-depth theoretical analysis. In this paper, we first study how different allocation strategies impact the long-context capabilities of VLMs. Our analysis reveals that current multimodal RoPEs fail to reliably capture semantic similarities over extended contexts. To address this issue, we propose HoPE, a Hybrid of Position Embedding designed to improve the long-context capabilities of VLMs. HoPE introduces a hybrid frequency allocation strategy for reliable semantic modeling over arbitrarily long contexts, and a dynamic temporal scaling mechanism to facilitate robust learning and flexible inference across diverse context lengths. Extensive experiments across four video benchmarks on long video understanding and retrieval tasks demonstrate that HoPE consistently outperforms existing methods, confirming its effectiveness. Our code is available at https://github.com/hrlics/HoPE.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly slow-thinking models, often exhibit severe hallucination, outputting incorrect content due to an inability to accurately recognize knowledge boundaries during reasoning. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance complex reasoning abilities, its outcome-oriented reward mechanism often lacks factual supervision over the thinking process, further exacerbating the hallucination problem. To address the high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced RL, KnowRL. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. KnowRL guides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality reward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping them recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during RL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning strategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning steps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process. Experimental results on three hallucination evaluation datasets and two reasoning evaluation datasets demonstrate that KnowRL effectively mitigates hallucinations in slow-thinking models while maintaining their original strong reasoning capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/KnowRL.

Abstract: Cognitive science research treats visual perception, the ability to understand and make sense of a visual input, as one of the early developmental signs of intelligence. Its TVPS-4 framework categorizes and tests human perception into seven skills such as visual discrimination, and form constancy. Do Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) match up to humans in basic perception? Even though there are many benchmarks that evaluate MLLMs on advanced reasoning and knowledge skills, there is limited research that focuses evaluation on simple perception. In response, we introduce Percept-V, a dataset containing 6000 program-generated uncontaminated images divided into 30 domains, where each domain tests one or more TVPS-4 skills. Our focus is on perception, so we make our domains quite simple and the reasoning and knowledge required for solving them are minimal. Since modern-day MLLMs can solve much more complex tasks, our a-priori expectation is that they will solve these domains very easily. Contrary to our belief, our experiments show a weak performance of SoTA proprietary and open-source MLLMs compared to very high human performance on Percept-V. We find that as number of objects in the image increases, performance goes down rather fast. Our experiments also identify the perception skills that are considerably harder for all models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare imaging has revolutionized diagnostic medicine and clinical decision-making processes. This work presents an intelligent multimodal framework for medical image analysis that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in healthcare diagnostics. The framework integrates Google Gemini 2.5 Flash for automated tumor detection and clinical report generation across multiple imaging modalities including CT, MRI, X-ray, and Ultrasound. The system combines visual feature extraction with natural language processing to enable contextual image interpretation, incorporating coordinate verification mechanisms and probabilistic Gaussian modeling for anomaly distribution. Multi-layered visualization techniques generate detailed medical illustrations, overlay comparisons, and statistical representations to enhance clinical confidence, with location measurement achieving 80 pixels average deviation. Result processing utilizes precise prompt engineering and textual analysis to extract structured clinical information while maintaining interpretability. Experimental evaluations demonstrated high performance in anomaly detection across multiple modalities. The system features a user-friendly Gradio interface for clinical workflow integration and demonstrates zero-shot learning capabilities to reduce dependence on large datasets. This framework represents a significant advancement in automated diagnostic support and radiological workflow efficiency, though clinical validation and multi-center evaluation are necessary prior to widespread adoption.

Unlike previous methods, RoLA operates directly on a single image without requiring additional hardware or digital assets. Our framework democratizes robotic data generation by producing massive visuomotor robotic demonstrations within minutes from a wide range of image sources, including camera captures, robotic datasets, and Internet images. At its core, our approach combines a novel method for single-view physical scene recovery with an efficient visual blending strategy for photorealistic data collection.

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further reference.

Summary:
EvoQuality is a novel self-supervised framework for improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage without the need for human-annotated data. It adapts the principle of self-consistency to image quality assessment (IQA) by using pairwise majority voting to generate pseudo-labels for relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then used to create a fidelity reward that guides the model's evolution through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging its own predictions, EvoQuality enhances the VLM's zero-shot performance by 31.8% on PLCC across various IQA benchmarks. Surprisingly, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality outperforms state-of-the-art supervised VLM-based IQA models on 5 out of 7 benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in autonomously refining the VLM's perceptual capabilities. <div>

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities, their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA) remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks. Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA benchmarks.

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision (FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit). Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs, worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters, without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1 accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation alongside the publication of this paper.

<div> Few-shot semantic segmentation, deep learning, infrastructure inspection, Enhanced Feature Pyramid Network, prototypical learning <br />
<br />
Summary: Our study introduces the Enhanced Feature Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation in infrastructure inspection, addressing the scarcity of labeled data and the need to learn new defect categories efficiently. The framework includes an adaptive E-FPN encoder for multi-scale feature extraction, prototypical learning with masked average pooling for prototype generation, and attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local self-attention, and cross-attention. Experimental results demonstrate excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration achieving 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way classification testing. The self-attention mechanism significantly improves performance, providing a 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over baselines. This framework enables rapid response to new defect types with limited training data, leading to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical infrastructure systems. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well, the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3) attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being 8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical infrastructure systems.

<div> Keywords: Remote photoplethysmography, skin segmentation, heart rate monitoring, motion resistance, real-world applications

Summary: 
The article introduces a new technique for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) that focuses on prioritizing skin regions to enhance signal quality. This novel skin segmentation method can detect skin areas across the body, making it more resistant to movement while eliminating potential sources of interference like the mouth, eyes, and hair. The model is evaluated on existing datasets and a new dataset called SYNC-rPPG, showcasing its ability to capture heartbeats accurately even in challenging conditions such as talking and head rotation. The mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates remains low, outperforming other methods. Additionally, the model demonstrates high accuracy in detecting various skin tones, making it a promising option for real-world applications in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, and smart vehicle utilization.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes. We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset, called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for real-world applications.

arXiv:2510.05315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations: automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks, and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples, matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible, real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining diagnostic accuracy.

<div> Keywords: diffusion models, hallucinations, generation diversity, dynamic guidance, score function

Summary: 
Dynamic Guidance, a novel approach introduced in this work, aims to address the issue of hallucinations in diffusion models by selectively sharpening the score function along known artifact-causing directions. This approach targets the structural inconsistencies and out-of-support samples often generated by diffusion models, without sacrificing semantic interpolations that lead to generation diversity. By tackling hallucinations at generation time rather than relying on post-hoc filtering, Dynamic Guidance effectively reduces artifacts on both controlled and natural image datasets. This method significantly outperforms existing baselines, showcasing its potential to enhance the performance of diffusion models in generating high-quality samples with improved accuracy and validity. <div>
arXiv:2510.05356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

<div> cache-based acceleration, diffusion models, inference process, memory consumption, video generation

Summary:
The paper introduces training-free acceleration in video generation using diffusion models. By breaking down the inference process into encoding, denoising, and decoding stages, the authors identify memory surges in the latter two stages when using cache-based acceleration methods. To address this issue, they propose three stage-specific strategies: Asynchronous Cache Swapping, Feature chunk, and Slicing latents to decode. These strategies aim to reduce memory consumption without significantly increasing time overhead. The proposed approach improves inference speed, reduces memory usage, and maintains acceptable quality levels compared to the baseline. The code for the approach is available on GitHub for further exploration. <div>
arXiv:2510.05367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper, we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage, while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range.

Summary:
This study explores the use of thermal imaging to recover past events from present observations. By leveraging the inherent warmth of humans compared to their surroundings, subtle interactions like sitting or touching leave residual heat traces that can be captured by thermal cameras. The proposed time-reversed reconstruction framework utilizes paired RGB and thermal images to reconstruct scene states from a few seconds earlier. This approach combines Visual-Language Models with a constrained diffusion process to ensure semantic and structural consistency in the reconstructed images. Experimental evaluations in controlled scenarios show the feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier. This research represents a significant step towards time-reversed imaging from thermal traces, with potential applications in forensics and scene analysis.

arXiv:2510.05408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging, operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras. This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier, providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

Summary: 
This paper introduces a method for retrieving images using a compound query that combines object instance information from an image with a natural language description. The approach involves a mapping network that translates a local image embedding to a text token suitable for CLIP style text encoding. This method improves image retrieval performance on personalized benchmarks by utilizing a trainable mapping network (pi-map) with frozen CLIP text and image encoders. The training procedure for generating a text token only needs to be performed once for each object instance, streamlining the process. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, showcasing advancements in personalized image retrieval tasks. <div>

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess personalized retrieval.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces a framework called ArchitectHead for creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that allow continuous control over levels of detail (LOD). By parameterizing the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and using a UV feature field with multi-level learnable feature maps, the model can dynamically adjust the number of Gaussians for efficient rendering. The method achieves state-of-the-art quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. Even at the lowest LOD, where only 6.2% of the Gaussians are used, the quality degradation is moderate and the rendering speed improves significantly. This approach enables real-time rendering of 3D head avatars with adjustable LOD levels, balancing visual quality and rendering efficiency. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering. ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining. Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss +7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering speed nearly doubles.

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D 120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3% accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing, outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

Summary:  
Diffusion models are powerful generative models but lack an explicit low-dimensional latent space. A novel Riemannian metric is proposed on the noise space to capture the data manifold learned by diffusion models, encouraging geodesics to align with the data manifold. This metric leads to more natural and faithful image transitions compared to existing methods. The Jacobian of the score function guides the design of the metric, ensuring that paths in the noise space align with the data manifold for improved interpolation results. Experiments on image interpolation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed metric in producing perceptually more natural transitions. The new metric offers a promising approach for exploring and utilizing the learned data manifold in diffusion models.  
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates). We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

<div> multimodal large language models, handwritten student classwork, mathematics education, Experiment A, Experiment B

Summary:
Recent developments in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to an exploration of their potential in assessing and providing feedback on handwritten student math work. Two experiments were conducted to assess MLLM performance in this context. In Experiment A, MLLMs achieved high accuracy in grading arithmetic problems from Ghanaian middle school students but experienced occasional errors. In Experiment B, evaluating mathematical illustrations from American elementary students, MLLMs struggled to interpret the drawings directly but improved significantly when provided with human descriptions. The findings suggest that while MLLMs can analyze arithmetic work effectively, they face challenges in understanding student illustrations without additional context. This research highlights the potential of MLLMs in grading handwritten student work but also underscores the need for further development in visual interpretation capabilities. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines 288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20 with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical illustrations.

<div> self-supervised learning, object recognition, motion understanding, Midway Network, natural videos  
Summary:  
Self-supervised learning methods have traditionally focused on either object recognition or motion understanding separately. The Midway Network introduced in this study is the first architecture to simultaneously learn visual representations for both from natural videos by incorporating latent dynamics modeling. By utilizing a top-down path for inferring motion latents and a dense prediction objective, Midway Network tackles the complexity of multi-object scenes in videos. Pretraining on large-scale datasets, Midway Network outperforms previous methods in semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks. Furthermore, its learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence, as demonstrated with a novel forward feature perturbation analysis method. The results highlight the effectiveness of Midway Network in jointly learning object recognition and motion understanding from unlabeled data.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex, multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis method based on forward feature perturbation.

<div> Keywords: 3D reconstruction, virtual environments, interactive, physical properties, digital twins <br />
Summary: HoloScene is introduced as an interactive 3D reconstruction framework that addresses limitations in current methods by focusing on geometry completeness, object interactivity, physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, and realistic physical properties. The framework uses a scene-graph representation to encode object information and relationships, formulating reconstruction as an energy-based optimization problem that integrates various constraints and priors. Optimization is efficiently carried out using a hybrid approach. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete geometry, physical stability, and realistic rendering. Evaluations show superior performance on benchmark datasets, and practical applications in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin manipulation showcase HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity, physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance, and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships. Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem, integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry, physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance, while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

<div> Keywords: Visual Language Models, CalibCLIP, image retrieval tasks, Contrastive Visual Enhancer, Discriminative Concept Calibrator

Summary:
CalibCLIP is a novel training-free method designed to address the limitations of existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) in text-driven image retrieval tasks. It introduces two key components: the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE) in the visual space and the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC) in the textual space. CVE helps to identify dominant tokens in visual features and dynamically suppress their representations, while DCC differentiates between general and discriminative concepts in the text query to enhance the differentiation among similar samples. The proposed method significantly improves the performance across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in calibrating the suppressive effect of dominant tokens and enhancing discriminative features in VLMs. The code for CalibCLIP is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics, dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this, we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space, we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks, underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP.

<div> Keywords: Autoregressive models, multimodal language, image generation, chain-of-thought reasoning, computational efficiency

Summary: 
ShortCoTI is a new optimization framework designed to streamline the process of generating images using autoregressive multimodal large language models. These models have become popular for image generation, but the use of chain-of-thought reasoning can lead to visual overthinking and unnecessary redundancy. ShortCoTI addresses this issue by encouraging more concise prompts, reducing the computational cost and potential contradictions in generated images. By incorporating a reward system based on task difficulty, ShortCoTI is able to significantly shorten prompt reasoning length while maintaining or even improving image quality metrics. Qualitative analysis demonstrates that the streamlined prompts produced by ShortCoTI are both concise and semantically rich, eliminating verbose explanations and repetitive refinements. Overall, ShortCoTI enhances computational efficiency without sacrificing the fidelity or visual appeal of the generated images. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks (T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of generated images.

Summary:  
Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have been successful in training Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to the development of HOI-R1, a model that explores the potential of language models in Human-object Interaction Detection (HOID) without relying on additional detection modules. HOI-R1 introduces an HOI reasoning process and HOID reward functions to solve the detection task through text alone. Results on the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 outperforms baseline accuracy by 2x with strong generalization capabilities. This approach reduces the complexity of traditional methods that rely on prior knowledge from Vision and Language Models (VLMs) to enhance interaction recognition, offering a promising direction for future HOID research and applications. The source code for HOI-R1 is accessible at https://github.com/cjw2021/HOI-R1.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline with great generalization ability. The source code is available at https://github.com/cjw2021/HOI-R1.

<div> Efficient Control Model, autoregressive models, image generation, distributed architecture, attention layers
Summary:<br /><br />
The Efficient Control Model (ECM) is introduced as a new framework for image synthesis, offering a lightweight control module for spatially-conditioned generation. Using a distributed architecture with context-aware attention layers and a shared gated feed-forward network, the ECM efficiently introduces control signals via real-time generated tokens. The model focuses on early-stage generation to prioritize learning early control sequences, reducing computational costs by decreasing the number of training tokens per iteration. In addition, a temperature scheduling method during inference compensates for potential training inefficiencies for late-stage tokens. Experimental results on scale-based autoregressive models showcase the ECM's ability to achieve high-fidelity and diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while significantly improving training and inference efficiency. <div>
arXiv:2510.05610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore, recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

<div> Keywords: autoregressive models, point cloud generation, level-of-detail principle, ShapeNet, scalability potential 

Summary:<br /><br />
The article introduces PointNSP, a generative framework for autoregressive point cloud generation that improves upon existing diffusion-based approaches. The framework utilizes a coarse-to-fine approach inspired by the level-of-detail principle in shape modeling. By incorporating a next-scale prediction paradigm, PointNSP can preserve global shape structure at low resolutions and refine fine-grained geometry at higher scales. This multi-scale factorization aligns with the permutation-invariant nature of point sets, allowing for rich intra-scale interactions without relying on fixed orderings. Experimental results on ShapeNet demonstrate that PointNSP achieves state-of-the-art generation quality within the autoregressive paradigm while also surpassing diffusion-based baselines in efficiency. Particularly in dense generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's scalability potential is highlighted. <div>
arXiv:2510.05613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry, consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

Summary:
Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is crucial for diagnosing dry eye syndrome, but automated segmentation remains challenging due to the lack of annotated datasets. This paper introduces the Tear Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, a comprehensive dataset for tear film analysis. The dataset includes videos annotated with frame-level classification, Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area segmentation. A novel baseline segmentation model, TF-Net, is proposed, achieving a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Benchmark performance on the TFM segmentation subset shows the effectiveness of TF-Net. Additionally, a real-time pipeline, TF-Collab, is designed to automate tear film analysis by leveraging models trained on multiple tasks of the TFM dataset. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of both TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a strong foundation for future research in ocular surface diagnostics. The code and TFM datasets are publicly available for further exploration.

Abstract: Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye syndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack of annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247 frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear', 'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research in ocular surface diagnostics.

Summary: <br />
InstaGeo is a new open-source framework designed to streamline the process of utilizing open-access multispectral imagery for geospatial applications. It addresses challenges such as automated data curation, model distillation for compact models, and seamless deployment as web-map applications. By using InstaGeo, researchers were able to reproduce datasets and train models with minimal accuracy loss compared to original models. The framework also enables the creation of state-of-the-art datasets, leading to significant improvements in crop segmentation accuracy. InstaGeo reduces the size of models and their carbon footprint, making them more sustainable for real-time Earth observation applications. This approach emphasizes the importance of data quality and practical, application-driven innovation in geospatial AI. <div>
arXiv:2510.05617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs) for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of -0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time, large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data quality and application-driven innovation.

Summary:
The study explores the reliance of state-of-the-art image forensics detectors on frequency-domain artifacts, particularly spectral peaks in synthetic image generation detection. By systematically analyzing the impact of removing spectral peaks on various detectors, the research challenges the common assumption that detectors fundamentally depend on these peaks. Additionally, a linear detector exclusively relying on frequency peaks is introduced, providing a transparent and interpretable baseline for comparison. The findings suggest that most detectors are not primarily reliant on spectral peaks, emphasizing the need for more transparent and reliable forensic tools in the field of image forensics. This research contributes to improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of image forensics tools, paving the way for enhanced reliability in detecting AI-generated images.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently, frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However, state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable forensic tools.

<div> Keywords: Deep metric learning, hyperbolic space, proxy-based losses, CHEST loss, state-of-the-art performance

Summary:
This paper introduces a new approach, the Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss, for deep metric learning in hyperbolic space. While traditional methods rely on pair-based or unsupervised regularization losses, the CHEST loss combines proxy-based losses in both hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces with a regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. By leveraging the strengths of both spaces, the proposed approach enhances accuracy and stability in learning. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the CHEST loss achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in deep metric learning. <div>
arXiv:2510.05643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points. Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand, supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space. However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

Summary: 
The study introduces two deep learning frameworks to address the challenges in diagnosing ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP). The first framework, AHP-CADNet, utilizes ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to achieve accurate and interpretable automated diagnosis. It shows high accuracy rates ranging from 96.9% to 99.0% across classification tasks and low prediction errors for continuous variables. The second framework focuses on imputing missing data using a curriculum learning-based approach that progressively incorporates structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance diagnostic robustness. The imputation framework achieves high accuracy rates (93.46-99.78%) across all clinical variables, with significant improvements in clinical dependency modeling. The findings affirm the effectiveness of both frameworks in automated diagnosis and overcoming missing data challenges in clinical settings. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry; however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to 0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001). These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction, affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together. Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings, limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video summarization, originally considering just the visual content of the video, to take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired modalities in order to promote the parts of the full-length video with the highest relevance to the user-provided script. Furthermore, we extend two large-scale datasets for video summarization (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum), to make them suitable for training and evaluation of script-driven multimodal video summarization methods. Experimental comparisons document the competitiveness of our SD-MVSum method against other SOTA approaches for script-driven and generic video summarization. Our new method and extended datasets are available at: https://github.com/IDT-ITI/SD-MVSum.

<div> Keywords: liver cancer, histological subtyping, Whole Slide Images, TME, ARGUS <br />
Summary: <br />
Primary liver malignancies, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), are highly heterogeneous cancers with diverse prognoses. Current approaches to histological subtyping often overlook crucial features within Whole Slide Images (WSIs), such as the hierarchical pyramid structure and tumor microenvironment (TME). ARGUS, a novel framework, addresses this gap by capturing macro-meso-micro hierarchical information in the TME. It introduces a micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level patterns and a Hierarchical Field-of-Views Alignment module to model hierarchical interactions in WSIs. The fusion of micro-geometry and FoVs features through Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy enhances the holistic representation of phenotype interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private datasets demonstrate that ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art performance in histological subtyping of liver cancer, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for clinical practice. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs) encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment (TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.

Summary: 
The article introduces a unified training-free pipeline for realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a background scene. It addresses the challenges of determining the correct location and poses of the person, and performing high-quality personalization conditioned on the background. By leveraging pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, the method combines inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance to achieve affordance-aware global editing. The proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity, clothing, and body features from a single reference image. This approach stands out as the first to perform realistic human insertions into scenes in a training-free manner, achieving state-of-the-art results in diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in both backgrounds and subjects. <div>

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity, clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in backgrounds and subjects.

Summary:<br />
This study focuses on automated video editing for multicamera recordings of classical music concerts. It addresses the challenges of determining when to cut and how to cut in the editing process. A novel multimodal architecture is proposed for temporal segmentation, integrating audio signals, image embedding, and scalar temporal features through a convolutional-transformer pipeline. For spatial selection, an updated approach with a CLIP-based encoder and constrained distractor selection is introduced. A dataset was created using a pseudo-labeling approach, clustering raw video data into coherent shot segments. Results show that the models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points and achieving competitive visual shot selection. This work advances the state of the art in automated video editing for classical music concerts. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut. Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments. We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art in multimodal automated video editing.

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost, image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups. The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

<div> Semantic Visual Tokenizer, Vision Reasoning, In-context Learning, Multimodal Reasoning, Object-level encoding

Summary:
Recent advances in language models have shown great progress in reasoning and in-context learning, but vision models have lagged behind. The gap may be due to the lack of semantic and contextual guidance in current vision transformer training. This paper proposes modeling visual objects as the equivalent of words in language to improve semantic understanding in vision models. The authors introduce a semantic-grounded objective called masked image modeling (MIM), where masks are applied to visual objects for testing. Results show that object-level representation helps in learning real-world distributions and improves reasoning abilities in tasks like visual question answering. By incorporating object-level encoding, vision models can achieve stronger performance in understanding visual information. This study emphasizes the effectiveness of object-level encoding in vision models and provides a promising direction for future research in developing more robust vision encoders and tokenizers.

Summary: <br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.05674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning. However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas. In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective. Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers. Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer, Vision Reasoning, In-context Learning, Multimodal Reasoning

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces AgeBooth, a novel approach for enhancing age control in identity personalization models without requiring extensive age-varied datasets. By leveraging the linear nature of aging, AgeBooth employs age-conditioned prompt blending and age-specific LoRA fusion techniques, utilizing SVDMix for matrix fusion. These methods enable the generation of realistic and identity-consistent face images at different ages from a single reference photo. The results demonstrate AgeBooth's superior age control and visual quality compared to existing editing-based methods. This innovative approach addresses the challenge of accurately controlling age while preserving identity in diffusion model research, offering a more cost-effective and efficient solution for generating age-specific portraits. <div>

Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based methods.

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue, we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot semantic segmentation.

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition, we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and framework for furthering universal AI image detection.

Summary:
ALISE is a new framework for outdoor LiDAR point cloud instance segmentation that operates without any human annotations. It leverages Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to generate initial pseudo-labels guided by text and images. These labels are then refined using a spatio-temporal voting module that combines 2D and 3D semantics for offline and online optimization. To enhance feature learning, ALISE introduces 2D prior-based losses and a prototype-based contrastive loss for semantic supervision, resulting in superior performance. The framework achieves a new state-of-the-art in unsupervised 3D instance segmentation, even surpassing supervised methods like MWSIS in mAP by 2.53%. ALISE's comprehensive approach showcases the potential for advanced unsupervised techniques in the field of 3D instance segmentation. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth (GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

Summary:
The paper introduces OneVision, an end-to-end generative framework that aims to improve traditional vision search by addressing the challenges of multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA). OneVision utilizes VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization encoding, to align different object representations across various viewpoints while maintaining distinctive features. A multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is then employed to combine strong visual similarity priors with user-specific information for personalized preference generation. Offline evaluations show that OneVision performs similarly to MCA but improves inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, OneVision demonstrates significant online improvements in item CTR (+2.15%), CVR (+2.27%), and order volume (+3.12%). These results highlight the effectiveness of a semantic ID-centric, generative architecture in unifying retrieval and personalization, simplifying the serving pathway, and enhancing user experience in vision search systems.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems, follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation. In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and +3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric, generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while simplifying the serving pathway.

Summary:
Deep learning in remote sensing image scene classification relies on large amounts of labeled data for effective generalization, but obtaining highly reliable labels can be costly and limited. This study proposes a method that combines weak sources of labeled data with a small reliable dataset to create multisource labeled datasets. A novel training strategy incorporating the reliability of each data source is introduced, using transition matrices to weigh each label during the training process. This weighting scheme at the gradient level ensures that each instance contributes differently to the optimization of classes. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method in leveraging unreliable sources of labels for training deep neural networks in remote sensing applications.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used during the training process to weigh each label according to the related source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

Summary:  
- Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying machine learning models effectively.  
- Most methods focus on final-layer representations, but intermediate layers in pre-trained models can provide rich signals for OOD detection.  
- Residual connections in models can subtly transform input projections to encode diverse information across layers.  
- An entropy-based criterion can automatically identify layers with complementary information for OOD detection without access to OOD data.  
- Selectively incorporating intermediate representations can significantly improve OOD detection accuracy by up to 10% in far-OOD and over 7% in near-OOD scenarios compared to existing methods. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the \textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode \textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers, we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting -- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various model architectures and training objectives.

Abstract: The Steered Mixture of Experts regression framework has demonstrated strong performance in image reconstruction, compression, denoising, and super-resolution. However, its high computational cost limits practical applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising, which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image processing tasks.

<div> Keywords: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance, deep learning, keyframe detection, cine CMR, cardiac function<br />
Summary: <br />
A new method for detecting keyframes in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) images has been proposed, using self-supervised deep learning. The method accurately identifies five keyframes in short-axis and four-chamber long-axis cine CMR, providing valuable insights into global cardiac contraction and relaxation patterns. By deriving dense deformable registration fields and computing a 1D motion descriptor, keyframes are determined based on characteristic curves, improving detection accuracy by up to 51% for short-axis and 47% for long-axis views in end-diastole and end-systole frames. The approach can detect additional keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with minimal cyclic frame difference, enabling temporally aligned inter- and intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics regardless of cycle or phase lengths. The method was evaluated using multiple datasets and showed promising results for detecting keyframes in CMR images. The code is available on GitHub for further exploration and research. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.05819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole (ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis (SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&amp;Ms-2 (n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&amp;Ms (n=345) and ACDC (n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase lengths.

<div> Motion priors, optical flow, video understanding, multimodal large language models, redundancy <br />
Summary:
Flow4Agent is a framework designed to improve long-form video understanding, tackling issues of redundancy in spatial and temporal content. It integrates motion priors from optical flow to enhance the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in analyzing extended video sequences. Two key modules, Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO) and Motion Token Pruning (MTP), work together to refine video representations at different levels. TGO optimizes temporal hierarchies based on flow and semantic priors to filter out irrelevant scene information. MTP utilizes fine-grained optical flow data to prune redundant video tokens within frames. Experimental results show superior performance of Flow4Agent compared to existing methods on various video MLLM benchmarks, especially excelling in hour-level video understanding tasks, achieving impressive accuracy rates on Video-MME, MLVU, and LongVideoBench datasets. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.05836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper, we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding. Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO) adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP) further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However, these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support routine application in biological research. In this work, we present acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten application workflows is open source and publicly available at https://github.com/JuBiotech/acia-workflows.

BioAutoML-NAS is a novel model that leverages multimodal data, including images and metadata, for accurate insect classification. The model utilizes neural architecture search to automatically learn the best operations within each cell of the network, extracting detailed image features.

arXiv:2510.05888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81% accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall, and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable farming.

Summary:
Discrete token prediction in visual autoregressive (AR) models has led to significant advancements in image generation but poses challenges for synthetic image detection. A new approach, Discrete Distribution Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE), leverages the unique characteristics of AR-generated images for detection. By considering the frequency distribution bias of codebooks in real and fake images, D$^3$QE introduces a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that incorporates dynamic codebook frequency statistics in its attention mechanism. This method, evaluated on the ARForensics dataset encompassing 7 mainstream AR models, demonstrates high detection accuracy and generalizability across different models, remaining robust to real-world perturbations. The code for D$^3$QE is available at the provided GitHub link. <div>

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection. Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to real-world perturbations.

Summary: 
Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL) is proposed as a new paradigm for medical image segmentation that reduces annotation effort by leveraging weak prompts instead of dense labels. By using bounding boxes or points as prompts, WS-ICL eliminates the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompts, making it a more efficient approach. Experimental results on three benchmarks show that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. The proposed model is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm, demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing annotation burden while maintaining segmentation accuracy. WS-ICL stands as a promising step towards more efficient and unified universal models for medical image segmentation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Universal models for medical image segmentation, such as interactive and in-context learning (ICL) models, offer strong generalization but require extensive annotations. Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition, WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified universal models for medical image segmentation. Our code and model are publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Weak-ICL.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a new large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics setting, addressing the limitations of existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD and VisA. The dataset contains over 230,000 images with more than 29,000 defective instances and 48,000 distinct objects, making it significantly larger and more diverse than previous datasets. The authors evaluate multiple state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods on the dataset and find that existing methods struggle to achieve high performance, with the best AUROC score being 56.96%. The dataset poses challenges due to the diversity and variability of object pose and appearance in retail logistics settings. The authors provide the dataset for download and encourage further research in the field of anomaly detection in retail logistics. <div>
arXiv:2510.05903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000 images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under https://www.kaputt-dataset.com.

Summary: 
This work introduces a comprehensive study of token mixers for medical imaging within the MetaFormer architecture. The evaluation covers image classification and semantic segmentation tasks across eight diverse medical datasets. Low-complexity token mixers such as grouped convolution and pooling prove sufficient for classification tasks, with pretrained weights still useful despite domain gaps. For segmentation, convolutional token mixers show essential local inductive bias, with grouped convolutions emerging as the preferred choice due to reduced runtime and parameter count. The MetaFormer's channel-MLPs are found to provide necessary cross-channel interactions. The study emphasizes the importance of choosing the right token mixer design for optimal performance in medical imaging tasks. The code for this study is openly available on GitHub to support further research in the field.

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets, its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images. Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising. This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories: Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal, and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors, conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the potential of foundation models.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology of adapting the representation of videos based on the dynamics of their scene content variation. In particular, we demonstrate how the clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues can be leveraged to learn an adaptive video representation for separating structurally distinct morphologies of a video. We extend the morphological component analysis (MCA) algorithm, which uses multiple predefined incoherent dictionaries and a sparsity prior to separate distinct sources in signals, by introducing our novel eigenspace clustering technique to obtain data-driven MCA dictionaries, which we call dynamic morphological component analysis (DMCA). After deriving our novel algorithm, we offer a motivational example of DMCA applied to a still image, then demonstrate DMCA's effectiveness in denoising applications on videos from the Adobe 240fps dataset. Afterwards, we provide an example of DMCA enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a faint target summed with a sea state, and conclude the paper by applying DMCA to separate a bicycle from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

Abstract: Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes, resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in the era of generative AI.

These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm. We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable to future hail events.

Abstract: Generating accurate and coherent image captions in a continual learning setting remains a major challenge due to catastrophic forgetting and the difficulty of aligning evolving visual concepts with language over time. In this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone, our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes, and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Emergent AI Surveillance: Overlearned Person Re-Identification and Its Mitigation in Law Enforcement Context</title>

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved. We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images. These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly benign applications?

Abstract: We introduce Universal Neural Architecture Space (UniNAS), a generic search space for neural architecture search (NAS) which unifies convolutional networks, transformers, and their hybrid architectures under a single, flexible framework. Our approach enables discovery of novel architectures as well as analyzing existing architectures in a common framework. We also propose a new search algorithm that allows traversing the proposed search space, and demonstrate that the space contains interesting architectures, which, when using identical training setup, outperform state-of-the-art hand-crafted architectures. Finally, a unified toolkit including a standardized training and evaluation protocol is introduced to foster reproducibility and enable fair comparison in NAS research. Overall, this work opens a pathway towards systematically exploring the full spectrum of neural architectures with a unified graph-based NAS perspective.

<title>VideoMiner: Iteratively Grounding Key Frames of Hour-Long Videos via Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization</title>

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models (MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However, for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/caoxinye/VideoMiner.

Abstract: Existing 3D face modeling methods usually depend on 3D Morphable Models, which inherently constrain the representation capacity to fixed shape priors. Optimization-based approaches offer high-quality reconstructions but tend to be computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce GLVD, a hybrid method for 3D face reconstruction from few-shot images that extends Learned Vertex Descent (LVD) by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global structural guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints. By incorporating relative spatial encoding, GLVD iteratively refines mesh vertices without requiring dense 3D supervision. This enables expressive and adaptable geometry reconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency. GLVD achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains highly competitive in multi-view scenarios, all while substantially reducing inference time.

Abstract: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments, with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.

Abstract: CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent). However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha, etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning, we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

<title>There is More to Attention: Statistical Filtering Enhances Explanations in Vision Transformers</title>

arXiv:2510.06070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important with the rise of large transformer models, yet many explanation methods designed for CNNs transfer poorly to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing ViT explanations often rely on attention weights, which tend to yield noisy maps as they capture token-to-token interactions within each layer.While attribution methods incorporating MLP blocks have been proposed, we argue that attention remains a valuable and interpretable signal when properly filtered. We propose a method that combines attention maps with a statistical filtering, initially proposed for CNNs, to remove noisy or uninformative patterns and produce more faithful explanations. We further extend our approach with a class-specific variant that yields discriminative explanations. Evaluation against popular state-of-the-art methods demonstrates that our approach produces sharper and more interpretable maps. In addition to perturbation-based faithfulness metrics, we incorporate human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception, arguing that human interpretability remains essential for XAI. Across multiple datasets, our approach consistently outperforms or is comparable to the SOTA methods while remaining efficient and human plausible.

<title>When Thinking Drifts: Evidential Grounding for Robust Video Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks, its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10 diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

Abstract: Despite the success of advanced segmentation frameworks such as TotalSegmentator (TS), accurate segmentations of the left atrial appendage (LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) remain a significant challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we present the first open-source, anatomically coherent dataset of curated, high-resolution segmentations for these structures, supplemented with whole-heart labels produced by TS on the publicly available ImageCAS dataset consisting of 1000 cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) scans. One purpose of the data set is to foster novel approaches to the analysis of LAA morphology.
  LAA segmentations on ImageCAS were generated using a state-of-the-art segmentation framework developed specifically for high resolution LAA segmentation. We trained the network on a large private dataset with manual annotations provided by medical readers guided by a trained cardiologist and transferred the model to ImageCAS data. CA labels were improved from the original ImageCAS annotations, while PV segmentations were refined from TS outputs. In addition, we provide a list of scans from ImageCAS that contains common data flaws such as step artefacts, LAAs extending beyond the scanner's field of view, and other types of data defects.

<title>Compact Multi-level-prior Tensor Representation for Hyperspectral Image Super-resolution</title>

Abstract: Fusing a hyperspectral image with a multispectral image acquired over the same scene, \textit{i.e.}, hyperspectral image super-resolution, has become a popular computational way to access the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image. To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The code implementation will be available from https://github.com/WongYinJ.

<title>Multimodal Feature Prototype Learning for Interpretable and Discriminative Cancer Survival Prediction</title>

Abstract: Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However, the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is available at https://github.com/JSLiam94/FeatProto.

Abstract: Deep learning in medical imaging is often limited by scarce and imbalanced annotated data. We present SSGNet, a unified framework that combines class specific generative modeling with iterative semisupervised pseudo labeling to enhance both classification and segmentation. Rather than functioning as a standalone model, SSGNet augments existing baselines by expanding training data with StyleGAN3 generated images and refining labels through iterative pseudo labeling. Experiments across multiple medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate consistent gains in classification and segmentation performance, while Frechet Inception Distance analysis confirms the high quality of generated samples. These results highlight SSGNet as a practical strategy to mitigate annotation bottlenecks and improve robustness in medical image analysis.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks: translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework, MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone, leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context, and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness. Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR 0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2, plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

<title>Deforming Videos to Masks: Flow Matching for Referring Video Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic `locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts (e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ of 51.1 in MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7), demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks as continuous deformation processes.

Abstract: We tackle the problem of forecasting bimanual 3D hand motion & articulation from a single image in everyday settings. To address the lack of 3D hand annotations in diverse settings, we design an annotation pipeline consisting of a diffusion model to lift 2D hand keypoint sequences to 4D hand motion. For the forecasting model, we adopt a diffusion loss to account for the multimodality in hand motion distribution. Extensive experiments across 6 datasets show the benefits of training on diverse data with imputed labels (14% improvement) and effectiveness of our lifting (42% better) & forecasting (16.4% gain) models, over the best baselines, especially in zero-shot generalization to everyday images.

Abstract: Video-conditioned 4D shape generation aims to recover time-varying 3D geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from an input video. In this work, we introduce a native video-to-4D shape generation framework that synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end from the video. Our framework introduces three key components based on large-scale pre-trained 3D models: (i) a temporal attention that conditions generation on all frames while producing a time-indexed dynamic representation; (ii) a time-aware point sampling and 4D latent anchoring that promote temporally consistent geometry and texture; and (iii) noise sharing across frames to enhance temporal stability. Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and even topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse in-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and reduces failure modes compared with the baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments. Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First, while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the driving models and generative world models (Drive&amp;Gen) to address these questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains, facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational contexts.

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse, high-quality images, yet they struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data, which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth, predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer, and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents, which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without altering the depicted scene.

<title>Dropping the D: RGB-D SLAM Without the Depth Sensor</title>

Abstract: We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves RGB-D-level accuracy without relying on depth sensors. The system replaces active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation network. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences, matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale, marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

<title>EgoNight: Towards Egocentric Vision Understanding at Night with a Challenging Benchmark</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06218</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models (MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions. Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

<title>Human3R: Everyone Everywhere All at Once</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.06219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies ("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning, to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in https://fanegg.github.io/Human3R

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) is a key approach for applying large language models (LLMs) and agents to real-world knowledge bases, yet current evaluations are fragmented, focusing on either text or images in isolation or on simplified multimodal setups that fail to capture document-centric multimodal use cases. In this paper, we introduce UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from 70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by multiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2) image-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools, prompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate. Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.

Abstract: Current methods for automated assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment via picture description often neglect the visual narrative path - the sequence and locations of elements a speaker described in the picture. Analyses of spatio-semantic features capture this path using content information units (CIUs), but manual tagging or dictionary-based mapping is labor-intensive. This study proposes a BERT-based pipeline, fine tuned with binary cross-entropy and pairwise ranking loss, for automated CIU extraction and ordering from the Cookie Theft picture description. Evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation, it achieves 93% median precision, 96% median recall in CIU detection, and 24% sequence error rates. The proposed method extracts features that exhibit strong Pearson correlations with ground truth, surpassing the dictionary-based baseline in external validation. These features also perform comparably to those derived from manual annotations in evaluating group differences via ANCOVA. The pipeline is shown to effectively characterize visual narrative paths for cognitive impairment assessment, with the implementation and models open-sourced to public.

<title>Discretized Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Model for Deep Spiking Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives to traditional artificial neural networks, leveraging asynchronous and biologically inspired neuron dynamics. Among existing neuron models, the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations' parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for deep SNNs, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability.

<title>SafeGuider: Robust and Practical Content Safety Control for Text-to-Image Models</title>

Abstract: Text-to-image models have shown remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images from natural language descriptions. However, these models are highly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which can bypass safety measures and produce harmful content. Despite various defensive strategies, achieving robustness against attacks while maintaining practical utility in real-world applications remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we first conduct an empirical study of the text encoder in the Stable Diffusion (SD) model, which is a widely used and representative text-to-image model. Our findings reveal that the [EOS] token acts as a semantic aggregator, exhibiting distinct distributional patterns between benign and adversarial prompts in its embedding space. Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{SafeGuider}, a two-step framework designed for robust safety control without compromising generation quality. SafeGuider combines an embedding-level recognition model with a safety-aware feature erasure beam search algorithm. This integration enables the framework to maintain high-quality image generation for benign prompts while ensuring robust defense against both in-domain and out-of-domain attacks. SafeGuider demonstrates exceptional effectiveness in minimizing attack success rates, achieving a maximum rate of only 5.48\% across various attack scenarios. Moreover, instead of refusing to generate or producing black images for unsafe prompts, \textbf{SafeGuider} generates safe and meaningful images, enhancing its practical utility. In addition, SafeGuider is not limited to the SD model and can be effectively applied to other text-to-image models, such as the Flux model, demonstrating its versatility and adaptability across different architectures. We hope that SafeGuider can shed some light on the practical deployment of secure text-to-image systems.

<title>Beyond Monolithic Rewards: A Hybrid and Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization for MLLM Alignment</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05283</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.05283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i) model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical reasoning and problem solving.

<title>RegMix: Adversarial Mutual and Generalization Regularization for Enhancing DNN Robustness</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.05317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective defense against adversarial attacks. The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of its loss function and regularization term. The most widely used loss function in adversarial training is cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE) as its regularization objective. However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization between two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness in adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i) weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization and enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to existing regularization-based approaches.

Abstract: Purpose: To develop and validate No-New SAM2 (nnsam2) for few-shot segmentation of lumbar paraspinal muscles using only a single annotated slice per dataset, and to assess its statistical comparability with expert measurements across multi-sequence MRI and multi-protocol CT.
  Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 1,219 scans (19,439 slices) from 762 participants across six datasets. Six slices (one per dataset) served as labeled examples, while the remaining 19,433 slices were used for testing. In this minimal-supervision setting, nnsam2 used single-slice SAM2 prompts to generate pseudo-labels, which were pooled across datasets and refined through three sequential, independent nnU-Net models. Segmentation performance was evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and automated measurements-including muscle volume, fat ratio, and CT attenuation-were assessed with two one-sided tests (TOST) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC).
  Results: nnsam2 outperformed vanilla SAM2, its medical variants, TotalSegmentator, and the leading few-shot method, achieving DSCs of 0.94-0.96 on MR images and 0.92-0.93 on CT. Automated and expert measurements were statistically equivalent for muscle volume (MRI/CT), CT attenuation, and Dixon fat ratio (TOST, P < 0.05), with consistently high ICCs (0.86-1.00).
  Conclusion: We developed nnsam2, a state-of-the-art few-shot framework for multi-modality LPM segmentation, producing muscle volume (MRI/CT), attenuation (CT), and fat ratio (Dixon MRI) measurements that were statistically comparable to expert references. Validated across multimodal, multicenter, and multinational cohorts, and released with open code and data, nnsam2 demonstrated high annotation efficiency, robust generalizability, and reproducibility.

arXiv:2510.05635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods are often computationally expensive, require a large amount of data for effective adaptation, or are brittle to hyperparameters. Based on a theoretical foundation of the geometry of the latent space, we are able to significantly improve the alignment between source and distribution-shifted samples by re-centering target data embeddings at the origin. This insight motivates NEO -- a hyperparameter-free fully TTA method, that adds no significant compute compared to vanilla inference. NEO is able to improve the classification accuracy of ViT-Base on ImageNet-C from 55.6% to 59.2% after adapting on just one batch of 64 samples. When adapting on 512 samples NEO beats all 7 TTA methods we compare against on ImageNet-C, ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S and beats 6/7 on CIFAR-10-C, while using the least amount of compute. NEO performs well on model calibration metrics and additionally is able to adapt from 1 class to improve accuracy on 999 other classes in ImageNet-C. On Raspberry Pi and Jetson Orin Nano devices, NEO reduces inference time by 63% and memory usage by 9% compared to baselines. Our results based on 3 ViT architectures and 4 datasets show that NEO can be used efficiently and effectively for TTA.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a biologically grounded approach to reservoir computing (RC), in which a network of cultured biological neurons serves as the reservoir substrate. This system, referred to as biological reservoir computing (BRC), replaces artificial recurrent units with the spontaneous and evoked activity of living neurons. A multi-electrode array (MEA) enables simultaneous stimulation and readout across multiple sites: inputs are delivered through a subset of electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting neural responses, mapping input patterns into a high-dimensional biological feature space. We evaluate the system through a case study on digit classification using a custom dataset. Input images are encoded and delivered to the biological reservoir via electrical stimulation, and the corresponding neural activity is used to train a simple linear classifier. To contextualize the performance of the biological system, we also include a comparison with a standard artificial reservoir trained on the same task. The results indicate that the biological reservoir can effectively support classification, highlighting its potential as a viable and interpretable computational substrate. We believe this work contributes to the broader effort of integrating biological principles into machine learning and aligns with the goals of human-inspired vision by exploring how living neural systems can inform the design of efficient and biologically plausible models.

Abstract: Despite the prevalence of transparent object interactions in human everyday life, transparent robotic manipulation research remains limited to short-horizon tasks and basic grasping capabilities.Although some methods have partially addressed these issues, most of them have limitations in generalizability to novel objects and are insufficient for precise long-horizon robot manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose DeLTa (Demonstration and Language-Guided Novel Transparent Object Manipulation), a novel framework that integrates depth estimation, 6D pose estimation, and vision-language planning for precise long-horizon manipulation of transparent objects guided by natural task instructions. A key advantage of our method is its single-demonstration approach, which generalizes 6D trajectories to novel transparent objects without requiring category-level priors or additional training. Additionally, we present a task planner that refines the VLM-generated plan to account for the constraints of a single-arm, eye-in-hand robot for long-horizon object manipulation tasks. Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing transparent object manipulation approaches, particularly in long-horizon scenarios requiring precise manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection. Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative: they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction, enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation. Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at https://worv-ai.github.io/d2e/

Abstract: Graph embedding has been widely applied in areas such as network analysis, social network mining, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However, current graph construction methods often require the prior definition of neighborhood size, limiting the effective revelation of potential structural correlations in the data. Additionally, graph embedding methods using linear projection heavily rely on a singular pattern mining approach, resulting in relative weaknesses in adapting to different scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model, Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear Graph Embedding (NGLGE), grounded in latent pattern mining. This model introduces an adaptive graph learning method tailored to the neighborhood, effectively revealing intrinsic data correlations. Simultaneously, leveraging a reconstructed low-rank representation and imposing $\ell_{2,0}$ norm constraint on the projection matrix allows for flexible exploration of additional pattern information. Besides, an efficient iterative solving algorithm is derived for the proposed model. Comparative evaluations on datasets from diverse scenarios demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving synthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records, supporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing downstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent (SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients, slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates, specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients, accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets, yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.

Abstract: Biomedical signals provide insights into various conditions affecting the human body. Beyond diagnostic capabilities, these signals offer a deeper understanding of how specific organs respond to an individual's emotions and feelings. For instance, ECG data can reveal changes in heart rate variability linked to emotional arousal, stress levels, and autonomic nervous system activity. This data offers a window into the physiological basis of our emotional states. Recent advancements in the field diverge from conventional approaches by leveraging the power of advanced transformer architectures, which surpass traditional machine learning and deep learning methods. We begin by assessing the effectiveness of the Vision Transformer (ViT), a forefront model in image classification, for identifying emotions in imaged ECGs. Following this, we present and evaluate an improved version of ViT, integrating both CNN and SE blocks, aiming to bolster performance on imaged ECGs associated with emotion detection. Our method unfolds in two critical phases: first, we apply advanced preprocessing techniques for signal purification and converting signals into interpretable images using continuous wavelet transform and power spectral density analysis; second, we unveil a performance-boosted vision transformer architecture, cleverly enhanced with convolutional neural network components, to adeptly tackle the challenges of emotion recognition. Our methodology's robustness and innovation were thoroughly tested using ECG data from the YAAD and DREAMER datasets, leading to remarkable outcomes. For the YAAD dataset, our approach outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods in classifying seven unique emotional states, as well as in valence and arousal classification. Similarly, in the DREAMER dataset, our method excelled in distinguishing between valence, arousal and dominance, surpassing current leading techniques.

Abstract: Although audio generation has been widely studied over recent years, video-aligned audio generation still remains a relatively unexplored frontier. To address this gap, we introduce StereoSync, a novel and efficient model designed to generate audio that is both temporally synchronized with a reference video and spatially aligned with its visual context. Moreover, StereoSync also achieves efficiency by leveraging pretrained foundation models, reducing the need for extensive training while maintaining high-quality synthesis. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on temporal synchronization, StereoSync introduces a significant advancement by incorporating spatial awareness into video-aligned audio generation. Indeed, given an input video, our approach extracts spatial cues from depth maps and bounding boxes, using them as cross-attention conditioning in a diffusion-based audio generation model. Such an approach allows StereoSync to go beyond simple synchronization, producing stereo audio that dynamically adapts to the spatial structure and movement of a video scene. We evaluate StereoSync on Walking The Maps, a curated dataset comprising videos from video games that feature animated characters walking through diverse environments. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of StereoSync to achieve both temporal and spatial alignment, advancing the state of the art in video-to-audio generation and resulting in a significantly more immersive and realistic audio experience.

Abstract: In this work, we present FoleyGRAM, a novel approach to video-to-audio generation that emphasizes semantic conditioning through the use of aligned multimodal encoders. Building on prior advancements in video-to-audio generation, FoleyGRAM leverages the Gramian Representation Alignment Measure (GRAM) to align embeddings across video, text, and audio modalities, enabling precise semantic control over the audio generation process. The core of FoleyGRAM is a diffusion-based audio synthesis model conditioned on GRAM-aligned embeddings and waveform envelopes, ensuring both semantic richness and temporal alignment with the corresponding input video. We evaluate FoleyGRAM on the Greatest Hits dataset, a standard benchmark for video-to-audio models. Our experiments demonstrate that aligning multimodal encoders using GRAM enhances the system's ability to semantically align generated audio with video content, advancing the state of the art in video-to-audio synthesis.

<title>Towards Robust and Realible Multimodal Fake News Detection with Incomplete Modality</title>

Abstract: Multimodal fake news detection (MFND) has become an urgent task with the emergence of huge multimodal fake content on social media platforms. Previous studies mainly focus on complex feature extraction and fusion to learn discriminative information from multimodal content. However, in real-world applications, multimedia news may naturally lose some information during dissemination, resulting in modality incompleteness, which is detrimental to the generalization and robustness of existing models. To this end, we propose a novel generic and robust multimodal fusion strategy, termed Multi-expert Modality-incomplete Learning Network (MMLNet), which is simple yet effective. It consists of three key steps: (1) Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning to compensate for missing modalities by dynamically leveraging complementary information through multiple experts. (2) Incomplete Modality Adapters compensates for the missing information by leveraging the new feature distribution. (3) Modality Missing Learning leveraging an label-aware adaptive weighting strategy to learn a robust representation with contrastive learning. We evaluate MMLNet on three real-world benchmarks across two languages, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining relative simplicity. By ensuring the accuracy of fake news detection in incomplete modality scenarios caused by information propagation, MMLNet effectively curbs the spread of malicious misinformation. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhyhome/MMLNet.

Abstract: The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret, and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a quantitative evaluation of the results.

Abstract: Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) is a widely used non-invasive optical imaging technology in biomedical research. It usually faces significant accuracy challenges in depth reconstruction, and conventional iterative methods struggle with poor $z$-resolution even with advanced regularization. Supervised learning approaches can improve recovery accuracy but rely on large, high-quality paired training dataset that is often impractical to acquire in practice. This naturally raises the question of how learning-based approaches can be effectively combined with iterative schemes to yield more accurate and stable algorithms. In this work, we present a novel warm-basis iterative projection method (WB-IPM) and establish its theoretical underpinnings. The method is able to achieve significantly more accurate reconstructions than the learning-based and iterative-based methods. In addition, it allows a weaker loss function depending solely on the directional component of the difference between ground truth and neural network output, thereby substantially reducing the training effort. These features are justified by our error analysis as well as simulated and real-data experiments.

<title>Gaussian Embeddings: How JEPAs Secretly Learn Your Data Density</title>

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) learn representations able to solve numerous downstream tasks out-of-the-box. JEPAs combine two objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family (I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

Abstract: The generation of sounding videos has seen significant advancements with the advent of diffusion models. However, existing methods often lack the fine-grained control needed to generate viewpoint-specific content from larger, immersive 360-degree environments. This limitation restricts the creation of audio-visual experiences that are aware of off-camera events. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a framework for controllable audio-visual generation, addressing this unexplored gap. Specifically, we propose a diffusion model by introducing a set of powerful conditioning signals derived from the full 360-degree space: a panoramic saliency map to identify regions of interest, a bounding-box-aware signed distance map to define the target viewpoint, and a descriptive caption of the entire scene. By integrating these controls, our model generates spatially-aware viewpoint videos and audios that are coherently influenced by the broader, unseen environmental context, introducing a strong controllability that is essential for realistic and immersive audio-visual generation. We show audiovisual examples proving the effectiveness of our framework.

Abstract: Smartphone-based iris recognition in the visible spectrum (VIS) remains difficult due to illumination variability, pigmentation differences, and the absence of standardized capture controls. This work presents a compact end-to-end pipeline that enforces ISO/IEC 29794-6 quality compliance at acquisition and demonstrates that accurate VIS iris recognition is feasible on commodity devices. Using a custom Android application performing real-time framing, sharpness evaluation, and feedback, we introduce the CUVIRIS dataset of 752 compliant images from 47 subjects. A lightweight MobileNetV3-based multi-task segmentation network (LightIrisNet) is developed for efficient on-device processing, and a transformer matcher (IrisFormer) is adapted to the VIS domain. Under a standardized protocol and comparative benchmarking against prior CNN baselines, OSIRIS attains a TAR of 97.9% at FAR=0.01 (EER=0.76%), while IrisFormer, trained only on UBIRIS.v2, achieves an EER of 0.057% on CUVIRIS. The acquisition app, trained models, and a public subset of the dataset are released to support reproducibility. These results confirm that standardized capture and VIS-adapted lightweight models enable accurate and practical iris recognition on smartphones.

<title>Overlap-aware segmentation for topological reconstruction of obscured objects</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06194</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: The separation of overlapping objects presents a significant challenge in scientific imaging. While deep learning segmentation-regression algorithms can predict pixel-wise intensities, they typically treat all regions equally rather than prioritizing overlap regions where attribution is most ambiguous. Recent advances in instance segmentation show that weighting regions of pixel overlap in training can improve segmentation boundary predictions in regions of overlap, but this idea has not yet been extended to segmentation regression. We address this with Overlap-Aware Segmentation of ImageS (OASIS): a new segmentation-regression framework with a weighted loss function designed to prioritize regions of object-overlap during training, enabling extraction of pixel intensities and topological features from heavily obscured objects. We demonstrate OASIS in the context of the MIGDAL experiment, which aims to directly image the Migdal effect--a rare process where electron emission is induced by nuclear scattering--in a low-pressure optical time projection chamber. This setting poses an extreme test case, as the target for reconstruction is a faint electron recoil track which is often heavily-buried within the orders-of-magnitude brighter nuclear recoil track. Compared to unweighted training, OASIS improves median intensity reconstruction errors from -32% to -14% for low-energy electron tracks (4-5 keV) and improves topological intersection-over-union scores from 0.828 to 0.855. These performance gains demonstrate OASIS's ability to recover obscured signals in overlap-dominated regions. The framework provides a generalizable methodology for scientific imaging where pixels represent physical quantities and overlap obscures features of interest. All code is openly available to facilitate cross-domain adoption.

Abstract: Some early violins have been reduced during their history to fit imposed morphological standards, while more recent ones have been built directly to these standards. We can observe differences between reduced and unreduced instruments, particularly in their contour lines and channel of minima. In a recent preliminary work, we computed and highlighted those two features for two instruments using triangular 3D meshes acquired by photogrammetry, whose fidelity has been assessed and validated with sub-millimetre accuracy. We propose here an extension to a corpus of 38 violins, violas and cellos, and introduce improved procedures, leading to a stronger discussion of the geometric analysis. We first recall the material we are working with. We then discuss how to derive the best reference plane for the violin alignment, which is crucial for the computation of contour lines and channel of minima. Finally, we show how to compute efficiently both characteristics and we illustrate our results with a few examples.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection presents significant challenges due to the limited intrinsic features of the target and the overwhelming presence of visually similar background distractors. We contend that background semantics are critical for distinguishing between objects that appear visually similar in this context. To address this challenge, we propose a task, clustered infrared small target detection, and introduce DenseSIRST, a benchmark dataset that provides per-pixel semantic annotations for background regions. This dataset facilitates the shift from sparse to dense target detection. This dataset facilitates the shift from sparse to dense target detection. Building on this resource, we propose the Background-Aware Feature Exchange Network (BAFE-Net), a multi-task architecture that jointly tackles target detection and background semantic segmentation. BAFE-Net incorporates a dynamic cross-task feature hard-exchange mechanism, enabling the effective exchange of target and background semantics between the two tasks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BAFE-Net significantly enhances target detection accuracy while mitigating false alarms. The DenseSIRST dataset, along with the code and trained models, is publicly available at https://github.com/GrokCV/BAFE-Net.

Abstract: Mamba, a special case of the State Space Model, is gaining popularity as an alternative to template-based deep learning approaches in medical image analysis. While transformers are powerful architectures, they have drawbacks, including quadratic computational complexity and an inability to address long-range dependencies efficiently. This limitation affects the analysis of large and complex datasets in medical imaging, where there are many spatial and temporal relationships. In contrast, Mamba offers benefits that make it well-suited for medical image analysis. It has linear time complexity, which is a significant improvement over transformers. Mamba processes longer sequences without attention mechanisms, enabling faster inference and requiring less memory. Mamba also demonstrates strong performance in merging multimodal data, improving diagnosis accuracy and patient outcomes. The organization of this paper allows readers to appreciate the capabilities of Mamba in medical imaging step by step. We begin by defining core concepts of SSMs and models, including S4, S5, and S6, followed by an exploration of Mamba architectures such as pure Mamba, U-Net variants, and hybrid models with convolutional neural networks, transformers, and Graph Neural Networks. We also cover Mamba optimizations, techniques and adaptations, scanning, datasets, applications, experimental results, and conclude with its challenges and future directions in medical imaging. This review aims to demonstrate the transformative potential of Mamba in overcoming existing barriers within medical imaging while paving the way for innovative advancements in the field. A comprehensive list of Mamba architectures applied in the medical field, reviewed in this work, is available at Github.

Abstract: Location modeling, or determining where non-existing objects could feasibly appear in a scene, has the potential to benefit numerous computer vision tasks, from automatic object insertion to scene creation in virtual reality. Yet, this capability remains largely unexplored to date. In this paper, we develop a generative location model that, given an object class and an image, learns to predict plausible bounding boxes for such an object. Our approach first tokenizes the image and target object class, then decodes bounding box coordinates through an autoregressive transformer. This formulation effectively addresses two core challenges in locatio modeling: the inherent one-to-many nature of plausible locations, and the sparsity of existing location modeling datasets, where fewer than 1% of valid placements are labeled. Furthermore, we incorporate Direct Preference Optimization to leverage negative labels, refining the spatial predictions. Empirical evaluations reveal that our generative location model achieves superior placement accuracy on the OPA dataset as compared to discriminative baselines and image composition approaches. We further test our model in the context of object insertion, where it proposes locations for an off-the-shelf inpainting model to render objects. In this respect, our proposal exhibits improved visual coherence relative to state-of-the-art instruction-tuned editing methods, demonstrating a high-performing location model's utility in a downstream application.

Abstract: We propose a deep mixture of multimodal hierarchical variational auto-encoders called MMHVAE that synthesizes missing images from observed images in different modalities. MMHVAE's design focuses on tackling four challenges: (i) creating a complex latent representation of multimodal data to generate high-resolution images; (ii) encouraging the variational distributions to estimate the missing information needed for cross-modal image synthesis; (iii) learning to fuse multimodal information in the context of missing data; (iv) leveraging dataset-level information to handle incomplete data sets at training time. Extensive experiments are performed on the challenging problem of pre-operative brain multi-parametric magnetic resonance and intra-operative ultrasound imaging.

Abstract: Lossy compression relies on an autoencoder to transform a point cloud into latent points for storage, leaving the inherent redundancy of latent representations unexplored. To reduce redundancy in latent points, we propose a diffusion-based framework guided by sparse priors that achieves high reconstruction quality, especially at low bitrates. Our approach features an efficient dual-density data flow that relaxes size constraints on latent points. It hybridizes a probabilistic conditional diffusion model to encapsulate essential details for reconstruction within sparse priors, which are decoupled hierarchically into intra- and inter-point priors. Specifically, our DiffCom encodes the original point cloud into latent points and decoupled sparse priors through separate encoders. To dynamically attend to geometric and semantic cues from the priors at each encoding and decoding layer, we employ an attention-guided latent denoiser conditioned on the decoupled priors. Additionally, we integrate the local distribution into the arithmetic encoder and decoder to enhance local context modeling of the sparse points. The original point cloud is reconstructed through a point decoder. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves a superior rate-distortion trade-off, as evidenced by extensive evaluations on the ShapeNet dataset and standard test datasets from the MPEG PCC Group.

Abstract: In the current paradigm of image captioning, deep learning models are trained to generate text from image embeddings of latent features. We challenge the assumption that fine-tuning of large, bespoke models is required to improve model generation accuracy. Here we propose Label Boosted Retrieval Augmented Generation (LaB-RAG), a small-model-based approach to image captioning that leverages image descriptors in the form of categorical labels to boost standard retrieval augmented generation (RAG) with pretrained large language models (LLMs). We study our method in the context of radiology report generation (RRG) over MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus. We argue that simple classification models combined with zero-shot embeddings can effectively transform X-rays into text-space as radiology-specific labels. In combination with standard RAG, we show that these derived text labels can be used with general-domain LLMs to generate radiology reports. Without ever training our generative language model or image embedding models specifically for the task, and without ever directly "showing" the LLM an X-ray, we demonstrate that LaB-RAG achieves better results across natural language and radiology language metrics compared with other retrieval-based RRG methods, while attaining competitive results compared to other fine-tuned vision-language RRG models. We further conduct extensive ablation experiments to better understand the components of LaB-RAG. Our results suggest broader compatibility and synergy with fine-tuned methods to further enhance RRG performance.

Abstract: The remarkable progress in text-to-video diffusion models enables the generation of photorealistic videos, although the content of these generated videos often includes unnatural movement or deformation, reverse playback, and motionless scenes. Recently, an alignment problem has attracted huge attention, where we steer the output of diffusion models based on some measure of the content's goodness. Because there is a large room for improvement of perceptual quality along the frame direction, we should address which metrics we should optimize and how we can optimize them in the video generation. In this paper, we propose diffusion latent beam search with lookahead estimator, which can select a better diffusion latent to maximize a given alignment reward at inference time. We then point out that improving perceptual video quality with respect to alignment to prompts requires reward calibration by weighting existing metrics. This is because when humans or vision language models evaluate outputs, many previous metrics to quantify the naturalness of video do not always correlate with the evaluation. We demonstrate that our method improves the perceptual quality evaluated on the calibrated reward, VLMs, and human assessment, without model parameter update, and outputs the best generation compared to greedy search and best-of-N sampling under much more efficient computational cost. The experiments highlight that our method is beneficial to many capable generative models, and provide a practical guideline: we should prioritize the inference-time compute allocation into enabling the lookahead estimator and increasing the search budget, rather than expanding the denoising steps.

Abstract: Accurate 3D shape representation is essential in engineering applications such as design, optimization, and simulation. In practice, engineering workflows require structured, part-based representations, as objects are inherently designed as assemblies of distinct components. However, most existing methods either model shapes holistically or decompose them without predefined part structures, limiting their applicability in real-world design tasks. We propose PartSDF, a supervised implicit representation framework that explicitly models composite shapes with independent, controllable parts while maintaining shape consistency. Thanks to its simple but innovative architecture, PartSDF outperforms both supervised and unsupervised baselines in reconstruction and generation tasks. We further demonstrate its effectiveness as a structured shape prior for engineering applications, enabling precise control over individual components while preserving overall coherence.

Abstract: Evaluating deformable image registration (DIR) is challenging due to the inherent trade-off between achieving high alignment accuracy and maintaining deformation regularity. However, most existing DIR works either address this trade-off inadequately or overlook it altogether. In this paper, we highlight the issues with existing practices and propose an evaluation scheme that captures the trade-off continuously to holistically evaluate DIR methods. We first introduce the alignment regularity characteristic (ARC) curves, which describe the performance of a given registration method as a spectrum under various degrees of regularity. We demonstrate that the ARC curves reveal unique insights that are not evident from existing evaluation practices, using experiments on representative deep learning DIR methods with various network architectures and transformation models. We further adopt a HyperNetwork based approach that learns to continuously interpolate across the full regularization range, accelerating the construction and improving the sample density of ARC curves. Finally, we provide general guidelines for a nuanced model evaluation and selection using our evaluation scheme for both practitioners and registration researchers.

Abstract: Building on recent advances in Bayesian statistics and image denoising, we propose Noise2Score3D, a fully unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising. Noise2Score3D learns the score function of the underlying point cloud distribution directly from noisy data, eliminating the need for clean data during training. Using Tweedie's formula, our method performs denoising in a single step, avoiding the iterative processes used in existing unsupervised methods, thus improving both accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we introduce Total Variation for Point Clouds as a denoising quality metric, which allows for the estimation of unknown noise parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that Noise2Score3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks among unsupervised learning methods in Chamfer distance and point-to-mesh metrics. Noise2Score3D also demonstrates strong generalization ability beyond training datasets. Our method, by addressing the generalization issue and challenge of the absence of clean data in learning-based methods, paves the way for learning-based point cloud denoising methods in real-world applications.

However, these approaches often overlook semantic relationships between distinct instances, leading to false negatives when semantically similar samples are treated as negatives. This limitation is especially critical in medical imaging domains such as cardiology, where demographic and clinical attributes play a critical role in assessing disease risk and patient outcomes. We introduce a tabular-guided contrastive learning framework that leverages clinically relevant tabular data to identify patient-level similarities and construct more meaningful pairs, enabling semantically aligned representation learning without requiring joint embeddings across modalities. Additionally, we adapt the k-NN algorithm for zero-shot prediction to overcome the lack of zero-shot capability in unimodal representations. We demonstrate the strength of our methods using a large cohort of short-axis cardiac MR images and clinical attributes, where tabular data helps to more effectively distinguish between patient subgroups. Evaluation on downstream tasks, including fine-tuning, linear probing, and zero-shot prediction of cardiovascular artery diseases and cardiac phenotypes, shows that incorporating tabular data guidance yields stronger visual representations than conventional methods that rely solely on image augmentation or combined image-tabular embeddings. Further, we show that our method can generalize to natural images by evaluating it on a car advertisement dataset. The code will be available on GitHub upon acceptance.

Abstract: Background: Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) values and Total Diffusion Volume (TDV) from Whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI (WB-DWI) are recognized cancer imaging biomarkers. However, manual disease delineation for ADC and TDV measurements is unfeasible in clinical practice, demanding automation. As a first step, we propose an algorithm to generate fast and reproducible probability maps of the skeleton, adjacent internal organs (liver, spleen, urinary bladder, and kidneys), and spinal canal. Methods: We developed an automated deep-learning pipeline based on a 3D patch-based Residual U-Net architecture that localises and delineates these anatomical structures on WB-DWI. The algorithm was trained using "soft labels" (non-binary segmentations) derived from a computationally intensive atlas-based approach. For training and validation, we employed a multi-centre WB-DWI dataset comprising 532 scans from patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer (APC) or Multiple Myeloma (MM), with testing on 45 patients. Results: Our weakly-supervised deep learning model achieved an average dice score of 0.67 for whole skeletal delineation, 0.76 when excluding ribcage, 0.83 for internal organs, and 0.86 for spinal canal, with average surface distances below 3mm. Relative median ADC differences between automated and manual full-body delineations were below 10%. The model was 12x faster than the atlas-based registration algorithm (25 sec vs. 5 min). Two experienced radiologists rated the model's outputs as either "good" or "excellent" on test scans, with inter-reader agreement from fair to substantial (Gwet's AC1 = 0.27-0.72). Conclusion: The model offers fast, reproducible probability maps for localising and delineating body regions on WB-DWI, potentially enabling non-invasive imaging biomarker quantification to support disease staging and treatment response assessment.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce long-video masked-embedding autoencoders (LV-MAE), a self-supervised learning framework for long video representation. Our approach treats short- and long-span dependencies as two separate tasks. Such decoupling allows for a more intuitive video processing where short-span spatiotemporal primitives are first encoded and are then used to capture long-range dependencies across consecutive video segments. To achieve this, we leverage advanced off-the-shelf multimodal encoders to extract representations from short segments within the long video, followed by pre-training a masked-embedding autoencoder capturing high-level interactions across segments. LV-MAE is highly efficient to train and enables the processing of much longer videos by alleviating the constraint on the number of input frames. Furthermore, unlike existing methods that typically pre-train on short-video datasets, our approach offers self-supervised pre-training using long video samples (e.g., 20+ minutes video clips) at scale. Using LV-MAE representations, we achieve state-of-the-art results on three long-video benchmarks -- LVU, COIN, and Breakfast -- employing only a simple classification head for either attentive or linear probing. Finally, to assess LV-MAE pre-training and visualize its reconstruction quality, we leverage the video-language aligned space of short video representations to monitor LV-MAE through video-text retrieval.

Abstract: This is the preprint version of the article published in IEEE Access vol. 13, pp. 146503--146526, 2025, doi:10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3599541. Please cite the published version.
  Urban air pollution remains a pressing global concern, particularly in densely populated and traffic-intensive metropolitan areas like Delhi, where exposure to harmful pollutants severely impacts public health. Delhi, being one of the most polluted cities globally, experiences chronic air quality issues due to vehicular emissions, industrial activities, and construction dust, which exacerbate its already fragile atmospheric conditions. Traditional pollution mitigation strategies, such as static air purifying installations, often fail to maximize their impact due to suboptimal placement and limited adaptability to dynamic urban environments. This study presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to optimize the placement of air purification booths to improve the air quality index (AQI) in the city of Delhi. We employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithm, to iteratively learn and identify high-impact locations based on multiple spatial and environmental factors, including population density, traffic patterns, industrial influence, and green space constraints. Our approach is benchmarked against conventional placement strategies, including random and greedy AQI-based methods, using multi-dimensional performance evaluation metrics such as AQI improvement, spatial coverage, population and traffic impact, and spatial entropy.

Abstract: Omni-domain infrared small target detection (Omni-IRSTD) poses formidable challenges, as a single model must seamlessly adapt to diverse imaging systems, varying resolutions, and multiple spectral bands simultaneously. Current approaches predominantly rely on visual-only modeling paradigms that not only struggle with complex background interference and inherently scarce target features, but also exhibit limited generalization capabilities across complex omni-scene environments where significant domain shifts and appearance variations occur. In this work, we reveal a critical oversight in existing paradigms: the neglect of readily available auxiliary metadata describing imaging parameters and acquisition conditions, such as spectral bands, sensor platforms, resolution, and observation perspectives. To address this limitation, we propose the Auxiliary Metadata Driven Infrared Small Target Detector (AuxDet), a novel multimodal framework that is the first to incorporate metadata into the IRSTD paradigm for scene-aware optimization. Through a high-dimensional fusion module based on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), AuxDet dynamically integrates metadata semantics with visual features, guiding adaptive representation learning for each individual sample. Additionally, we design a lightweight prior-initialized enhancement module using 1D convolutional blocks to further refine fused features and recover fine-grained target cues. Extensive experiments on the challenging WideIRSTD-Full benchmark demonstrate that AuxDet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the critical role of auxiliary information in improving robustness and accuracy in omni-domain IRSTD tasks.

Abstract: Foundation models have ushered in a new era for multimodal video understanding by enabling the extraction of rich spatiotemporal and semantic representations. In this work, we introduce a novel graph-based framework that integrates a vision-language foundation, leveraging VideoMAE for dynamic visual encoding and BERT for contextual textual embedding, to address the challenge of recognizing fine-grained bimanual manipulation actions. Departing from conventional static graph architectures, our approach constructs an adaptive multimodal graph where nodes represent frames, objects, and textual annotations, and edges encode spatial, temporal, and semantic relationships. These graph structures evolve dynamically based on learned interactions, allowing for flexible and context-aware reasoning. A task-specific attention mechanism within a Graph Attention Network further enhances this reasoning by modulating edge importance based on action semantics. Through extensive evaluations on diverse benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the strength of combining foundation models with dynamic graph-based reasoning for robust and generalizable action recognition.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) are essential for video generation but suffer from significant latency due to the quadratic complexity of attention. By computing only critical tokens, sparse attention reduces computational costs and offers a promising acceleration approach. However, we identify that existing methods fail to approach optimal generation quality under the same computation budget for two reasons: (1) Inaccurate critical token identification: current methods cluster tokens based on position rather than semantics, leading to imprecise aggregated representations. (2) Excessive computation waste: critical tokens are scattered among non-critical ones, leading to wasted computation on GPUs, which are optimized for processing contiguous tokens. In this paper, we propose SVG2, a training-free framework that maximizes identification accuracy and minimizes computation waste, achieving a Pareto frontier trade-off between generation quality and efficiency. The core of SVG2 is semantic-aware permutation, which clusters and reorders tokens based on semantic similarity using k-means. This approach ensures both a precise cluster representation, improving identification accuracy, and a densified layout of critical tokens, enabling efficient computation without padding. Additionally, SVG2 integrates top-p dynamic budget control and customized kernel implementations, achieving up to 2.30x and 1.89x speedup while maintaining a PSNR of up to 30 and 26 on HunyuanVideo and Wan 2.1, respectively.

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval (T2I retrieval) remains challenging because cross-modal embeddings often behave as bags of concepts and underrepresent structured visual relationships such as pose and viewpoint. We propose Visualize-then-Retrieve (VisRet), a new paradigm for T2I retrieval that mitigates this limitation of cross-modal similarity alignment. VisRet first projects textual queries into the image modality via T2I generation. Then, it performs retrieval within the image modality to bypass the weaknesses of cross-modal retrievers in recognizing subtle visual-spatial features. Across four benchmarks (Visual-RAG, INQUIRE-Rerank, Microsoft COCO, and our new Visual-RAG-ME featuring multi-entity comparisons), VisRet substantially outperforms cross-modal similarity matching and baselines that recast T2I retrieval as text-to-text similarity matching, improving nDCG@30 by 0.125 on average with CLIP as the retriever and by 0.121 with E5-V. For downstream question answering, VisRet increases accuracy on Visual-RAG and Visual-RAG-ME by 3.8% and 15.7% in top-1 retrieval, and by 3.9% and 11.1% in top-10 retrieval. Ablation studies show compatibility with different T2I instruction LLMs, T2I generation models, and downstream LLMs. VisRet provides a practical and principled path that energizes further advances in vision-language retrieval. Our code and the Visual-RAG-ME benchmark will be publicly released.

Abstract: Recent video diffusion models have demonstrated their great capability in generating visually-pleasing results, while synthesizing the correct physical effects in generated videos remains challenging. The complexity of real-world motions, interactions, and dynamics introduce great difficulties when learning physics from data. In this work, we propose DiffPhy, a generic framework that enables physically-correct and photo-realistic video generation by fine-tuning a pre-trained video diffusion model. Our method leverages large language models (LLMs) to infer rich physical context from the text prompt. To incorporate this context into the video diffusion model, we use a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to verify intermediate latent variables against the inferred physical rules, guiding the gradient updates of model accordingly. Textual output of LLM is transformed into continuous signals. We then formulate a set of training objectives that jointly ensure physical accuracy and semantic alignment with the input text. Additionally, failure facts of physical phenomena are corrected via attention injection. We also establish a high-quality physical video dataset containing diverse phyiscal actions and events to facilitate effective finetuning. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that DiffPhy is able to produce state-of-the-art results across diverse physics-related scenarios.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction from in-the-wild images remains a challenging task due to inconsistent lighting conditions and transient distractors. Existing methods typically rely on heuristic strategies to handle the low-quality training data, which often struggle to produce stable and consistent reconstructions, frequently resulting in visual artifacts.In this work, we propose \modelname{}, a novel framework that leverages the stochastic nature of these artifacts: they tend to vary across different training runs due to minor randomness. Specifically, our method trains two 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models in parallel, enforcing a consistency constraint that encourages convergence on reliable scene geometry while suppressing inconsistent artifacts. To prevent the two models from collapsing into similar failure modes due to confirmation bias, we introduce a divergent masking strategy that applies two complementary masks: a multi-cue adaptive mask and a self-supervised soft mask, which leads to an asymmetric training process of the two models, reducing shared error modes. In addition, to improve the efficiency of model training, we introduce a lightweight variant called Dynamic EMA Proxy, which replaces one of the two models with a dynamically updated Exponential Moving Average (EMA) proxy, and employs an alternating masking strategy to preserve divergence. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches while achieving high efficiency.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved impressive progress in visual perception and reasoning. However, when confronted with visually ambiguous or non-semantic scene text, they often struggle to accurately spot and understand the content, frequently generating semantically plausible yet visually incorrect answers, which we refer to as semantic hallucination. In this work, we investigate the underlying causes of semantic hallucination and identify a key finding: Transformer layers in LLM with stronger attention focus on scene text regions are less prone to producing semantic hallucinations. Thus, we propose a training-free semantic hallucination mitigation framework comprising two key components: (1) ZoomText, a coarse-to-fine strategy that identifies potential text regions without external detectors; and (2) Grounded Layer Correction, which adaptively leverages the internal representations from layers less prone to hallucination to guide decoding, correcting hallucinated outputs for non-semantic samples while preserving the semantics of meaningful ones. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce TextHalu-Bench, a benchmark of 1,740 samples spanning both semantic and non-semantic cases, with manually curated question answer pairs designed to probe model hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates semantic hallucination but also achieves strong performance on public benchmarks for scene text spotting and understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in various multimodal tasks. To pursue higher intelligence in space, MLLMs require integrating multiple spatial capabilities, even for handling simple and normal tasks. However, existing benchmarks struggle to comprehensively evaluate the spatial intelligence of common MLLMs from the atomic level to the compositional level. To fill this gap, we present SpaCE-10, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional spatial evaluations. In SpaCE-10, we define 10 atomic spatial capabilities, which are combined to form 8 compositional capabilities. Based on these definitions, we propose a novel hierarchical annotation pipeline to generate high-quality and diverse question-answer (QA) pairs. With over 150+ hours of human expert effort, we obtain over 5k QA pairs for 811 real indoor scenes in SpaCE-10, which covers various evaluation settings like point cloud input and multi-choice QA. We conduct an extensive evaluation of common MLLMs on SpaCE-10 and find that even the most advanced MLLM still lags behind humans by large margins. Through our careful study, we also draw several significant findings that benefit the MLLM community. For example, we reveal that the shortcoming of counting capability greatly limits the compositional spatial capabilities of existing MLLMs.

Abstract: We propose a step-by-step video-to-audio (V2A) generation method for finer controllability over the generation process and more realistic audio synthesis. Inspired by traditional Foley workflows, our approach aims to comprehensively capture all sound events induced by a video through the incremental generation of missing sound events. To avoid the need for costly multi-reference video-audio datasets, each generation step is formulated as a negatively guided V2A process that discourages duplication of existing sounds. The guidance model is trained by finetuning a pre-trained V2A model on audio pairs from adjacent segments of the same video, allowing training with standard single-reference audiovisual datasets that are easily accessible. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our method enhances the separability of generated sounds at each step and improves the overall quality of the final composite audio, outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Higher-order tensors are well-suited for representing multi-dimensional data, such as images and videos, which typically characterize low-rank structures. Low-rank tensor decomposition has become essential in machine learning and computer vision, but existing methods like Tucker decomposition offer flexibility at the expense of interpretability. The CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition provides a natural and interpretable structure, while obtaining a sparse solutions remains challenging. Leveraging the rich properties of CP decomposition, we propose a CP-based low-rank tensor function parameterized by neural networks (NN) for implicit neural representation. This approach can model the tensor both on-grid and beyond grid, fully utilizing the non-linearity of NN with theoretical guarantees on excess risk bounds. To achieve sparser CP decomposition, we introduce a variational Schatten-p quasi-norm to prune redundant rank-1 components and prove that it serves as a common upper bound for the Schatten-p quasi-norms of arbitrary unfolding matrices. For smoothness, we propose a regularization term based on the spectral norm of the Jacobian and Hutchinson's trace estimator. The proposed smoothness regularization is SVD-free and avoids explicit chain rule derivations. It can serve as an alternative to Total Variation (TV) regularization in image denoising tasks and is naturally applicable to implicit neural representation. Extensive experiments on multi-dimensional data recovery tasks, including image inpainting, denoising, and point cloud upsampling, demonstrate the superiority and versatility of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have made impressive strides in understanding video content, but they often struggle with abstract and adaptive reasoning-the ability to revise their interpretations when new information emerges. In reality, conclusions are rarely set in stone; additional context can strengthen or weaken an initial inference. To address this, we introduce Defeasible Video Entailment (DVidE), a new task that challenges models to think like doubters, constantly updating their reasoning based on evolving evidence. In DVidE, given a video premise and a textual hypothesis, models must determine whether a new update strengthens or weakens the hypothesis (classification version) or generate a coherent update that modifies the entailment relationship (generation version). For solving the classification task, we propose the Chain of Counterfactual Thought framework, utilizing counterfactual reasoning, ASR-enhanced video content, and rationale refinement to reduce inference bias. For the generation task, we develop a framework that combines ASR output with a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce coherent, contextually relevant updates aligned with the intended strengthener or weakener goals. Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset, with strengthener/weakener annotations and an LLM-based evaluation metric specifically designed for assessing generative performance. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements, highlighting our proposed method in enhancing dynamic reasoning capabilities of VLMMs.

Abstract: Image deblurring, removing blurring artifacts from images, is a fundamental task in computational photography and low-level computer vision. Existing approaches focus on specialized solutions tailored to particular blur types, thus, these solutions lack generalization. This limitation in current methods implies requiring multiple models to cover several blur types, which is not practical in many real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first all-in-one deblurring method capable of efficiently restoring images affected by diverse blur degradations, including global motion, local motion, blur in low-light conditions, and defocus blur. We propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE) decoding module, which dynamically routes image features based on the recognized blur degradation, enabling precise and efficient restoration in an end-to-end manner. Our unified approach not only achieves performance comparable to dedicated task-specific models, but also shows promising generalization to unseen blur scenarios, particularly when leveraging appropriate expert selection.

Abstract: Creating ultra-high-resolution spatially varying bidirectional reflectance functions (SVBRDFs) is critical for photorealistic 3D content creation, to faithfully represent fine-scale surface details required for close-up rendering. However, achieving 4K generation faces two key challenges: (1) the need to synthesize multiple reflectance maps at full resolution, which multiplies the pixel budget and imposes prohibitive memory and computational cost, and (2) the requirement to maintain strong pixel-level alignment across maps at 4K, which is particularly difficult when adapting pretrained models designed for the RGB image domain. We introduce HiMat, a diffusion-based framework tailored for efficient and diverse 4K SVBRDF generation. To address the first challenge, HiMat performs generation in a high-compression latent space via DC-AE, and employs a pretrained diffusion transformer with linear attention to improve per-map efficiency. To address the second challenge, we propose CrossStitch, a lightweight convolutional module that enforces cross-map consistency without incurring the cost of global attention. Our experiments show that HiMat achieves high-fidelity 4K SVBRDF generation with superior efficiency, structural consistency, and diversity compared to prior methods. Beyond materials, our framework also generalizes to related applications such as intrinsic decomposition.

<title>Bridging Semantic Logic Gaps: A Cognition Inspired Multimodal Boundary Preserving Network for Image Manipulation Localization</title>

Abstract: The existing image manipulation localization (IML) models mainly relies on visual cues, but ignores the semantic logical relationships between content features. In fact, the content semantics conveyed by real images often conform to human cognitive laws. However, image manipulation technology usually destroys the internal relationship between content features, thus leaving semantic clues for IML. In this paper, we propose a cognition inspired multimodal boundary preserving network (CMB-Net). Specifically, CMB-Net utilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze manipulated regions within images and generate prompt-based textual information to compensate for the lack of semantic relationships in the visual information. Considering that the erroneous texts induced by hallucination from LLMs will damage the accuracy of IML, we propose an image-text central ambiguity module (ITCAM). It assigns weights to the text features by quantifying the ambiguity between text and image features, thereby ensuring the beneficial impact of textual information. We also propose an image-text interaction module (ITIM) that aligns visual and text features using a correlation matrix for fine-grained interaction. Finally, inspired by invertible neural networks, we propose a restoration edge decoder (RED) that mutually generates input and output features to preserve boundary information in manipulated regions without loss.

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: While multi-step diffusion models have advanced both forward and inverse rendering, existing approaches often treat these problems independently, leading to cycle inconsistency and slow inference speed. In this work, we present Ouroboros, a framework composed of two single-step diffusion models that handle forward and inverse rendering with mutual reinforcement. Our approach extends intrinsic decomposition to both indoor and outdoor scenes and introduces a cycle consistency mechanism that ensures coherence between forward and inverse rendering outputs. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes while achieving substantially faster inference speed compared to other diffusion-based methods. We also demonstrate that Ouroboros can transfer to video decomposition in a training-free manner, reducing temporal inconsistency in video sequences while maintaining high-quality per-frame inverse rendering.

Abstract: Visual prompt-based methods have seen growing interest in incremental learning (IL) for image classification. These approaches learn additional embedding vectors while keeping the model frozen, making them efficient to train. However, no prior work has applied such methods to incremental object detection (IOD), leaving their generalizability unclear. In this paper, we analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based IL in IOD.

Abstract: Existing video generation models predominantly emphasize appearance fidelity while exhibiting limited ability to synthesize complex human motions, such as whole-body movements, long-range dynamics, and fine-grained human-environment interactions. This often leads to unrealistic or physically implausible movements with inadequate structural coherence. To conquer these challenges, we propose MoSA, which decouples the process of human video generation into two components, i.e., structure generation and appearance generation. MoSA first employs a 3D structure transformer to generate a human motion sequence from the text prompt. The remaining video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of this structural sequence. We achieve fine-grained control over the sparse human structures by introducing Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules with a dense tracking constraint during training. The modeling of human-environment interactions is improved through the proposed contact constraint. Those two components work comprehensively to ensure the structural and appearance fidelity across the generated videos. This paper also contributes a large-scale human video dataset, which features more complex and diverse motions than existing human video datasets. We conduct comprehensive comparisons between MoSA and a variety of approaches, including general video generation models, human video generation models, and human animation models. Experiments demonstrate that MoSA substantially outperforms existing approaches across the majority of evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, these models often infer and reveal sensitive biometric attributes such as race, gender, age, body weight, and eye color; even when such information is not explicitly requested. This raises critical concerns, particularly in real-world applications and socially-sensitive domains. Despite increasing awareness, no publicly available dataset or benchmark exists to comprehensively evaluate or mitigate biometric leakage in MLLMs. To address this gap, we introduce PRISM (Privacy-aware Evaluation of Responses in Sensitive Modalities), a new benchmark designed to assess MLLMs on two fronts: (1) refuse biometric-related queries and (2) implicit biometric leakage in general responses while maintaining semantic faithfulness. Further, we conduct a detailed audit of the widely used LLaVA datasets and uncover extensive biometric leakage across pretraining and instruction data. To address this, we present Safe-LLaVA dataset, the first privacy-preserving MLLM training dataset constructed by systematically removing explicit and implicit biometric information from LLaVA dataset. Our evaluations on PRISM reveal biometric leakages across MLLMs for different attributes, highlighting the detailed privacy-violations. We also fine-tune a model on Safe-LLaVA dataset and show that it substantially reduces the biometric leakages. Together, Safe-LLaVA and PRISM set a new standard for privacy-aligned development and evaluation of MLLMs.

Abstract: Fitness movement recognition, a focused subdomain of human activity recognition (HAR), plays a vital role in health monitoring, rehabilitation, and personalized fitness training by enabling automated exercise classification from video data. However, many existing deep learning approaches rely on computationally intensive 3D models, limiting their feasibility in real-time or resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we present a lightweight and effective framework that integrates pre-trained 2D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) such as ResNet50, EfficientNet, and Vision Transformers (ViT) with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network enhanced by spatial attention. These models efficiently extract spatial features while the LSTM captures temporal dependencies, and the attention mechanism emphasizes informative segments. We evaluate the framework on a curated subset of the UCF101 dataset, achieving a peak accuracy of 93.34\% with the ResNet50-based configuration. Comparative results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over several state-of-the-art HAR systems. The proposed method offers a scalable and real-time-capable solution for fitness activity recognition with broader applications in vision-based health and activity monitoring.

Abstract: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR) objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal generation, editing, and understanding.

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, pose a growing threat to information integrity, particularly in politically sensitive contexts. This challenge is amplified by the increasing realism of modern generative models, which our human perception study confirms are often indistinguishable from real images. Yet, existing deepfake detection benchmarks rely on outdated generators or narrowly scoped datasets (e.g., single-face imagery), limiting their utility for real-world detection. To address these gaps, we present OpenFake, a large politically grounded dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking against modern generative models with high realism, and designed to remain extensible through an innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform that continually integrates new hard examples. OpenFake comprises nearly four million total images: three million real images paired with descriptive captions and almost one million synthetic counterparts from state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models. Detectors trained on OpenFake achieve near-perfect in-distribution performance, strong generalization to unseen generators, and high accuracy on a curated in-the-wild social media test set, significantly outperforming models trained on existing datasets. Overall, we demonstrate that with high-quality and continually updated benchmarks, automatic deepfake detection is both feasible and effective in real-world settings.

<title>Robust Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models: A Theoretical Perspective on Security and Robustness</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation but pose increasing risks in terms of privacy, fairness, and security. A growing demand exists to \emph{erase} sensitive or harmful concepts (e.g., NSFW content, private individuals, artistic styles) from these models while preserving their overall generative capabilities. We introduce \textbf{SCORE} (Secure and Concept-Oriented Robust Erasure), a novel framework for robust concept removal in diffusion models. SCORE formulates concept erasure as an \emph{adversarial independence} problem, theoretically guaranteeing that the model's outputs become statistically independent of the erased concept. Unlike prior heuristic methods, SCORE minimizes the mutual information between a target concept and generated outputs, yielding provable erasure guarantees. We provide formal proofs establishing convergence properties and derive upper bounds on residual concept leakage. Empirically, we evaluate SCORE on Stable Diffusion and FLUX across four challenging benchmarks: object erasure, NSFW removal, celebrity face suppression, and artistic style unlearning. SCORE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods including EraseAnything, ANT, MACE, ESD, and UCE, achieving up to \textbf{12.5\%} higher erasure efficacy while maintaining comparable or superior image quality. By integrating adversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven fine-tuning, SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have revolutionized text-guided image editing, yet existing editing methods face critical challenges in hyperparameter identification. To get the reasonable editing performance, these methods often require the user to brute-force tune multiple interdependent hyperparameters, such as inversion timesteps and attention modification. This process incurs high computational costs due to the huge hyperparameter search space. We consider searching optimal editing's hyperparameters as a sequential decision-making task within the diffusion denoising process. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning framework, which establishes a Markov Decision Process that dynamically adjusts hyperparameters across denoising steps, integrating editing objectives into a reward function. The method achieves time efficiency through proximal policy optimization while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations. Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in search time and computational overhead compared to existing brute-force approaches, advancing the practical deployment of a diffusion-based image editing framework in the real world.

<title>GeoRemover: Removing Objects and Their Causal Visual Artifacts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Towards intelligent image editing, object removal should eliminate both the target object and its causal visual artifacts, such as shadows and reflections. However, existing image appearance-based methods either follow strictly mask-aligned training and fail to remove these causal effects which are not explicitly masked, or adopt loosely mask-aligned strategies that lack controllability and may unintentionally over-erase other objects. We identify that these limitations stem from ignoring the causal relationship between an object's geometry presence and its visual effects. To address this limitation, we propose a geometry-aware two-stage framework that decouples object removal into (1) geometry removal and (2) appearance rendering. In the first stage, we remove the object directly from the geometry (e.g., depth) using strictly mask-aligned supervision, enabling structure-aware editing with strong geometric constraints. In the second stage, we render a photorealistic RGB image conditioned on the updated geometry, where causal visual effects are considered implicitly as a result of the modified 3D geometry. To guide learning in the geometry removal stage, we introduce a preference-driven objective based on positive and negative sample pairs, encouraging the model to remove objects as well as their causal visual artifacts while avoiding new structural insertions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing both objects and their associated artifacts on two popular benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/buxiangzhiren/GeoRemover.

Abstract: The hypothesis that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are inherently texture-biased has shaped much of the discourse on feature use in deep learning. We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the cue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance on texture.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language reasoning but often struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise localization and robustness. We propose a reinforcement learning framework that augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum-based data scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering. This approach stabilizes optimization under sparse, noisy rewards and enables progressive adaptation to complex samples. Evaluations on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies confirm the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum pacing for convergence stability and generalization. Our findings highlight reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula as a scalable path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views presents a formidable challenge in 3D reconstruction, where limited multi-view constraints lead to severe overfitting, geometric distortion, and fragmented scenes. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers real-time, high-fidelity rendering, its performance drastically deteriorates under sparse inputs, plagued by floating artifacts and structural failures. To address these challenges, we introduce HBSplat, a unified framework that elevates 3DGS by seamlessly integrating robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region completion. Our core contributions are threefold: a Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that ensures multi-view consistency by leveraging dense matching priors and integrating reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method that enforces substantially stronger constraints by creating high-fidelity virtual views through bidirectional depth-image warping and multi-view fusion; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that recovers occluded areas using a depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model. Extensive evaluations on LLFF, Blender, and DTU benchmarks validate that HBSplat sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR and 0.189 LPIPS, while maintaining real-time inference.

Abstract: Purpose: To improve the generalization ability of deep learning based predictions of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) from high-pass filtered phase (HPFP) data. Methods: A network fine-tuning step called HP-FINE is proposed, which is based on the high-pass filtering forward model with low-frequency preservation regularization. Several comparisons were conducted: 1. HP-FINE with and without low-frequency regularization, 2. three 3D network architectures (Unet, Progressive Unet, and Big Unet), 3. two types of network output (recovered field and susceptibility), and 4. pre-training with and without the filtering augmentation. HPFP datasets with diverse high-pass filters, another acquisition voxel size, and prospective acquisition were used to assess the accuracy of QSM predictions. In the retrospective datasets, quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, RMSE and HFEN) were used for evaluation. In the prospective dataset, statistics of ROI linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis were used for evaluation. Results: In the retrospective datasets, adding low-frequency regularization in HP-FINE substantially improved prediction accuracy compared to the pre-trained results, especially when combined with the filtering augmentation and recovered field output. In the prospective datasets, HP-FINE with low-frequency regularization and recovered field output demonstrated the preservation of ROI values, a result that was not achieved when using susceptibility as the output. Furthermore, Progressive Unet pre-trained with a combination of multiple losses outperformed both Unet and Progressive Unet pre-trained with a single loss in terms of preserving ROI values.

Abstract: Background: Rim+ lesions in multiple sclerosis (MS), detectable via Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), correlate with increased disability. Existing literature lacks quantitative analysis of these lesions. We introduce RimSet for quantitative identification and characterization of rim+ lesions on QSM. Methods: RimSet combines RimSeg, an unsupervised segmentation method using level-set methodology, and radiomic measurements with Local Binary Pattern texture descriptors. We validated RimSet using simulated QSM images and an in vivo dataset of 172 MS subjects with 177 rim+ and 3986 rim-lesions. Results: RimSeg achieved a 78.7% Dice score against the ground truth, with challenges in partial rim lesions. RimSet detected rim+ lesions with a partial ROC AUC of 0.808 and PR AUC of 0.737, surpassing existing methods. QSMRim-Net showed the lowest mean square error (0.85) and high correlation (0.91; 95% CI: 0.88, 0.93) with expert annotations at the subject level.

Abstract: The majority of the recent iterative approaches in 4DCT not only rely on nested iterations, thereby increasing computational complexity and constraining potential acceleration, but also fail to provide a theoretical proof of convergence for their proposed iterative schemes. On the other hand, the latest MATLAB and Python image processing toolboxes lack the implementation of analytic adjoints of affine motion operators for 3D object volumes, which does not allow gradient methods using exact derivatives towards affine motion parameters. In this work, we propose the Simultaneous Affine Motion-Compensated Image Reconstruction Technique (SAMCIRT)- an efficient iterative reconstruction scheme that combines image reconstruction and affine motion estimation in a single update step, based on the analytic adjoints of the motion operators then exact partial derivatives with respect to both the reconstruction and the affine motion parameters. Moreover, we prove the separated Lipschitz continuity of the objective function and its associated functions, including the gradient, which supports the convergence of our proposed iterative scheme, despite the non-convexity of the objective function with respect to the affine motion parameters. Results from simulation and real experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art CT reconstruction with affine motion correction methods in computational feasibility and projection distance. In particular, this allows accurate reconstruction for a real, nonstationary diamond, showing a novel application of 4DCT.

Abstract: A unified representation space in multi-modal learning is essential for effectively integrating diverse data sources, such as text, images, and audio, to enhance efficiency and performance across various downstream tasks. Recent binding methods, such as ImageBind, typically rely on a single, fixed anchor modality for aligning multi-modal data. We mathematically analyze these fixed anchor binding methods and uncover significant limitations: (1) over-reliance on the choice of the anchor modality, (2) inadequate capture of intra-modal information, and (3) failure to account for cross-modal correlation among non-anchored modalities. To address these issues, we propose the need for adaptive anchor binding methods, exemplified by our framework CentroBind. The proposed method uses adaptively adjustable centroid-based anchors generated from all available modalities, leading to a balanced and rich representation space. We theoretically demonstrate that our approach captures three critical properties of multi-modal learning -- intra-modal learning, inter-modal learning, and multi-modal alignment -- while constructing a unified representation that spans all modalities. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that adaptive anchor methods such as CentroBind consistently outperform fixed anchor binding methods, verifying our analysis.

Abstract: Recently, self-supervised representation learning relying on vast amounts of unlabeled data has been explored as a pre-training method for autonomous driving. However, directly applying popular contrastive or generative methods to this problem is insufficient and may even lead to negative transfer. In this paper, we present AD-L-JEPA, a novel self-supervised pre-training framework with a joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) for automotive LiDAR object detection. Unlike existing methods, AD-L-JEPA is neither generative nor contrastive. Instead of explicitly generating masked regions, our method predicts Bird's-Eye-View embeddings to capture the diverse nature of driving scenes. Furthermore, our approach eliminates the need to manually form contrastive pairs by employing explicit variance regularization to avoid representation collapse. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements on the LiDAR 3D object detection downstream task across the KITTI3D, Waymo, and ONCE datasets, while reducing GPU hours by 1.9x-2.7x and GPU memory by 2.8x-4x compared with the state-of-the-art method Occupancy-MAE. Notably, on the largest ONCE dataset, pre-training on 100K frames yields a 1.61 mAP gain, better than all other methods pre-trained on either 100K or 500K frames, and pre-training on 500K frames yields a 2.98 mAP gain, better than all other methods pre-trained on either 500K or 1M frames. AD-L-JEPA constitutes the first JEPA-based pre-training method for autonomous driving. It offers better quality, faster, and more GPU-memory-efficient self-supervised representation learning. The source code of AD-L-JEPA is ready to be released.

Abstract: As large language models expand beyond natural language to domains such as mathematics, multimodal understanding, and embodied agents, tokens increasingly reflect metric relationships rather than purely linguistic meaning. We introduce DIST2Loss, a distance-aware framework designed to train autoregressive discrete models by leveraging predefined distance relationships among output tokens. At its core, DIST2Loss transforms continuous exponential family distributions derived from inherent distance metrics into discrete, categorical optimization targets compatible with the models' architectures. This approach enables the models to learn and preserve meaningful distance relationships during token generation while maintaining compatibility with existing architectures. Empirical evaluations show consistent performance gains in diverse multimodal applications, including visual grounding, robotic manipulation, generative reward modeling, and image generation using vector-quantized features. These improvements are most notable in low-data regimes, demonstrating DIST2Loss's strength under resource constraints.

<title>Optimal Transport for Brain-Image Alignment: Unveiling Redundancy and Synergy in Neural Information Processing</title>

Abstract: The design of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is inspired by the structure of the human brain, and in turn, ANNs offer a potential means to interpret and understand brain signals. Existing methods primarily align brain signals with stimulus signals using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which focuses only on local point-wise alignment and ignores global matching, leading to coarse interpretations and inaccuracies in brain signal decoding.
  In this paper, we address these issues through optimal transport (OT) and theoretically demonstrate why OT provides a more effective alignment strategy than MSE. Specifically, we construct a transport plan between brain voxel embeddings and image embeddings, enabling more precise matching. By controlling the amount of transport, we mitigate the influence of redundant information. We apply our alignment model directly to the Brain Captioning task by feeding brain signals into a large language model (LLM) instead of images. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across ten evaluation metrics, surpassing the previous best method by an average of 6.11\% in single-subject training and 3.81\% in cross-subject training. Additionally, we have uncovered several insightful conclusions that align with existing brain research. We unveil the redundancy and synergy of brain information processing through region masking and data dimensionality reduction visualization experiments. We believe our approach paves the way for a more precise understanding of brain signals in the future. The code is available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/OT-Alignment4brain-to-image.

Abstract: The histopathological analysis of whole-slide images (WSIs) is fundamental to cancer diagnosis but is a time-consuming and expert-driven process. While deep learning methods show promising results, dominant patch-based methods artificially fragment tissue, ignore biological boundaries, and produce black-box predictions. We overcome these limitations with a novel framework that transforms gigapixel WSIs into biologically-informed graph representations and is interpretable by design. Our approach builds graph nodes from tissue regions that respect natural structures, not arbitrary grids. We introduce an adaptive graph coarsening technique, guided by learned embeddings, to efficiently merge homogeneous regions while preserving diagnostically critical details in heterogeneous areas. Each node is enriched with a compact, interpretable feature set capturing clinically-motivated priors. A graph attention network then performs diagnosis on this compact representation. We demonstrate strong performance on challenging cancer staging and survival prediction tasks. Crucially, our resource-efficient model ($>$13x fewer parameters and $>$300x less data) achieves results competitive with a massive foundation model, while offering full interpretability through feature attribution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/HistoGraph31/pix2pathology.

<title>Submillimeter-Accurate 3D Lumbar Spine Reconstruction from Biplanar X-Ray Images: Incorporating a Multi-Task Network and Landmark-Weighted Loss</title>

Abstract: To meet the clinical demand for accurate 3D lumbar spine assessment in a weight-bearing position, this study presents a novel, fully automatic framework for high-precision 3D reconstruction from biplanar X-ray images, overcoming the limitations of existing methods. The core of this method involves a novel multi-task deep learning network that simultaneously performs lumbar decomposition and landmark detection on the original biplanar radiographs. The decomposition effectively eliminates interference from surrounding tissues, simplifying subsequent image registration, while the landmark detection provides an initial pose estimation for the Statistical Shape Model (SSM), enhancing the efficiency and robustness of the registration process. Building on this, we introduce a landmark-weighted 2D-3D registration strategy. By assigning higher weights to complex posterior structures like the transverse and spinous processes during optimization, this strategy significantly enhances the reconstruction accuracy of the posterior arch. Our method was validated against a gold standard derived from registering CT segmentations to the biplanar X-rays. It sets a new benchmark by achieving sub-millimeter accuracy and completes the full reconstruction and measurement workflow in under 20 seconds, establishing a state-of-the-art combination of precision and speed. This fast and low-dose pipeline provides a powerful automated tool for diagnosing lumbar conditions such as spondylolisthesis and scoliosis in their functional, weight-bearing state.

<title>The Mirage of Performance Gains: Why Contrastive Decoding Fails to Mitigate Object Hallucinations in MLLMs?</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10020</link>

Abstract: Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to reduce object hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). These methods work by constructing contrastive samples to induce hallucinations and then suppressing them in the output distribution. However, this paper demonstrates that such approaches fail to effectively mitigate the hallucination problem. The performance improvements observed on POPE Benchmark are largely driven by two misleading factors: (1) crude, unidirectional adjustments to the model's output distribution and (2) the adaptive plausibility constraint, which reduces the sampling strategy to greedy search. To further illustrate these issues, we introduce a series of spurious improvement methods and evaluate their performance against contrastive decoding techniques. Experimental results reveal that the observed performance gains in contrastive decoding are entirely unrelated to its intended goal of mitigating hallucinations. Our findings challenge common assumptions about the effectiveness of contrastive decoding strategies and pave the way for developing genuinely effective solutions to hallucinations in MLLMs.

Abstract: When thinking with images, humans rarely rely on a single glance: they revisit visual information repeatedly during reasoning. However, existing models typically process images only once and thereafter generate reasoning entirely in text, lacking mechanisms to re-access or ground inference in visual representations. We empirically confirm this: as reasoning chains lengthen, models progressively lose focus on relevant regions. In response, we introduce v1, a lightweight extension that enables active visual referencing through a simple point-and-copy approach. This allows the model to identify relevant image patches and copy their embeddings back into the reasoning stream, ensuring that evolving hypotheses remain grounded in perceptual evidence. Crucially, our pointing strategy lets the MLLM directly select image patches using their semantic representations as keys, keeping perceptual evidence embedded in the same space as the model's reasoning. To train this capability, we construct v1g, a dataset of 300K multimodal reasoning traces with interleaved visual grounding annotations. Across various multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks, v1 consistently outperforms comparable baselines, establishing point-and-copy as a practical mechanism for grounded reasoning. The model checkpoint and dataset are available at github.com/jun297/v1.

<title>Uni-Instruct: One-step Diffusion Model through Unified Diffusion Divergence Instruction</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we unify more than 10 existing one-step diffusion distillation approaches, such as Diff-Instruct, DMD, SIM, SiD, $f$-distill, etc, inside a theory-driven framework which we name the \textbf{\emph{Uni-Instruct}}. Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the $f$-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the intractability issue of the original expanded $f$-divergence, resulting in an equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models by minimizing the expanded $f$-divergence family. The novel unification introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of \textbf{\emph{1.46}} for unconditional generation and \textbf{\emph{1.38}} for conditional generation. On the ImageNet-$64\times 64$ generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA one-step generation FID of \textbf{\emph{1.02}}, which outperforms its 79-step teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35). We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in integrating language-driven techniques into trajectory prediction. By leveraging their semantic and reasoning capabilities, LLMs are reshaping how autonomous systems perceive, model, and predict trajectories. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of this emerging field, categorizing recent work into five directions: (1) Trajectory prediction via language modeling paradigms, (2) Direct trajectory prediction with pretrained language models, (3) Language-guided scene understanding for trajectory prediction, (4) Language-driven data generation for trajectory prediction, (5) Language-based reasoning and interpretability for trajectory prediction. For each, we analyze representative methods, highlight core design choices, and identify open challenges. This survey bridges natural language processing and trajectory prediction, offering a unified perspective on how language can enrich trajectory prediction.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models have achieved remarkable progress in integrating vision and language, enabling strong performance across perception, reasoning, and domain-specific tasks. However, their capacity to reason over multiple, visually similar inputs remains insufficiently explored. Such fine-grained comparative reasoning is central to real-world tasks, especially in mathematics and education, where learners must often distinguish between nearly identical diagrams to identify correct solutions. To address this gap, we present VisioMath, a curated benchmark of 1,800 high-quality K-12 mathematics problems in which all candidate answers are diagrams with subtle visual similarities. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LMMs, covering both leading closed-source systems and widely adopted open-source models, reveals a consistent decline in accuracy as inter-image similarity increases. Analysis indicates that the dominant failure mode stems from image-text misalignment: rather than grounding reasoning in textual cues, models often resort to shallow positional heuristics, resulting in systematic errors. We further explore three alignment-oriented strategies, spanning training-free approaches and finetuning, and achieve substantial accuracy gains. We hope that VisioMath will serve as a rigorous benchmark and catalyst for developing LMMs toward deeper diagram understanding, precise comparative reasoning, and grounded multi-image-text integration.

Abstract: Edge computing enables data processing closer to the source, significantly reducing latency, an essential requirement for real-time vision-based analytics such as object detection in surveillance and smart city environments. However, these tasks place substantial demands on resource-constrained edge devices, making the joint optimization of energy consumption and detection accuracy critical. To address this challenge, we propose ECORE, a framework that integrates multiple dynamic routing strategies, including a novel estimation-based techniques and an innovative greedy selection algorithm, to direct image processing requests to the most suitable edge device-model pair. ECORE dynamically balances energy efficiency and detection performance based on object characteristics. We evaluate our framework through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, comparing against widely used baseline techniques. The evaluation leverages established object detection models (YOLO, SSD, EfficientDet) and diverse edge platforms, including Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 4 and 5, and TPU accelerators. Results demonstrate that our proposed context-aware routing strategies can reduce energy consumption and latency by 35% and 49%, respectively, while incurring only a 2% loss in detection accuracy compared to accuracy-centric methods.

Abstract: Nitrogen (N) is one of the most crucial nutrients in vineyards, affecting plant growth and subsequent products such as wine and juice. Because soil N has high spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate the N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the individual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used in-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of four different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over two growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N concentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two feature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral bands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral bands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models, Gradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The comparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets showed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection methods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level datasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm, and 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral regions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction demonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level data and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets of selected spectral bands for each analysis level. The study demonstrated the potential of using in-field hyperspectral imaging and the use of spectral data in integrated feature selection and ML techniques to monitor N status in vineyards.

We introduce a structured framework that combines automated components with human oversight to address the complexities of advertisement localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate scene text detection, inpainting, machine translation (MT), and text reimposition specifically for accelerating ad localization evaluation workflows. Qualitative results across six locales demonstrate that our approach produces semantically accurate and visually coherent localized advertisements, suitable for deployment in real-world workflows.

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink, where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity. Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together, the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the linear setting. Our code is available at https://github.com/killian31/SPCARobustness.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work, we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and support the advancement of VLMs.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted growing interest in both computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, primarily due to their inherent energy efficiency and compact memory footprint. However, achieving adversarial robustness in SNNs, particularly for vision-related tasks, remains a nascent and underexplored challenge. Recent studies have proposed leveraging sparse gradients as a form of regularization to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. In this work, we present a surprising finding: under specific architectural configurations, SNNs exhibit natural gradient sparsity and can achieve state-of-the-art adversarial defense performance without the need for any explicit regularization. Further analysis reveals a trade-off between robustness and generalization: while sparse gradients contribute to improved adversarial resilience, they can impair the model's ability to generalize; conversely, denser gradients support better generalization but increase vulnerability to attacks.

Summary:
The article addresses concerns regarding the unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted content by large vision models like Stable Diffusion. It introduces the concept of copyright infringement detection from a Differential Privacy (DP) perspective and proposes the conditional sensitivity metric to quantify deviations in model outputs. The D-Plus-Minus (DPM) framework is presented as a novel approach for detecting copyright infringement in text-to-image diffusion models by simulating inclusion and exclusion processes through fine-tuning. DPM computes confidence scores to distinguish concept-specific influence from global parameter shifts and offers a practical solution for protecting intellectual property. The creation of the Copyright Infringement Detection Dataset (CIDD) provides a benchmarking resource for evaluating detection performance across various categories. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of DPM in reliably detecting infringement content without requiring access to the original training data or text prompts.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy (DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning. Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

Summary:
Mask What Matters introduces a controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image analysis. It uses vision-language models to localize diagnostically relevant regions and apply targeted masking to improve semantic alignment. This approach leads to better representation learning and cross-task generalizability compared to existing methods. Evaluation across various medical imaging modalities demonstrates superior performance in classification accuracy, box average precision, and mask average precision for detection tasks. The method achieves these results with lower overall masking ratios, indicating efficiency and effectiveness in enhancing model performance for medical image analysis.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution, existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas. This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1 percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision (BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios (e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

<div> Sparse-view novel view synthesis, OracleGS, generative completeness, regressive fidelity, sparse view Gaussian Splatting<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces OracleGS, a framework that combines generative models with regressive models for sparse-view novel view synthesis. To address the inherent geometric ambiguity in sparse-view synthesis, OracleGS uses a pre-trained 3D-aware diffusion model to propose complete scenes and a multi-view stereo model as an oracle to validate the proposed views. By leveraging multi-view evidence and uncertainty signals, OracleGS guides the optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model, resulting in more accurate and realistic novel view synthesis. The approach outperforms existing methods on datasets such as Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic, striking a balance between generative completeness and regressive fidelity. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our "propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the 3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss. Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

Summary:
EfficientMIL introduces a linear-complexity MIL approach for classifying whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology. By utilizing the Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) module, EfficientMIL replaces self-attention mechanisms with more efficient sequence models like GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model, resulting in significant computational efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset, EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of 0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than conventional selection strategies.

<div> Keywords: vision-language models, pruning, complexity-adaptive, AutoPrune, computational reduction

Summary:
Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune) is a framework designed to reduce computational demands in vision-language models by tailoring pruning policies based on varying sample and task complexities. Unlike traditional pruning methods, AutoPrune dynamically adjusts token elimination to align with the model's reasoning trajectory. By quantifying the mutual information between visual and textual tokens and projecting it onto budget-constrained logistic retention curves, AutoPrune can accommodate different task complexities while adhering to predefined computational constraints. Experimental results on vision-language tasks and Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving show that AutoPrune significantly reduces the number of visual tokens and FLOPs during inference while maintaining high accuracy levels. In comparison to previous methods, AutoPrune demonstrates a 9.1% improvement in performance. The code for AutoPrune is publicly available for further exploration and implementation. 

<br /><br />Summary: 
AutoPrune is a novel framework for complexity-adaptive pruning in vision-language models, offering dynamic token elimination based on sample and task complexities. By leveraging mutual information and logistic retention curves, AutoPrune optimizes computational resources while maintaining high accuracy levels in various tasks. Experimental results showcase significant reductions in visual tokens and FLOPs with improved performance compared to existing methods. The availability of the AutoPrune code allows for easy implementation and further exploration in this domain. <div>

Abstract: The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop, demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/AutoLab-SAI-SJTU/AutoPrune.

Summary:<br />
FrameMind is introduced as an end-to-end framework for video understanding, using reinforcement learning to dynamically request visual information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (FiCOT). The model operates in multiple turns alternating between textual reasoning and active visual perception to extract targeted frames or video clips based on identified knowledge gaps. Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS) is proposed to train effective sampling policies, exposing models to diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning. DRFS-GRPO is also introduced as a group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME show that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in flexible and efficient video understanding.

Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies, processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in flexible and efficient video understanding.

Summary: <br />
The article discusses how adding simple visual structures enhances the performance of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by introducing the concept of Grounding IDs. Grounding IDs are latent identifiers that bind objects to their designated partitions across modalities. Through representation analysis, it is found that Grounding IDs facilitate within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions confirm that Grounding IDs mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. These identifiers strengthen attention between related components, improving cross-modal grounding and reducing hallucinations. Overall, the study identifies Grounding IDs as a crucial symbolic mechanism that explains how external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and practical improvements in robustness. <div>

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures, such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together, our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and practical improvements in robustness.

Summary:
<br />
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown improvements in various tasks. This study introduces Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a new paradigm enabling autoregressive reasoning in the visual embedding space. By projecting images into visual tokens shared with the language model, key visual tokens are generated to aid in answering queries. The model shows significant improvements in visual question answering tasks, particularly in fine-grained visual understanding and perception. The adaptation of the GRPO algorithm for reinforcement learning on latent reasoning further enhances the balance between LVR and textual generation. The proposed LVR approach outperforms existing methods, achieving a 71.67% accuracy on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. The code base and model weights will be made available in the future.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained: reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code base and model weights will be released later.

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables in situ visualization of macromolecular structures, where subtomogram analysis tasks such as classification, alignment, and averaging are critical for structural determination. However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations, severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over 904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24 synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets, advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.

<div> prediction, tumor trajectories, oncology, treatment planning, digital twin

Summary:
The article introduces a new computational framework called Standard-of-Care Digital Twin (SoC-DT) that aims to accurately predict tumor trajectories under standard-of-care therapies in oncology. This framework integrates reaction-diffusion tumor growth models, discrete SoC interventions like surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy, as well as personalization based on genomics and demographics to forecast post-treatment tumor structure on imaging. An implicit-explicit exponential time-differencing solver, IMEX-SoC, is also introduced to ensure stability, positivity, and scalability in SoC treatment scenarios. Evaluations on synthetic data and real-world glioma data demonstrate that SoC-DT outperforms classical partial differential equation baselines and purely data-driven neural models in predicting tumor dynamics. By combining mechanistic interpretability with modern differentiable solvers, SoC-DT paves the way for creating patient-specific digital twins in oncology that enable biologically consistent estimation of tumor dynamics. Code for the framework will be available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of tumor trajectories under standard-of-care (SoC) therapies remains a major unmet need in oncology. This capability is essential for optimizing treatment planning and anticipating disease progression. Conventional reaction-diffusion models are limited in scope, as they fail to capture tumor dynamics under heterogeneous therapeutic paradigms. There is hence a critical need for computational frameworks that can realistically simulate SoC interventions while accounting for inter-patient variability in genomics, demographics, and treatment regimens. We introduce Standard-of-Care Digital Twin (SoC-DT), a differentiable framework that unifies reaction-diffusion tumor growth models, discrete SoC interventions (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) along with genomic and demographic personalization to predict post-treatment tumor structure on imaging. An implicit-explicit exponential time-differencing solver, IMEX-SoC, is also proposed, which ensures stability, positivity, and scalability in SoC treatment situations. Evaluated on both synthetic data and real world glioma data, SoC-DT consistently outperforms classical PDE baselines and purely data-driven neural models in predicting tumor dynamics. By bridging mechanistic interpretability with modern differentiable solvers, SoC-DT establishes a principled foundation for patient-specific digital twins in oncology, enabling biologically consistent tumor dynamics estimation. Code will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: In an era dominated by video content, understanding its structure and dynamics has become increasingly important. This paper presents a hybrid framework that combines a distributed multi-GPU inference system with an interactive visualization platform for analyzing celebrity dynamics in video episodes. The inference framework efficiently processes large volumes of video data by leveraging optimized ONNX models, heterogeneous batch inference, and high-throughput parallelism, ensuring scalable generation of timestamped appearance records. These records are then transformed into a comprehensive suite of visualizations, including appearance frequency charts, duration analyses, pie charts, co-appearance matrices, network graphs, stacked area charts, seasonal comparisons, and heatmaps. Together, these visualizations provide multi-dimensional insights into video content, revealing patterns in celebrity prominence, screen-time distribution, temporal dynamics, co-appearance relationships, and intensity across episodes and seasons. The interactive nature of the system allows users to dynamically explore data, identify key moments, and uncover evolving relationships between individuals. By bridging distributed recognition with structured, visually-driven analytics, this work enables new possibilities for entertainment analytics, content creation strategies, and audience engagement studies.

Summary: <br />
Marine plastic pollution is a significant environmental concern, demanding reliable automation for underwater debris detection. In this study, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers were trained on an underwater dataset and evaluated on a cross-domain test set to assess their robustness. MobileNetV2 demonstrated the strongest performance in cross-domain detection. While all fine-tuned models achieved high precision, they varied in recall, indicating different sensitivity levels to plastic instances. The zero-shot models, CLIP and Gemini, showed different trade-offs between sensitivity and precision, with CLIP being more sensitive but prone to false positives, and Gemini exhibiting higher precision but lower sensitivity. Error analysis revealed common confusion with coral textures, suspended particulates, and specular glare. In conclusion, compact CNNs with supervised training are effective for cross-domain underwater detection, while large pretrained vision-language models offer additional strengths. <div>

Abstract: Marine plastic pollution is a pressing environmental threat, making reliable automation for underwater debris detection essential. However, vision systems trained on one dataset often degrade on new imagery due to domain shift. This study benchmarks models for cross-domain robustness, training convolutional neural networks - CNNs (MobileNetV2, ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision transformers (DeiT-Tiny, ViT-B16) on a labeled underwater dataset and then evaluates them on a balanced cross-domain test set built from plastic-positive images drawn from a different source and negatives from the training domain. Two zero-shot models were assessed, CLIP ViT-L14 and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash, that leverage pretraining to classify images without fine-tuning. Results show the lightweight MobileNetV2 delivers the strongest cross-domain performance (F1 0.97), surpassing larger models. All fine-tuned models achieved high Precision (around 99%), but differ in Recall, indicating varying sensitivity to plastic instances. Zero-shot CLIP is comparatively sensitive (Recall around 80%) yet prone to false positives (Precision around 56%), whereas Gemini exhibits the inverse profile (Precision around 99%, Recall around 81%). Error analysis highlights recurring confusions with coral textures, suspended particulates, and specular glare. Overall, compact CNNs with supervised training can generalize effectively for cross-domain underwater detection, while large pretrained vision-language models provide complementary strengths.

Summary:
VLCAP is an Arabic image captioning framework that combines CLIP-based visual label retrieval with multimodal text generation. The framework utilizes three multilingual encoders to extract interpretable Arabic visual concepts and builds a hybrid vocabulary enriched with general domain labels. Through a two-stage process, top-retrieved labels are transformed into fluent Arabic prompts and used in conjunction with vision-language models for caption generation. Six encoder-decoder configurations were tested, with mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision achieving the best BLEU-1 and cosine similarity scores, while AraCLIP + Qwen-VL obtained the highest LLM-judge score. This approach aims to produce culturally coherent and contextually accurate Arabic captions, providing a versatile and reliable solution for image captioning in the Arabic language.

arXiv:2510.03295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present VLCAP, an Arabic image captioning framework that integrates CLIP-based visual label retrieval with multimodal text generation. Rather than relying solely on end-to-end captioning, VLCAP grounds generation in interpretable Arabic visual concepts extracted with three multilingual encoders, mCLIP, AraCLIP, and Jina V4, each evaluated separately for label retrieval. A hybrid vocabulary is built from training captions and enriched with about 21K general domain labels translated from the Visual Genome dataset, covering objects, attributes, and scenes. The top-k retrieved labels are transformed into fluent Arabic prompts and passed along with the original image to vision-language models. In the second stage, we tested Qwen-VL and Gemini Pro Vision for caption generation, resulting in six encoder-decoder configurations. The results show that mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision achieved the best BLEU-1 (5.34%) and cosine similarity (60.01%), while AraCLIP + Qwen-VL obtained the highest LLM-judge score (36.33%). This interpretable pipeline enables culturally coherent and contextually accurate Arabic captions.

Abstract: We present a controlled comparison of a convolutional neural network (EfficientNet-B0) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-Base) on SpaceNet under two label-distribution regimes: a naturally imbalanced five-class split and a balanced-resampled split with 700 images per class (70:20:10 train/val/test). With matched preprocessing (224x224, ImageNet normalization), lightweight augmentations, and a 40-epoch budget on a single NVIDIA P100, we report accuracy, macro-F1, balanced accuracy, per-class recall, and deployment metrics (model size and latency). On the imbalanced split, EfficientNet-B0 reaches 93% test accuracy with strong macro-F1 and lower latency; ViT-Base is competitive at 93% with a larger parameter count and runtime. On the balanced split, both models are strong; EfficientNet-B0 reaches 99% while ViT-Base remains competitive, indicating that balancing narrows architecture gaps while CNNs retain an efficiency edge. We release manifests, logs, and per-image predictions to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and cyclists, remains a critical global challenge, as conventional infrastructure-based measures often prove inadequate in dynamic urban environments. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in visual perception and reasoning, open new opportunities for proactive and context-aware VRU protection. However, existing surveys on AI applications for VRUs predominantly focus on detection, offering limited coverage of other vision-based tasks that are essential for comprehensive VRU understanding and protection. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of recent progress in camera-based AI sensing systems for VRU safety, with an emphasis on developments from the past five years and emerging research trends. We systematically examine four core tasks, namely detection and classification, tracking and reidentification, trajectory prediction, and intent recognition and prediction, which together form the backbone of AI-empowered proactive solutions for VRU protection in intelligent transportation systems. To guide future research, we highlight four major open challenges from the perspectives of data, model, and deployment. By linking advances in visual AI with practical considerations for real-world implementation, this survey aims to provide a foundational reference for the development of next-generation sensing systems to enhance VRU safety.

Abstract: Earth Observation Foundation Models (EOFMs) have exploded in prevalence as tools for processing the massive volumes of remotely sensed and other earth observation data, and for delivering impact on the many essential earth monitoring tasks. An emerging trend posits using the outputs of pre-trained models as 'embeddings' which summarize high dimensional data to be used for generic tasks such as similarity search and content-specific queries. However, most EOFM models are trained only on single modalities of data and then applied or benchmarked by matching bands across different modalities. It is not clear from existing work what impact diverse sensor architectures have on the internal representations of the present suite of EOFMs. We show in this work that the representation space of EOFMs is highly sensitive to sensor architecture and that understanding this difference gives a vital perspective on the pitfalls of current EOFM design and signals for how to move forward as model developers, users, and a community guided by robust remote-sensing science.

<div> Keywords: Ecological monitoring, vision models, explanation technique, perturbation-based, species recognition.

Summary:<br />
Ecological monitoring is increasingly using automated vision models, but the opaque nature of their predictions limits trust and adoption in the field. A new explanation technique has been developed that uses inpainting-guided, perturbation-based methods to create photorealistic edits that indicate which morphological cues drive predictions in tasks like species recognition. By producing mask-localized edits that preserve scene context, this technique allows for greater interpretability and trust in the model's predictions. The approach was demonstrated on a YOLOv9 detector fine-tuned for harbor seal detection in Glacier Bay drone imagery, showing how object and background replacements can provide valuable insights for ecologists. Expert validation confirmed the plausibility and interpretability of the explanations, highlighting the potential for more trustworthy deployment of AI in ecology. <div>

Abstract: Ecological monitoring is increasingly automated by vision models, yet opaque predictions limit trust and field adoption. We present an inpainting-guided, perturbation-based explanation technique that produces photorealistic, mask-localized edits that preserve scene context. Unlike masking or blurring, these edits stay in-distribution and reveal which fine-grained morphological cues drive predictions in tasks such as species recognition and trait attribution. We demonstrate the approach on a YOLOv9 detector fine-tuned for harbor seal detection in Glacier Bay drone imagery, using Segment-Anything-Model-refined masks to support two interventions: (i) object removal/replacement (e.g., replacing seals with plausible ice/water or boats) and (ii) background replacement with original animals composited onto new scenes. Explanations are assessed by re-scoring perturbed images (flip rate, confidence drop) and by expert review for ecological plausibility and interpretability. The resulting explanations localize diagnostic structures, avoid deletion artifacts common to traditional perturbations, and yield domain-relevant insights that support expert validation and more trustworthy deployment of AI in ecology.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, early detection of wafer defects is critical for product yield optimization. However, raw wafer data from wafer quality tests are often complex, unlabeled, imbalanced and can contain multiple defects on a single wafer, making it crucial to design clustering methods that remain reliable under such imperfect data conditions. We introduce DECOR, a deep clustering with orientation robustness framework that groups complex defect patterns from wafer maps into consistent clusters. We evaluate our method on the open source MixedWM38 dataset, demonstrating its ability to discover clusters without manual tuning. DECOR explicitly accounts for orientation variations in wafer maps, ensuring that spatially similar defects are consistently clustered regardless of its rotation or alignment. Experiments indicate that our method outperforms existing clustering baseline methods, thus providing a reliable and scalable solution in automated visual inspection systems.

Summary:
- This study addresses error correction in multi-class facial expression classification using unbalanced datasets.
- The research focuses on a database of images categorized into seven emotional states across different age groups.
- An LSTM-based neural network with an attention mechanism targeting key facial areas is proposed for classification.
- Experiments involve training the model on six out of seven classes and then correcting errors for the excluded class.
- Results show successful correction across all classes, with varying degrees of accuracy for each emotion.
- Improvement in quality metrics for underrepresented classes suggests applicability in fraud detection and facial expression analysis systems.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of error correction in multi-class classification of face images on unbalanced samples. The study is based on the analysis of a data frame containing images labeled by seven different emotional states of people of different ages. Particular attention is paid to the problem of class imbalance, in which some emotions significantly prevail over others. To solve the classification problem, a neural network model based on LSTM with an attention mechanism focusing on key areas of the face that are informative for emotion recognition is used. As part of the experiments, the model is trained on all possible configurations of subsets of six classes with subsequent error correction for the seventh class, excluded at the training stage. The results show that correction is possible for all classes, although the degree of success varies: some classes are better restored, others are worse. In addition, on the test sample, when correcting some classes, an increase in key quality metrics for small classes was recorded, which indicates the promise of the proposed approach in solving applied problems related to the search for rare events, for example, in anti-fraud systems. Thus, the proposed method can be effectively applied in facial expression analysis systems and in tasks requiring stable classification under skewed class distribution.

Abstract: Dynamic Chart Generation (DCG) involves producing code-rendered animated visualizations as charts. While recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly improved their capability on static chart generation and comprehension, MLLMs' potential for handling dynamic chart generation and understanding remains underexplored. To bridge this research gap, we introduce DCG-Bench (Dynamic Chart Generation Benchmark), the first benchmark evaluating MLLM's capability on dynamic chart generation tasks from three dimensions: Simple Text-to-Chart, Detailed Text-to-Chart, and Video-to-Chart tasks. We construct DCG-8K, a high-quality DCG dataset with annotations covering instruction-code-video triplets and QA pairs for both code and video evaluation. Based on DCG-8K, we explored a two-stage training recipe, proposing Joint-Code-Visual Reward for group relative policy optimization to construct expert MLLM Qwen2.5-VL-DCG-3B for the DCG task. Our benchmarking result reveals shortcomings of existing MLLMs in the visual-to-chart task, and our model beats the best open-sourced MLLM with an average 8.31% performance gain across three tasks, and shows on par performance against proprietary models with only 3B parameters, proving the effectiveness of our training recipe. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces VoT, a Visual odometry Transformer, for monocular visual odometry that eliminates the need for handcrafted components. VoT processes sequences of monocular frames using attention mechanisms to model global relationships and directly predicts camera motion without dense geometry estimation. It relies solely on camera poses for supervision and can integrate various pre-trained encoders as feature extractors. The framework scales effectively with larger datasets, benefits from stronger pre-trained backbones, generalizes across diverse camera motions and calibration settings, and outperforms traditional methods while running over three times faster. The code for VoT will be released, making it accessible for further research and development. <div>
arXiv:2510.03348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern monocular visual odometry methods typically combine pre-trained deep learning components with optimization modules, resulting in complex pipelines that rely heavily on camera calibration and hyperparameter tuning, and often struggle in unseen real-world scenarios. Recent large-scale 3D models trained on massive amounts of multi-modal data have partially alleviated these challenges, providing generalizable dense reconstruction and camera pose estimation. Still, they remain limited in handling long videos and providing accurate per-frame estimates, which are required for visual odometry. In this work, we demonstrate that monocular visual odometry can be addressed effectively in an end-to-end manner, thereby eliminating the need for handcrafted components such as bundle adjustment, feature matching, camera calibration, or dense 3D reconstruction. We introduce VoT, short for Visual odometry Transformer, which processes sequences of monocular frames by extracting features and modeling global relationships through temporal and spatial attention. Unlike prior methods, VoT directly predicts camera motion without estimating dense geometry and relies solely on camera poses for supervision. The framework is modular and flexible, allowing seamless integration of various pre-trained encoders as feature extractors. Experimental results demonstrate that VoT scales effectively with larger datasets, benefits substantially from stronger pre-trained backbones, generalizes across diverse camera motions and calibration settings, and outperforms traditional methods while running more than 3 times faster. The code will be released.

Summary:
Diffusion models are effective priors for inverse problems, but often overlook valuable side information that can enhance reconstruction quality in challenging scenarios. A new inference-time search algorithm is proposed in this study to leverage side information and strike a balance between exploration and exploitation during the sampling process. This method offers more accurate and reliable reconstructions compared to traditional gradient-based guidance methods, which are susceptible to artifacts. The algorithm seamlessly integrates into existing diffusion-based image reconstruction pipelines and demonstrates enhanced performance in various tasks such as box inpainting, super-resolution, and different deblurring challenges like motion, Gaussian, nonlinear, and blind deblurring. Extensive experiments show consistently improved qualitative and quantitative results over baseline methods, including reward gradient-based guidance techniques. The code implementation is available in a public repository for further exploration and application. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. However, existing approaches typically overlook side information that could significantly improve reconstruction quality, especially in severely ill-posed settings. In this work, we propose a novel inference-time search algorithm that guides the sampling process using the side information in a manner that balances exploration and exploitation. This enables more accurate and reliable reconstructions, providing an alternative to the gradient-based guidance that is prone to reward-hacking artifacts. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing diffusion-based image reconstruction pipelines. Through extensive experiments on a number of inverse problems, such as box inpainting, super-resolution, and various deblurring tasks including motion, Gaussian, nonlinear, and blind deblurring, we show that our approach consistently improves the qualitative and quantitative performance of diffusion-based image reconstruction algorithms. We also show the superior performance of our approach with respect to other baselines, including reward gradient-based guidance algorithms.

More specifically, our pipeline enables efficient reconstruction of light fields emitted from a display from a viewing cone of 46.6{\deg} X 37.6{\deg}.

Summary: Provenance networks are a new class of neural models that aim to provide end-to-end explainability by linking each prediction directly to its supporting training examples. These models embed interpretability into their architecture, similar to a learned KNN, where each output is justified by relevant training exemplars in the feature space. They facilitate trade-off investigations between memorization and generalization, verify input inclusion in the training set, detect mislabeled or anomalous data, enhance resilience to perturbations, and identify similar inputs contributing to new data generation. By jointly optimizing the primary task and explainability objective, provenance networks offer insights into model behavior that traditional deep networks cannot. While they incur additional computational costs and currently scale to moderately-sized datasets, they complement existing explainability techniques and address challenges in deep learning such as model opaqueness, hallucination, and credit assignment to data contributors, thus improving transparency, robustness, and trustworthiness in neural models. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: We introduce provenance networks, a novel class of neural models designed to provide end-to-end, training-data-driven explainability. Unlike conventional post-hoc methods, provenance networks learn to link each prediction directly to its supporting training examples as part of the model's normal operation, embedding interpretability into the architecture itself. Conceptually, the model operates similarly to a learned KNN, where each output is justified by concrete exemplars weighted by relevance in the feature space. This approach facilitates systematic investigations of the trade-off between memorization and generalization, enables verification of whether a given input was included in the training set, aids in the detection of mislabeled or anomalous data points, enhances resilience to input perturbations, and supports the identification of similar inputs contributing to the generation of a new data point. By jointly optimizing the primary task and the explainability objective, provenance networks offer insights into model behavior that traditional deep networks cannot provide. While the model introduces additional computational cost and currently scales to moderately sized datasets, it provides a complementary approach to existing explainability techniques. In particular, it addresses critical challenges in modern deep learning, including model opaqueness, hallucination, and the assignment of credit to data contributors, thereby improving transparency, robustness, and trustworthiness in neural models.

<div> Keywords: Unsupervised anomaly detection, multimodal scenarios, unified UAD, matching noise, anomaly cost volume 

Summary: 
Unified Cost Filtering (UCF) is a post-hoc refinement framework for enhancing unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) models by addressing matching noise in both unimodal (RGB) and multimodal (RGB--3D, RGB--Text) scenarios. The UCF framework constructs an anomaly cost volume by matching a test sample against normal samples and utilizes a learnable filtering module with multi-layer attention guidance to highlight subtle anomalies while mitigating noise. The approach improves the efficacy of various UAD methods, consistently achieving new state-of-the-art results on 22 diverse benchmarks. By advocating for a unified UAD approach, UCF offers a comprehensive understanding and knowledge transfer between different UAD settings. The code and models for UCF will be made available on GitHub at https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD. <div>
arXiv:2510.03363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to identify image- and pixel-level anomalies using only normal training data, with wide applications such as industrial inspection and medical analysis, where anomalies are scarce due to privacy concerns and cold-start constraints. Existing methods, whether reconstruction-based (restoring normal counterparts) or embedding-based (pretrained representations), fundamentally conduct image- or feature-level matching to generate anomaly maps. Nonetheless, matching noise has been largely overlooked, limiting their detection ability. Beyond earlier focus on unimodal RGB-based UAD, recent advances expand to multimodal scenarios, e.g., RGB--3D and RGB--Text, enabled by point cloud sensing and vision--language models. Despite shared challenges, these lines remain largely isolated, hindering a comprehensive understanding and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we advocate unified UAD for both unimodal and multimodal settings in the matching perspective. Under this insight, we present Unified Cost Filtering (UCF), a generic post-hoc refinement framework for refining anomaly cost volume of any UAD model. The cost volume is constructed by matching a test sample against normal samples from the same or different modalities, followed by a learnable filtering module with multi-layer attention guidance from the test sample, mitigating matching noise and highlighting subtle anomalies. Comprehensive experiments on 22 diverse benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of UCF in enhancing a variety of UAD methods, consistently achieving new state-of-the-art results in both unimodal (RGB) and multimodal (RGB--3D, RGB--Text) UAD scenarios. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced multimodal reasoning but still face challenges in spatial reasoning for 3D scenes and complex object configurations. To address this, we introduce SpatialViLT, an enhanced VLM that integrates spatial features like depth maps, 3D coordinates, and edge maps through a multi-task learning framework. This approach enriches multimodal embeddings with spatial understanding. We propose two variants: SpatialViLT and MaskedSpatialViLT, focusing on full and masked object regions, respectively. Additionally, SpatialEnsemble combines both approaches, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy. Our models excel in spatial reasoning categories such as directional, topological, and proximity relations, as demonstrated on the challenging Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) dataset. This work represents a significant step in enhancing the spatial intelligence of AI systems, crucial for advanced multimodal understanding and real-world applications.

Summary:<br />
Structured illumination (SI) enhances image resolution and contrast in two-phase optical-sectioning SI (OS-SI), but residual artifacts in reduced acquisition time pose challenges for denoising. This study explores the use of encoder-decoder networks for artifact reduction in OS-SI, utilizing synthetic training data with real artifact fields. An asymmetrical denoising autoencoder (DAE) and a U-Net were trained and evaluated on real OS-SI images, showing improvement in image clarity against different artifact types.

Abstract: Structured illumination (SI) enhances image resolution and contrast by projecting patterned light onto a sample. In two-phase optical-sectioning SI (OS-SI), reduced acquisition time introduces residual artifacts that conventional denoising struggles to suppress. Deep learning offers an alternative to traditional methods; however, supervised training is limited by the lack of clean, optically sectioned ground-truth data. We investigate encoder-decoder networks for artifact reduction in two-phase OS-SI, using synthetic training pairs formed by applying real artifact fields to synthetic images. An asymmetrical denoising autoencoder (DAE) and a U-Net are trained on the synthetic data, then evaluated on real OS-SI images. Both networks improve image clarity, with each excelling against different artifact types. These results demonstrate that synthetic training enables supervised denoising of OS-SI images and highlight the potential of encoder-decoder networks to streamline reconstruction workflows.

<div> Keywords: histopathology, spatial transcriptomics, pathway activation scores, multimodal framework, computational pathology 

Summary: 
PEaRL (Pathway Enhanced Representation Learning) is a novel multimodal framework that integrates histopathology with spatial transcriptomics to link tissue morphology with molecular function. By representing transcriptomics through pathway activation scores computed with ssGSEA and encoding them with a transformer, PEaRL reduces dimensionality and strengthens cross-modal correspondence with histology features. In three cancer ST datasets, PEaRL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy for gene- and pathway-level expression prediction. This approach yields up to 58.9% and 20.4% increase in Pearson correlation coefficient compared to existing methods. Grounding transcriptomic representation in pathways leads to more biologically faithful and interpretable multimodal models, advancing computational pathology beyond gene-level embeddings.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Integrating histopathology with spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides a powerful opportunity to link tissue morphology with molecular function. Yet most existing multimodal approaches rely on a small set of highly variable genes, which limits predictive scope and overlooks the coordinated biological programs that shape tissue phenotypes. We present PEaRL (Pathway Enhanced Representation Learning), a multimodal framework that represents transcriptomics through pathway activation scores computed with ssGSEA. By encoding biologically coherent pathway signals with a transformer and aligning them with histology features via contrastive learning, PEaRL reduces dimensionality, improves interpretability, and strengthens cross-modal correspondence. Across three cancer ST datasets (breast, skin, and lymph node), PEaRL consistently outperforms SOTA methods, yielding higher accuracy for both gene- and pathway-level expression prediction (up to 58.9 percent and 20.4 percent increase in Pearson correlation coefficient compared to SOTA). These results demonstrate that grounding transcriptomic representation in pathways produces more biologically faithful and interpretable multimodal models, advancing computational pathology beyond gene-level embeddings.

Abstract: Deep learning for medical imaging is hampered by task-specific models that lack generalizability and prognostic capabilities, while existing 'universal' approaches suffer from simplistic conditioning and poor medical semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we introduce DuPLUS, a deep learning framework for efficient multi-modal medical image analysis. DuPLUS introduces a novel vision-language framework that leverages hierarchical semantic prompts for fine-grained control over the analysis task, a capability absent in prior universal models. To enable extensibility to other medical tasks, it includes a hierarchical, text-controlled architecture driven by a unique dual-prompt mechanism. For segmentation, DuPLUS is able to generalize across three imaging modalities, ten different anatomically various medical datasets, encompassing more than 30 organs and tumor types. It outperforms the state-of-the-art task specific and universal models on 8 out of 10 datasets. We demonstrate extensibility of its text-controlled architecture by seamless integration of electronic health record (EHR) data for prognosis prediction, and on a head and neck cancer dataset, DuPLUS achieved a Concordance Index (CI) of 0.69. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables rapid adaptation to new tasks and modalities from varying centers, establishing DuPLUS as a versatile and clinically relevant solution for medical image analysis.

Abstract: Real-time animal detection and segmentation in natural environments are vital for wildlife conservation, enabling non-invasive monitoring through remote camera streams. However, these tasks remain challenging due to limited computational resources and the cryptic appearance of many species. We propose a mobile-optimized two-stage deep learning framework that integrates a Threading Detection Model (TDM) to parallelize YOLOv10-based detection and MobileSAM-based segmentation. Unlike prior YOLO+SAM pipelines, our approach improves real-time performance by reducing latency through threading. YOLOv10 handles detection while MobileSAM performs lightweight segmentation, both executed concurrently for efficient resource use. On the cryptic Houbara Bustard, a conservation-priority species, our model achieves mAP50 of 0.9627, mAP75 of 0.7731, mAP95 of 0.7178, and a MobileSAM mIoU of 0.7421. YOLOv10 operates at 43.7 ms per frame, confirming real-time readiness. We introduce a curated Houbara dataset of 40,000 annotated images to support model training and evaluation across diverse conditions.

<div> Transformers, geometric symmetries, Platonic Transformer, attention, equivariance <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The Platonic Transformer addresses the lack of geometric symmetries in traditional Transformers without sacrificing efficiency. By incorporating attention relative to Platonic solid symmetry groups, the model induces a principled weight-sharing scheme, allowing for equivariance to continuous translations and Platonic symmetries while maintaining the computational cost of a standard Transformer. The attention mechanism is equivalent to dynamic group convolution, enabling the model to learn adaptive geometric filters and support a scalable, linear-time convolutional variant. The Platonic Transformer demonstrates competitive performance across various computer vision, 3D point cloud, and molecular property prediction benchmarks by leveraging geometric constraints at no extra cost. <div>
arXiv:2510.03511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While widespread, Transformers lack inductive biases for geometric symmetries common in science and computer vision. Existing equivariant methods often sacrifice the efficiency and flexibility that make Transformers so effective through complex, computationally intensive designs. We introduce the Platonic Transformer to resolve this trade-off. By defining attention relative to reference frames from the Platonic solid symmetry groups, our method induces a principled weight-sharing scheme. This enables combined equivariance to continuous translations and Platonic symmetries, while preserving the exact architecture and computational cost of a standard Transformer. Furthermore, we show that this attention is formally equivalent to a dynamic group convolution, which reveals that the model learns adaptive geometric filters and enables a highly scalable, linear-time convolutional variant. Across diverse benchmarks in computer vision (CIFAR-10), 3D point clouds (ScanObjectNN), and molecular property prediction (QM9, OMol25), the Platonic Transformer achieves competitive performance by leveraging these geometric constraints at no additional cost.

Abstract: The generalization of deep neural networks to unknown domains is a major challenge despite their tremendous progress in recent years. For this reason, the dynamic area of domain generalization (DG) has emerged. In contrast to unsupervised domain adaptation, there is no access to or knowledge about the target domains, and DG methods aim to generalize across multiple different unseen target domains. Domain generalization is particularly relevant for the task semantic segmentation which is used in several areas such as biomedicine or automated driving. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the rapidly evolving topic of domain generalized semantic segmentation. We cluster and review existing approaches and identify the paradigm shift towards foundation-model-based domain generalization. Finally, we provide an extensive performance comparison of all approaches, which highlights the significant influence of foundation models on domain generalization. This survey seeks to advance domain generalization research and inspire scientists to explore new research directions.

Summary: 
The article introduces a new automated report generation model designed to alleviate the documentation burden associated with endoscopic procedures such as EGD and colonoscopy. By utilizing a transformer-based vision encoder and text decoder in a two-stage training framework, the model aims to streamline the documentation process for gastroenterologists. In the initial stage, the components are pre-trained on image/text pairs to capture generalized vision-language features, before being fine-tuned on images/report pairs to generate clinically relevant findings. This approach not only holds promise for reducing physician workload but also has the potential to improve patient care by enhancing efficiency in clinical workflows. The automation of report generation in endoscopic procedures has the potential to combat physician burnout and contribute to better overall patient outcomes.

Abstract: Endoscopic procedures such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy play a critical role in diagnosing and managing gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. However, the documentation burden associated with these procedures place significant strain on gastroenterologists, contributing to inefficiencies in clinical workflows and physician burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a novel automated report generation model that leverages a transformer-based vision encoder and text decoder within a two-stage training framework. In the first stage, both components are pre-trained on image/text caption pairs to capture generalized vision-language features, followed by fine-tuning on images/report pairs to generate clinically meaningful findings. Our approach not only streamlines the documentation process but also holds promise for reducing physician workload and improving patient care.

Summary: 
SketchPlan is a novel planner that interprets 2D hand-drawn sketches to generate 3D flight paths for drone navigation. It consists of two components: SketchAdapter and DiffPath. The model achieves sim-to-real transfer, generating accurate flight paths in new environments. A synthetic dataset of 32k flight paths is used for training, with labels obtained from 2D projections onto the camera plane. Real human sketches are also incorporated into training the SketchAdapter. The model is effective in simulated and real-world experiments, with 100% success in low/medium clutter environments and 40% in high-clutter settings. A mix of human-labeled and auto-labeled data, along with a modular design, enhances the model's ability to interpret human intent and infer 3D paths. SketchPlan outperforms key ablations by 20-60% in task completion during real-world drone tests. <div>

Abstract: We propose SketchPlan, a diffusion-based planner that interprets 2D hand-drawn sketches over depth images to generate 3D flight paths for drone navigation. SketchPlan comprises two components: a SketchAdapter that learns to map the human sketches to projected 2D paths, and DiffPath, a diffusion model that infers 3D trajectories from 2D projections and a first person view depth image. Our model achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, generating accurate and safe flight paths in previously unseen real-world environments. To train the model, we build a synthetic dataset of 32k flight paths using a diverse set of photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. We automatically label the data by computing 2D projections of the 3D flight paths onto the camera plane, and use this to train the DiffPath diffusion model. However, since real human 2D sketches differ significantly from ideal 2D projections, we additionally label 872 of the 3D flight paths with real human sketches and use this to train the SketchAdapter to infer the 2D projection from the human sketch. We demonstrate SketchPlan's effectiveness in both simulated and real-world experiments, and show through ablations that training on a mix of human labeled and auto-labeled data together with a modular design significantly boosts its capabilities to correctly interpret human intent and infer 3D paths. In real-world drone tests, SketchPlan achieved 100\% success in low/medium clutter and 40\% in unseen high-clutter environments, outperforming key ablations by 20-60\% in task completion.

<div> pose-expression latent; talking-head videoconferencing systems; biometric information; deepfake detection; identity protection <br />
Summary: <br />
AI-based talking-head videoconferencing systems face a security threat where an attacker can puppeteer the pose-expression latent to impersonate a victim without being detected by traditional deepfake detection methods. This article introduces a novel defense mechanism that leverages the biometric information present in the latent to detect unauthorized identity swaps in real-time. By using a pose-conditioned contrastive encoder, the system can isolate the identity cues while filtering out transient pose and expression changes. This approach outperforms existing defenses, operates in real-time, and demonstrates strong generalization to different scenarios. Through a simple cosine test on the disentangled embedding, illicit identity swaps can be flagged as the video is rendered, providing a robust defense against identity hijacking in AI-based video conferencing systems. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.03548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-based talking-head videoconferencing systems reduce bandwidth by sending a compact pose-expression latent and re-synthesizing RGB at the receiver, but this latent can be puppeteered, letting an attacker hijack a victim's likeness in real time. Because every frame is synthetic, deepfake and synthetic video detectors fail outright. To address this security problem, we exploit a key observation: the pose-expression latent inherently contains biometric information of the driving identity. Therefore, we introduce the first biometric leakage defense without ever looking at the reconstructed RGB video: a pose-conditioned, large-margin contrastive encoder that isolates persistent identity cues inside the transmitted latent while cancelling transient pose and expression. A simple cosine test on this disentangled embedding flags illicit identity swaps as the video is rendered. Our experiments on multiple talking-head generation models show that our method consistently outperforms existing puppeteering defenses, operates in real-time, and shows strong generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Summary: 
The paper presents a new task called REVEL for fine-grained interactive video manipulation that allows users to modify generated videos in real time through drag-style interactions. The proposed DragStream method addresses challenges such as latent distribution drift and interference from context frames during streaming drag operations. It includes an adaptive distribution self-rectification strategy to constrain drift in latent embeddings and a spatial-frequency selective optimization mechanism to effectively utilize contextual information while minimizing interference. The DragStream method can be seamlessly integrated into existing autoregressive video diffusion models, offering improved control and alignment with user expectations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and benefits of DragStream in achieving streaming, fine-grained control over video outputs. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.03550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving streaming, fine-grained control over the outputs of autoregressive video diffusion models remains challenging, making it difficult to ensure that they consistently align with user expectations. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{stReaming drag-oriEnted interactiVe vidEo manipuLation (REVEL)}, a new task that enables users to modify generated videos \emph{anytime} on \emph{anything} via fine-grained, interactive drag. Beyond DragVideo and SG-I2V, REVEL unifies drag-style video manipulation as editing and animating video frames with both supporting user-specified translation, deformation, and rotation effects, making drag operations versatile. In resolving REVEL, we observe: \emph{i}) drag-induced perturbations accumulate in latent space, causing severe latent distribution drift that halts the drag process; \emph{ii}) streaming drag is easily disturbed by context frames, thereby yielding visually unnatural outcomes. We thus propose a training-free approach, \textbf{DragStream}, comprising: \emph{i}) an adaptive distribution self-rectification strategy that leverages neighboring frames' statistics to effectively constrain the drift of latent embeddings; \emph{ii}) a spatial-frequency selective optimization mechanism, allowing the model to fully exploit contextual information while mitigating its interference via selectively propagating visual cues along generation. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing autoregressive video diffusion models, and extensive experiments firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of our DragStream.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed computational pathology by providing powerful, general-purpose feature extractors. However, adapting and benchmarking individual FMs for specific diagnostic tasks is often time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially given their scale and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce Group-Aggregative Selection Multi-Instance Learning (GAS-MIL), a flexible ensemble framework that seamlessly integrates features from multiple FMs, preserving their complementary strengths without requiring manual feature selection or extensive task-specific fine-tuning. Across classification tasks in three cancer datasets-prostate (PANDA), ovarian (UBC-OCEAN), and breast (TCGA-BrCa)-GAS-MIL consistently achieves superior or on-par performance relative to individual FMs and established MIL methods, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability. By enabling efficient integration of heterogeneous FMs, GAS-MIL streamlines model deployment for pathology and provides a scalable foundation for future multimodal and precision oncology applications.

Abstract: Rapid naloxone delivery via drones offers a promising solution for responding to opioid overdose emergencies (OOEs), by extending lifesaving interventions to medically untrained bystanders before emergency medical services (EMS) arrive. Recognizing the critical role of bystander situational awareness (SA) in human-autonomy teaming (HAT), we address a key research gap in real-time SA assessment by introducing the Drone-Assisted Naloxone Delivery Simulation Dataset (DANDSD). This pioneering dataset captures HAT during simulated OOEs, where college students without medical training act as bystanders tasked with administering intranasal naloxone to a mock overdose victim. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a video-based real-time SA assessment framework that utilizes graph embeddings and transformer models to assess bystander SA in real time. Our approach integrates visual perception and comprehension cues--such as geometric, kinematic, and interaction graph features--and achieves high-performance SA prediction. It also demonstrates strong temporal segmentation accuracy, outperforming the FINCH baseline by 9% in Mean over Frames (MoF) and 5% in Intersection over Union (IoU). This work supports the development of adaptive drone systems capable of guiding bystanders effectively, ultimately improving emergency response outcomes and saving lives.

Summary: 
This study evaluates four open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems, Tesseract, EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, and TrOCR, on real-world food packaging images to extract ingredient lists and nutrition facts panels. Accuracy in OCR for packaging is essential for compliance and nutrition monitoring but faces challenges such as multilingual text, dense layouts, varied fonts, glare, and curved surfaces. The evaluation was conducted on a dataset of 231 products processed by all four models for speed and coverage, with a ground truth subset of 113 images created for accuracy assessment. Tesseract performed best in terms of Character Error Rate (CER) and BLEU score, while EasyOCR provided good accuracy and multilingual support. PaddleOCR showed high coverage but was slower due to CPU usage. TrOCR yielded the weakest results despite GPU acceleration. These findings establish a packaging-specific benchmark, suggest the need for layout-aware methods, and emphasize directions for improvement in text localization. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: This study evaluates four open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems which are Tesseract, EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, and TrOCR on real world food packaging images. The aim is to assess their ability to extract ingredient lists and nutrition facts panels. Accurate OCR for packaging is important for compliance and nutrition monitoring but is challenging due to multilingual text, dense layouts, varied fonts, glare, and curved surfaces. A dataset of 231 products (1,628 images) was processed by all four models to assess speed and coverage, and a ground truth subset of 113 images (60 products) was created for accuracy evaluation. Metrics include Character Error Rate (CER), Word Error Rate (WER), BLEU, ROUGE-L, F1, coverage, and execution time. On the ground truth subset, Tesseract achieved the lowest CER (0.912) and the highest BLEU (0.245). EasyOCR provided a good balance between accuracy and multilingual support. PaddleOCR achieved near complete coverage but was slower because it ran on CPU only due to GPU incompatibility, and TrOCR produced the weakest results despite GPU acceleration. These results provide a packaging-specific benchmark, establish a baseline, and highlight directions for layout-aware methods and text localization.

<div> FrameOracle, Video Understanding, Vision-Language Models, Frame Selection, Efficiency<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces FrameOracle, a module that predicts relevant frames and the necessary number of frames for video understanding tasks in vision-language models. It is trained using a four-stage curriculum, including weak proxy signals and supervision from the FrameOracle-41K dataset. By reducing 16-frame inputs to an average of 10.4 frames without accuracy loss and starting from 64-frame candidates to an average of 13.9 frames while improving accuracy by 1.4%, FrameOracle achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs in video understanding. The module enhances efficiency and information retention in VLMs, addressing limitations from existing frame sampling strategies and adapting to task complexity and information density. <div>

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced video understanding, but their performance is limited by the number of input frames they can process. Existing frame sampling strategies, such as uniform or fixed-budget selection, often fail to adapt to variations in information density or task complexity, resulting in inefficiency and information loss. To address this, we present FrameOracle, a lightweight and plug-and-play module that predicts both (1) which frames are most relevant to a given query and (2) how many frames are needed. FrameOracle is trained using a four-stage curriculum, with the first three stages relying on weak proxy signals such as cross-modal similarity. In the final stage, it leverages stronger supervision from a new dataset we introduce, FrameOracle-41K, the first large-scale VideoQA collection to provide keyframe annotations specifying the minimal set of frames required to answer each question. Extensive experiments across five VLMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that FrameOracle reduces 16-frame inputs to an average of 10.4 frames without any loss in accuracy. When starting from 64-frame candidates, it reduces the input to an average of 13.9 frames while improving accuracy by 1.4%, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs for scalable video understanding.

<div> Keywords: visual bug detection, video games, Co-FineTuning, unlabeled data, feature representation learning

Summary:
The paper introduces a hybrid Co-FineTuning (CFT) method for visual bug detection in video games. Traditional methods for identifying visual bugs in games are resource-intensive and rely on extensive labeled datasets, which can be challenging due to the infrequent occurrence of such bugs. The proposed CFT method leverages both labeled samples from the target game and unlabeled data, allowing for enhanced feature representation learning. This approach reduces the dependency on labeled examples from the specific target game, making the visual bug detection process more scalable and adaptable across various game titles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the CFT method, showing superior performance compared to conventional baselines in detecting visual bugs in multiple gaming environments. Even when trained with only 50% of the labeled data from the target game, CFT maintains competitive performance, showcasing its robustness in visual bug detection.

Abstract: Manual identification of visual bugs in video games is a resource-intensive and costly process, often demanding specialized domain knowledge. While supervised visual bug detection models offer a promising solution, their reliance on extensive labeled datasets presents a significant challenge due to the infrequent occurrence of such bugs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a hybrid Co-FineTuning (CFT) method that effectively integrates both labeled and unlabeled data. Our approach leverages labeled samples from the target game and diverse co-domain games, additionally incorporating unlabeled data to enhance feature representation learning. This strategy maximizes the utility of all available data, substantially reducing the dependency on labeled examples from the specific target game. The developed framework demonstrates enhanced scalability and adaptability, facilitating efficient visual bug detection across various game titles. Our experimental results show the robustness of the proposed method for game visual bug detection, exhibiting superior performance compared to conventional baselines across multiple gaming environments. Furthermore, CFT maintains competitive performance even when trained with only 50% of the labeled data from the target game.

<br />
Summary: 
The paper evaluates the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) for image classification on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets. HRM utilizes Transformer-style modules, one-step training, deep supervision, Rotary Position Embeddings, and RMSNorm. Results show that HRM performs well on MNIST but struggles with small natural images, exhibiting overfitting and poor generalization. On CIFAR-10, HRM achieves 65.0% accuracy after 25 epochs, compared to 77.2% for a Conv-BN-ReLU baseline. Similarly, on CIFAR-100, HRM only reaches 29.7% test accuracy despite high train accuracy, while the CNN baseline achieves 45.3% accuracy. The study suggests that HRM lacks sufficient inductive bias for image classification without data augmentation. It concludes that, in its current state, HRM is not competitive with simple convolutional architectures for small-resolution image classification but leaves open the possibility of improvements through model modifications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: This paper asks whether the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) with the two Transformer-style modules $(f_L,f_H)$, one step (DEQ-style) training, deep supervision, Rotary Position Embeddings, and RMSNorm can serve as a practical image classifier. It is evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under a deliberately raw regime: no data augmentation, identical optimizer family with one-epoch warmup then cosine-floor decay, and label smoothing. HRM optimizes stably and performs well on MNIST ($\approx 98\%$ test accuracy), but on small natural images it overfits and generalizes poorly: on CIFAR-10, HRM reaches 65.0\% after 25 epochs, whereas a two-stage Conv--BN--ReLU baseline attains 77.2\% while training $\sim 30\times$ faster per epoch; on CIFAR-100, HRM achieves only 29.7\% test accuracy despite 91.5\% train accuracy, while the same CNN reaches 45.3\% test with 50.5\% train accuracy. Loss traces and error analyses indicate healthy optimization but insufficient image-specific inductive bias for HRM in this regime. It is concluded that, for small-resolution image classification without augmentation, HRM is not competitive with even simple convolutional architectures as the HRM currently exist but this does not exclude possibilities that modifications to the model may allow it to improve greatly.

Summary:
Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS) is a new framework for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) that addresses challenges in generalization and data scarcity. DCS establishes a feedback loop between diffusion models and FSCIL classifiers, using a reward-aligned learning strategy. It incorporates a dynamic reward function operating at both feature and logits levels to ensure semantic coherence, diversity, exploratory image generation, and inter-class discriminability. This co-evolutionary process leads to improved performance on FSCIL benchmarks, enhancing both knowledge retention and new class learning. <div>
arXiv:2510.03608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation, their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class learning.

The framework includes a domain-specific dataset with vision-question-answer samples covering mining regulations. Key innovations like a clause filter module and a behavior magnifier module enhance the detection process. Experimental results show significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1 score compared to baseline models. The framework outperforms baseline models by 22.01% in precision, 34.22% in recall, and 28.37% in F1 score. A web-based interface integrates MonitorVLM into practical workflows for automatic violation reporting with video timestamping. This study demonstrates the potential of multimodal large models to enhance occupational safety monitoring in high-risk industries like mining. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial accidents, particularly in high-risk domains such as surface and underground mining, are frequently caused by unsafe worker behaviors. Traditional manual inspection remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and insufficient for large-scale, dynamic environments, highlighting the urgent need for intelligent and automated safety monitoring. In this paper, we present MonitorVLM, a novel vision--language framework designed to detect safety violations directly from surveillance video streams. MonitorVLM introduces three key innovations: (1) a domain-specific violation dataset comprising 9,000 vision--question--answer (VQA) samples across 40 high-frequency mining regulations, enriched with augmentation and auxiliary detection cues; (2) a clause filter (CF) module that dynamically selects the Top-$K$ most relevant clauses, reducing inference latency by 13.56\% while maintaining accuracy; and (3) a behavior magnifier (BM) module that enhances worker regions to improve fine-grained action recognition, yielding additional gains of 3.45% in precision and 8.62% in recall. Experimental results demonstrate that MonitorVLM significantly outperforms baseline vision--language models, achieving improvements of 22.01% in precision, 34.22\% in recall, and 28.37% in F1 score over the 72B unfine-tuned baseline. A lightweight web-based interface further integrates MonitorVLM into practical workflows, enabling automatic violation reporting with video timestamping. This study highlights the potential of multimodal large models to enhance occupational safety monitoring in mining and beyond.

Abstract: The integration of Diffusion Models into Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is a substantial improvement in the detection of accidents. We present a novel hybrid model integrating guidance classification with diffusion techniques. By leveraging fine-tuned ExceptionNet architecture outputs as input for our proposed diffusion model and processing image tensors as our conditioning, our approach creates a robust classification framework. Our model consists of multiple conditional modules, which aim to modulate the linear projection of inputs using time embeddings and image covariate embeddings, allowing the network to adapt its behavior dynamically throughout the diffusion process. To address the computationally intensive nature of diffusion models, our implementation is cloud-based, enabling scalable and efficient processing. Our strategy overcomes the shortcomings of conventional classification approaches by leveraging diffusion models inherent capacity to effectively understand complicated data distributions. We investigate important diffusion characteristics, such as timestep schedulers, timestep encoding techniques, timestep count, and architectural design changes, using a thorough ablation study, and have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model against the baseline models on a publicly available dataset. The proposed diffusion model performs best in image-based accident detection with an accuracy of 97.32%.

Summary:
SAMSOD is a new model for RGB-T salient object detection that aims to improve performance by addressing the imbalance convergence of two modalities and the significant gradient difference between high- and low-activations. The model utilizes unimodal supervision to enhance learning of the non-dominant modality and employs gradient deconfliction to reduce the impact of conflicting gradients on model convergence. Additionally, SAMSOD leverages two decoupled adapters to separately mask high- and low-activation neurons, emphasizing foreground objects by enhancing background learning. Experimental results on RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets and generalizability experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Overall, SAMSOD offers a promising approach for enhancing salient object detection in RGB-T images. 

<br /><br />Summary: SAMSOD enhances RGB-T salient object detection by addressing modality imbalance, gradient differences, and leveraging decoupled adapters for foreground object emphasis. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in improving performance on benchmark datasets and in generalizability experiments. <div>
arXiv:2510.03689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RGB-T salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment attractive objects by combining RGB and thermal infrared images. To enhance performance, the Segment Anything Model has been fine-tuned for this task. However, the imbalance convergence of two modalities and significant gradient difference between high- and low- activations are ignored, thereby leaving room for further performance enhancement. In this paper, we propose a model called \textit{SAMSOD}, which utilizes unimodal supervision to enhance the learning of non-dominant modality and employs gradient deconfliction to reduce the impact of conflicting gradients on model convergence. The method also leverages two decoupled adapters to separately mask high- and low-activation neurons, emphasizing foreground objects by enhancing background learning. Fundamental experiments on RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets and generalizability experiments on scribble supervised RGB-T SOD, fully supervised RGB-D SOD datasets and full-supervised RGB-D rail surface defect detection all demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Referring expression comprehension (REC) aims to localize the target object described by a natural language expression. Recent advances in vision-language learning have led to significant performance improvements in REC tasks. However, localizing extremely small objects remains a considerable challenge despite its importance in real-world applications such as autonomous driving. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset and method for REC targeting small objects. First, we present the small object REC (SOREC) dataset, which consists of 100,000 pairs of referring expressions and corresponding bounding boxes for small objects in driving scenarios. Second, we propose the progressive-iterative zooming adapter (PIZA), an adapter module for parameter-efficient fine-tuning that enables models to progressively zoom in and localize small objects. In a series of experiments, we apply PIZA to GroundingDINO and demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy on the SOREC dataset. Our dataset, codes and pre-trained models are publicly available on the project page.

Summary:
The article introduces a new Deep Learning approach, Attention-WNet, for segmenting retinal blood vessels into arteries and veins. The segmentation is crucial for analyzing and diagnosing retinal eye diseases, as well as assessing overall vascular health. The proposed model incorporates an attention mechanism into the WNet architecture and has been tested on HRF and DRIVE datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models in performance. By accurately identifying alterations in retinal blood vessels, such as irregularities in width and structure, the model can help predict the risk of developing vascular diseases like stroke and myocardial infarction. This innovative approach showcases the potential of attention mechanisms in enhancing image segmentation tasks for medical applications.

Abstract: Segmenting of clinically important retinal blood vessels into arteries and veins is a prerequisite for retinal vessel analysis. Such analysis can provide potential insights and bio-markers for identifying and diagnosing various retinal eye diseases. Alteration in the regularity and width of the retinal blood vessels can act as an indicator of the health of the vasculature system all over the body. It can help identify patients at high risk of developing vasculature diseases like stroke and myocardial infarction. Over the years, various Deep Learning architectures have been proposed to perform retinal vessel segmentation. Recently, attention mechanisms have been increasingly used in image segmentation tasks. The work proposes a new Deep Learning approach for artery-vein segmentation. The new approach is based on the Attention mechanism that is incorporated into the WNet Deep Learning model, and we call the model as Attention-WNet. The proposed approach has been tested on publicly available datasets such as HRF and DRIVE datasets. The proposed approach has outperformed other state-of-art models available in the literature.

Summary:<br />
The study investigates the role of training data in producing demographic biases in vision-language models trained on large-scale multimodal datasets. The researchers created person-centric annotations for the LAION-400M dataset, including bounding boxes, perceived gender and race/ethnicity labels, and automatically generated captions. They identified demographic imbalances and harmful associations in the data, such as linking men and individuals perceived as Black or Middle Eastern with crime-related and negative content. The study found that a significant portion of gender bias in models like CLIP and Stable Diffusion can be attributed to direct co-occurrences in the training data. This research provides evidence of the link between dataset composition and downstream model bias, shedding light on the importance of addressing demographic biases in training data for AI models. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.03721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models trained on large-scale multimodal datasets show strong demographic biases, but the role of training data in producing these biases remains unclear. A major barrier has been the lack of demographic annotations in web-scale datasets such as LAION-400M. We address this gap by creating person-centric annotations for the full dataset, including over 276 million bounding boxes, perceived gender and race/ethnicity labels, and automatically generated captions. These annotations are produced through validated automatic labeling pipelines combining object detection, multimodal captioning, and finetuned classifiers. Using them, we uncover demographic imbalances and harmful associations, such as the disproportionate linking of men and individuals perceived as Black or Middle Eastern with crime-related and negative content. We also show that 60-70% of gender bias in CLIP and Stable Diffusion can be linearly explained by direct co-occurrences in the data. Our resources establish the first large-scale empirical link between dataset composition and downstream model bias.

Summary: 
This study compares two types of pretrained neural networks for detecting informal settlements in Rio de Janeiro: generic networks pretrained on diverse image datasets and specialized networks pretrained on satellite imagery. The research aims to determine which approach, task specificity or data volume, leads to better performance in identifying urban informal settlements. While the specialized network is tailored to the target task, the generic network benefits from being pretrained on a larger number of images. By exploring the effectiveness of these two approaches, the study seeks to optimize the detection of informal settlements using deep learning methods. The findings will contribute to the enhancement of detection techniques for informal settlements and potentially improve urban planning strategies in informal settlement areas.

Abstract: While deep learning methods for detecting informal settlements have already been developed, they have not yet fully utilized the potential offered by recent pretrained neural networks. We compare two types of pretrained neural networks for detecting the favelas of Rio de Janeiro: 1. Generic networks pretrained on large diverse datasets of unspecific images, 2. A specialized network pretrained on satellite imagery. While the latter is more specific to the target task, the former has been pretrained on significantly more images. Hence, this research investigates whether task specificity or data volume yields superior performance in urban informal settlement detection.

Summary:<br />
The paper discusses the weaknesses of current proactive defenses against deepfakes and introduces a novel approach called Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) patching. This method involves injecting a LoRA patch into deepfake generators to bypass existing defenses. A learnable gating mechanism is used to control the patch's effect and prevent gradient explosions during fine-tuning. Additionally, a Multi-Modal Feature Alignment (MMFA) loss is introduced to align features of adversarial outputs with desired outputs at the semantic level. The paper also presents defensive LoRA patching, which embeds visible warnings in outputs as a way to mitigate security vulnerabilities. With only 1,000 facial examples and one epoch of fine-tuning, LoRA patching successfully defeats multiple proactive defenses. These findings highlight the need for more robust deepfake defense strategies. <div>

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant societal risks, motivating the development of proactive defenses that embed adversarial perturbations in facial images to prevent manipulation. However, in this paper, we show that these preemptive defenses often lack robustness and reliability. We propose a novel approach, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) patching, which injects a plug-and-play LoRA patch into Deepfake generators to bypass state-of-the-art defenses. A learnable gating mechanism adaptively controls the effect of the LoRA patch and prevents gradient explosions during fine-tuning. We also introduce a Multi-Modal Feature Alignment (MMFA) loss, encouraging the features of adversarial outputs to align with those of the desired outputs at the semantic level. Beyond bypassing, we present defensive LoRA patching, embedding visible warnings in the outputs as a complementary solution to mitigate this newly identified security vulnerability. With only 1,000 facial examples and a single epoch of fine-tuning, LoRA patching successfully defeats multiple proactive defenses. These results reveal a critical weakness in current paradigms and underscore the need for more robust Deepfake defense strategies. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZOMIN28/LoRA-Patching.

Summary:
Reference-Set-Finetuning (RSF) is proposed to improve Visual Place Recognition (VPR) performance on challenging benchmarks by leveraging the test-time reference set. This approach involves fine-tuning VPR models on the map containing images and poses of the target domain. Results show a significant increase (~2.3% on average for Recall@1) in the performance of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) VPR methods on challenging datasets. The finetuned models maintain generalization and enhance performance across diverse test datasets. RSF serves as a complementary source of information to bridge the train-test domain gap and addresses the limitations faced by current VPR benchmarks, particularly when test environments differ from typical training datasets.

Abstract: Given a query image, Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is the task of retrieving an image of the same place from a reference database with robustness to viewpoint and appearance changes. Recent works show that some VPR benchmarks are solved by methods using Vision-Foundation-Model backbones and trained on large-scale and diverse VPR-specific datasets. Several benchmarks remain challenging, particularly when the test environments differ significantly from the usual VPR training datasets. We propose a complementary, unexplored source of information to bridge the train-test domain gap, which can further improve the performance of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) VPR methods on such challenging benchmarks. Concretely, we identify that the test-time reference set, the "map", contains images and poses of the target domain, and must be available before the test-time query is received in several VPR applications. Therefore, we propose to perform simple Reference-Set-Finetuning (RSF) of VPR models on the map, boosting the SOTA (~2.3% increase on average for Recall@1) on these challenging datasets. Finetuned models retain generalization, and RSF works across diverse test datasets.

<div> Keywords: Sharpness-Aware Minimization, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Second-order gradient, Model generalization, Optimization speedup

Summary: 
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) enhances model generalization but at the cost of doubling the computational burden of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). To address this, the authors introduce Adaptively sampling-Reusing-mixing decomposed gradients (ARSAM), which decomposes SAM's gradient into the SGD gradient and the Projection of the Second-order gradient onto the First-order gradient (PSF). They observe that the roles of the SGD gradient and PSF evolve dynamically during training, with the PSF becoming increasingly important for reaching flat minima. ARSAM reuses and updates the PSF to maintain model generalization while significantly accelerating optimization. Experimental results across various network architectures demonstrate that ARSAM achieves state-of-the-art accuracies similar to SAM, with a speedup of around 40% on CIFAR-10/100 datasets. Furthermore, ARSAM proves effective for challenging tasks like human pose estimation and model quantization, showcasing its versatility in practical applications. The code for ARSAM is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization but doubles the computational cost of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) by requiring twice the gradient calculations per optimization step. To mitigate this, we propose Adaptively sampling-Reusing-mixing decomposed gradients to significantly accelerate SAM (ARSAM). Concretely, we firstly discover that SAM's gradient can be decomposed into the SGD gradient and the Projection of the Second-order gradient onto the First-order gradient (PSF). Furthermore, we observe that the SGD gradient and PSF dynamically evolve during training, emphasizing the growing role of the PSF to achieve a flat minima. Therefore, ARSAM is proposed to the reused PSF and the timely updated PSF still maintain the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that ARSAM achieves state-of-the-art accuracies comparable to SAM across diverse network architectures. On CIFAR-10/100, ARSAM is comparable to SAM while providing a speedup of about 40\%. Moreover, ARSAM accelerates optimization for the various challenge tasks (\textit{e.g.}, human pose estimation, and model quantization) without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its broad practicality.% The code is publicly accessible at: https://github.com/ajiaaa/ARSAM.

Summary:
The article introduces a novel framework called Concept Prompting and Aggregating (CoPA) to enhance the transparency of deep learning models in clinical diagnostics by capturing multilayer concepts under prompt guidance. Traditional concept-based methods face challenges in capturing shallow and multiscale features, thus hindering fine-grained concept extraction. CoPA addresses these issues by utilizing the Concept-aware Embedding Generator (CEG) to extract concept representations from each layer of the visual encoder and Concept Prompt Tuning (CPT) to amplify critical concept-related visual cues. The framework aggregates visual representations from each layer to align with textual concept representations, resulting in improved concept and disease prediction performance. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that CoPA outperforms existing methods. The code for CoPA is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.

Abstract: The transparency of deep learning models is essential for clinical diagnostics. Concept Bottleneck Model provides clear decision-making processes for diagnosis by transforming the latent space of black-box models into human-understandable concepts. However, concept-based methods still face challenges in concept capture capabilities. These methods often rely on encode features solely from the final layer, neglecting shallow and multiscale features, and lack effective guidance in concept encoding, hindering fine-grained concept extraction. To address these issues, we introduce Concept Prompting and Aggregating (CoPA), a novel framework designed to capture multilayer concepts under prompt guidance. This framework utilizes the Concept-aware Embedding Generator (CEG) to extract concept representations from each layer of the visual encoder. Simultaneously, these representations serve as prompts for Concept Prompt Tuning (CPT), steering the model towards amplifying critical concept-related visual cues. Visual representations from each layer are aggregated to align with textual concept representations. With the proposed method, valuable concept-wise information in the images is captured and utilized effectively, thus improving the performance of concept and disease prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CoPA outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/yihengd/CoPA.

Summary:
The study explores the use of the ZFP compression technique to address challenges in collaborative research and transferability of large 3D medical imaging datasets. The research focuses on automated cerebrovascular segmentation, crucial for detecting intracranial aneurysms. By applying ZFP in error tolerance and fixed-rate modes to a recent, large-scale 3D medical dataset, the study compares the segmentation quality on compressed volumes to an uncompressed baseline. The findings indicate that ZFP can achieve substantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity, with a mean Dice coefficient of 0.87656. Specifically, ZFP can achieve up to a 22.89:1 ratio in error tolerance mode.

Abstract: The increasing size and complexity of medical imaging datasets, particularly in 3D formats, present significant barriers to collaborative research and transferability. This study investigates whether the ZFP compression technique can mitigate these challenges without compromising the performance of automated cerebrovascular segmentation, a critical first step in intracranial aneurysm detection. We apply ZFP in both its error tolerance and fixed-rate modes to a large scale, and one of the most recent, datasets in the literature, 3D medical dataset containing ground-truth vascular segmentations. The segmentation quality on the compressed volumes is rigorously compared to the uncompressed baseline (Dice approximately equals 0.8774). Our findings reveal that ZFP can achieve substantial data reduction--up to a 22.89:1 ratio in error tolerance mode--while maintaining a high degree of fidelity, with the mean Dice coefficient remaining high at 0.87656. These results demonstrate that ZFP is a viable and powerful tool for enabling more efficient and accessible research on large-scale medical datasets, fostering broader collaboration across the community.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has shown near-expert performance in segmenting complex medical tissues and tumors. However, existing models are often task-specific, with performance varying across modalities and anatomical regions. Balancing model complexity and performance remains challenging, particularly in clinical settings where both accuracy and efficiency are critical. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid segmentation architecture featuring a three-branch encoder that integrates CNNs, Transformers, and a Mamba-based Attention Fusion (MAF) mechanism to capture local, global, and long-range dependencies. A multi-scale attention-based CNN decoder reconstructs fine-grained segmentation maps while preserving contextual consistency. Additionally, a co-attention gate enhances feature selection by emphasizing relevant spatial and semantic information across scales during both encoding and decoding, improving feature interaction and cross-scale communication. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and generalization, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. By effectively balancing efficiency and effectiveness, our architecture offers a practical and scalable solution for diverse medical imaging tasks. Source code and trained models will be publicly released upon acceptance to support reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Urban safety and infrastructure maintenance are critical components of smart city development. Manual monitoring of road damages is time-consuming, highly costly, and error-prone. This paper presents a deep learning approach for automated road damage and manhole detection using the YOLOv9 algorithm with polygonal annotations. Unlike traditional bounding box annotation, we employ polygonal annotations for more precise localization of road defects. We develop a novel dataset comprising more than one thousand images which are mostly collected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. This dataset is used to train a YOLO-based model for three classes, namely Broken, Not Broken, and Manhole. We achieve 78.1% overall image-level accuracy. The YOLOv9 model demonstrates strong performance for Broken (86.7% F1-score) and Not Broken (89.2% F1-score) classes, with challenges in Manhole detection (18.2% F1-score) due to class imbalance. Our approach offers an efficient and scalable solution for monitoring urban infrastructure in developing countries.

<title>Contrastive-SDE: Guiding Stochastic Differential Equations with Contrastive Learning for Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03821</link>

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation involves learning mappings between source domain and target domain in the absence of aligned or corresponding samples. Score based diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in generative tasks. Their ability to approximate complex data distributions through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) enables them to generate high-fidelity and diverse outputs, making them particularly well-suited for unpaired I2I settings. In parallel, contrastive learning provides a powerful framework for learning semantic similarities without the need for explicit supervision or paired data. By pulling together representations of semantically similar samples and pushing apart dissimilar ones, contrastive methods are inherently aligned with the objectives of unpaired translation. Its ability to selectively enforce semantic consistency at the feature level makes contrastive learning particularly effective for guiding generation in unpaired scenarios. In this work, we propose a time-dependent contrastive learning approach where a model is trained with SimCLR by considering an image and its domain invarient feature as a positive pair, enabling the preservation of domain-invariant features and the discarding of domain-specific ones. The learned contrastive model then guides the inference of a pretrained SDE for the I2I translation task. We empirically compare Contrastive-SDE with several baselines across three common unpaired I2I tasks, using four metrics for evaluation. Constrastive-SDE achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art on several metrics. Furthermore, we observe that our model converges significantly faster and requires no label supervision or classifier training, making it a more efficient alternative for this task.

<title>LIBERO-PRO: Towards Robust and Fair Evaluation of Vision-Language-Action Models Beyond Memorization</title>

Abstract: LIBERO has emerged as a widely adopted benchmark for evaluating Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models; however, its current training and evaluation settings are problematic, often leading to inflated performance estimates and preventing fair model comparison. To address these issues, we introduce LIBERO-PRO, an extended LIBERO benchmark that systematically evaluates model performance under reasonable perturbations across four dimensions: manipulated objects, initial states, task instructions, and environments. Experimental results reveal that, although existing models achieve over 90% accuracy under the standard LIBERO evaluation, their performance collapses to 0.0% under our generalized setting. Crucially, this discrepancy exposes the models' reliance on rote memorization of action sequences and environment layouts from the training set, rather than genuine task understanding or environmental perception. For instance, models persist in executing grasping actions when the target object is replaced with irrelevant items, and their outputs remain unchanged even when given corrupted instructions or even messy tokens. These findings expose the severe flaws in current evaluation practices, and we call on the community to abandon misleading methodologies in favor of robust assessments of model generalization and comprehension. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Zxy-MLlab/LIBERO-PRO.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models have led to models that produce synthetic images that are increasingly difficult for standard AI detectors to identify, even though they often remain distinguishable by humans. To identify this discrepancy, we introduce \textbf{Mirage}, a curated dataset comprising a diverse range of AI-generated images exhibiting visible artifacts, where current state-of-the-art detection methods largely fail. Furthermore, we investigate whether Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are increasingly employed as substitutes for human judgment in various tasks, can be leveraged for explainable AI image detection. Our experiments on both Mirage and existing benchmark datasets demonstrate that while LVLMs are highly effective at detecting AI-generated images with visible artifacts, their performance declines when confronted with images lacking such cues.

arXiv:2510.03853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present UGround, a \textbf{U}nified visual \textbf{Ground}ing paradigm that dynamically selects intermediate layers across \textbf{U}nrolled transformers as ``mask as prompt'', diverging from the prevailing pipeline that leverages the fixed last hidden layer as ``\texttt{} as prompt''. UGround addresses two primary challenges posed by the prevailing paradigm: (1) its reliance on the fixed last hidden layer, which sequentially amplifies cumulative errors arising from layer-by-layer propagation without intermediate correction, and (2) its use of \texttt{} as a prompt, which implicitly projects textual embeddings into visual space without explicit spatial cues (\eg, coordinates). Central to UGround is Policy-Prompted Masking, which comprises two key components: Stochastic Skip Connection (SSC) and Mask as Prompt (MasP). SSC is a reinforcement learning policy that, via stochastic sampling, allows each \texttt{} token to slide across unrolled transformer layers, enabling dynamic layer selection at which it connects to the vision model (\eg, SAM) in a skip-connection fashion. Given the selected hidden layer, MasP uses the similarity map derived from the \texttt{} token and image tokens as a soft logit mask to prompt SAM for mask generation, offering explicit spatial cues through its activation regions. To validate the effectiveness of UGround, we, for the first time, have unified visual grounding within a single framework from an attribute perspective, spanning from traditional refer expression segmentation to newly proposed reasoning segmentation, single-target to multi-target, positive query to false premise (empty target). All codes and models are publicly available at \href{https://github.com/rui-qian/UGround}{https://github.com/rui-qian/UGround}.

Abstract: 4D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a new paradigm for dynamic scene representation, enabling real-time rendering of scenes with complex motions. However, it faces a major challenge of storage overhead, as millions of Gaussians are required for high-fidelity reconstruction. While several studies have attempted to alleviate this memory burden, they still face limitations in compression ratio or visual quality. In this work, we present OMG4 (Optimized Minimal 4D Gaussian Splatting), a framework that constructs a compact set of salient Gaussians capable of faithfully representing 4D Gaussian models. Our method progressively prunes Gaussians in three stages: (1) Gaussian Sampling to identify primitives critical to reconstruction fidelity, (2) Gaussian Pruning to remove redundancies, and (3) Gaussian Merging to fuse primitives with similar characteristics. In addition, we integrate implicit appearance compression and generalize Sub-Vector Quantization (SVQ) to 4D representations, further reducing storage while preserving quality. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that OMG4 significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, reducing model sizes by over 60% while maintaining reconstruction quality. These results position OMG4 as a significant step forward in compact 4D scene representation, opening new possibilities for a wide range of applications.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional object detection models are typically trained on a fixed set of classes, limiting their flexibility and making it costly to incorporate new categories. Open-vocabulary object detection addresses this limitation by enabling models to identify unseen classes without explicit training. Leveraging pretrained models contrastively trained on abundantly available ground-view image-text classification pairs provides a strong foundation for open-vocabulary object detection in aerial imagery. Domain shifts, viewpoint variations, and extreme scale differences make direct knowledge transfer across domains ineffective, requiring specialized adaptation strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adapting open-vocabulary representations from ground-view images to solve object detection in aerial imagery through structured domain alignment. The method introduces contrastive image-to-image alignment to enhance the similarity between aerial and ground-view embeddings and employs multi-instance vocabulary associations to align aerial images with text embeddings. Extensive experiments on the xView, DOTAv2, VisDrone, DIOR, and HRRSD datasets are used to validate our approach. Our open-vocabulary model achieves improvements of +6.32 mAP on DOTAv2, +4.16 mAP on VisDrone (Images), and +3.46 mAP on HRRSD in the zero-shot setting when compared to finetuned closed-vocabulary dataset-specific model performance, thus paving the way for more flexible and scalable object detection systems in aerial applications.

Abstract: Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent and deadly forms of cancer worldwide, which highlights the critical importance of early detection and diagnosis in improving patient outcomes. Deep learning (DL) has shown significant promise in enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of automated skin disease diagnosis, particularly in detecting and evaluating skin lesions and classification. However, there are still several challenges for DL-based skin cancer diagnosis, including complex features, image noise, intra-class variation, inter-class similarity, and data imbalance. By synthesizing recent research, this review discusses innovative approaches to cope with these challenges, such as data augmentation, hybrid models, and feature fusion, etc. Furthermore, the review highlights the integration of DL models into clinical workflows, offering insights into the potential of deep learning to revolutionize skin disease diagnosis and improve clinical decision-making. This article follows a comprehensive methodology based on the PRISMA framework and emphasizes the need for continued advancements to fully unlock the transformative potential of DL in dermatological care.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) achieve excellent performance in generative tasks, such as image super-resolution, but their computational requirements make difficult their deployment on resource-constrained devices. While knowledge distillation is a promising research direction for GAN compression, effectively training a smaller student generator is challenging due to the capacity mismatch between the student generator and the teacher discriminator. In this work, we propose Student Discriminator Assisted Knowledge Distillation (SDAKD), a novel GAN distillation methodology that introduces a student discriminator to mitigate this capacity mismatch. SDAKD follows a three-stage training strategy, and integrates an adapted feature map distillation approach in its last two training stages. We evaluated SDAKD on two well-performing super-resolution GANs, GCFSR and Real-ESRGAN. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over the baselines and SOTA GAN knowledge distillation methods. The SDAKD source code will be made openly available upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Diagnosing ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) requires a comprehensive analysis of both head pose and ocular movements. However, existing datasets focus on these aspects separately, limiting the development of integrated diagnostic approaches and restricting AI-driven advancements in AHP analysis. To address this gap, we introduce PoseGaze-AHP, a novel 3D dataset that synchronously captures head pose and gaze movement information for ocular-induced AHP assessment. Structured clinical data were extracted from medical literature using large language models (LLMs) through an iterative process with the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, combining stepwise, hierarchical, and complex prompting strategies. The extracted records were systematically imputed and transformed into 3D representations using the Neural Head Avatar (NHA) framework. The dataset includes 7,920 images generated from two head textures, covering a broad spectrum of ocular conditions. The extraction method achieved an overall accuracy of 91.92%, demonstrating its reliability for clinical dataset construction. PoseGaze-AHP is the first publicly available resource tailored for AI-driven ocular-induced AHP diagnosis, supporting the development of accurate and privacy-compliant diagnostic tools.

Abstract: With the rapid development of 3D scanning and reconstruction technologies, dynamic digital human avatars based on 4D meshes have become increasingly popular. A high-precision dynamic digital human avatar can be applied to various fields such as game production, animation generation, and remote immersive communication. However, these 4D human avatar meshes are prone to being degraded by various types of noise during the processes of collection, compression, and transmission, thereby affecting the viewing experience of users. In light of this fact, quality assessment of dynamic 4D digital humans becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we first propose a large-scale dynamic digital human quality assessment dataset, DHQA-4D, which contains 32 high-quality real-scanned 4D human mesh sequences, 1920 distorted textured 4D human meshes degraded by 11 textured distortions, as well as their corresponding textured and non-textured mean opinion scores (MOSs). Equipped with DHQA-4D dataset, we analyze the influence of different types of distortion on human perception for textured dynamic 4D meshes and non-textured dynamic 4D meshes. Additionally, we propose DynaMesh-Rater, a novel large multimodal model (LMM) based approach that is able to assess both textured 4D meshes and non-textured 4D meshes. Concretely, DynaMesh-Rater elaborately extracts multi-dimensional features, including visual features from a projected 2D video, motion features from cropped video clips, and geometry features from the 4D human mesh to provide comprehensive quality-related information. Then we utilize a LMM model to integrate the multi-dimensional features and conduct a LoRA-based instruction tuning technique to teach the LMM model to predict the quality scores. Extensive experimental results on the DHQA-4D dataset demonstrate the superiority of our DynaMesh-Rater method over previous quality assessment methods.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Skin cancer classification remains a challenging problem due to high inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and image noise in dermoscopic images. To address these issues, we propose an improved ResNet-50 model enhanced with Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF), which adaptively integrates multi-scale semantic and surface features to improve feature representation and reduce overfitting. The ResNet-50 model is enhanced with an adaptive feature fusion mechanism to achieve more effective multi-scale feature extraction and improve overall performance. Specifically, a dual-branch design fuses high-level semantic and mid-level detail features, which are processed through global average pooling and fully connected layers to generate adaptive weights for weighted fusion, thereby strengthening feature learning and reducing the impact of noise on classification. The method is evaluated on a subset of the ISIC 2020 dataset containing 3297 benign and malignant skin lesion images. Experimental results show that the proposed ASFF-based ResNet-50 achieves the best overall performance compared with 5 classic convolutional neural networks (CNNs) models. The proposed model reached an accuracy of 93.18% along with higher precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score. The improved model achieves an AUC value of 0.9670 and 0.9717 in the P-R and ROC curve, respectively. Then, the evaluation based on Grad-CAM further proved that the improved model adaptively focuses on lesion-relevant regions while suppressing irrelevant background information, thereby validating its enhanced feature learning capability from a deep representation perspective. These findings demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a more effective and efficient solution for computer-aided skin cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Aims Late diagnosis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) contributes significantly to its high global mortality rate, with over 50\% of cases detected at advanced stages and a 5-year survival rate below 50\% according to WHO statistics. This study aims to improve early detection of OSCC by developing a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates clinical, radiological, and histopathological images using a weighted ensemble of DenseNet-121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Material and Methods A retrospective study was conducted using publicly available datasets representing three distinct medical imaging modalities. Each modality-specific dataset was used to train a DenseNet-121 CNN via transfer learning. Augmentation and modality-specific preprocessing were applied to increase robustness. Predictions were fused using a validation-weighted ensemble strategy. Evaluation was performed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score. Results High validation accuracy was achieved for radiological (100\%) and histopathological (95.12\%) modalities, with clinical images performing lower (63.10\%) due to visual heterogeneity. The ensemble model demonstrated improved diagnostic robustness with an overall accuracy of 84.58\% on a multimodal validation dataset of 55 samples. Conclusion The multimodal ensemble framework bridges gaps in the current diagnostic workflow by offering a non-invasive, AI-assisted triage tool that enhances early identification of high-risk lesions. It supports clinicians in decision-making, aligning with global oncology guidelines to reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient outcomes.

<title>Exploring Instruction Data Quality for Explainable Image Quality Assessment</title>

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs), explainable image quality assessment (IQA) has gradually become popular, aiming at providing quality-related descriptions and answers of images. To achieve this goal, recent methods seek to construct a large-scale instruction tuning dataset to empower the MLLM with quality perception ability following the well-known scaling law. However, a large amount of instruction tuning data may cause substantial computational costs and redundant data, which in turn will cause harm to the performance of the model. To cope with this problem, in this paper, we challenge the scaling law and systematically investigate the role of data quality of the instruction tuning dataset for explainable IQA. Using a powerful pre-trained MLLM, we first investigate the changes in model performance after fine-tuning with different sizes of instruction tuning data. We find that selecting a subset of the data set randomly using an appropriate ratio can even lead to better results than training with the entire instruction tuning dataset, demonstrating the redundancy of current explainable IQA instruction tuning data. Beyond randomly sampling a subset, we propose a clustering-based data selection framework with three stages: clustering feature extraction, cluster quota allocation, and cluster sampling strategy. Then we systematically analyze the choices of each stage and propose a simple but efficient data selection method IQA-Select for explainable IQA. The experimental results demonstrate that IQA-Select can achieve 102.1% and 103.7% performance of full fine-tuning using only 10% selected data in Q-Bench and AesBench respectively, significantly reducing computational costs while achieving better performance.

<title>Bridge Thinking and Acting: Unleashing Physical Potential of VLM with Generalizable Action Expert</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03896</link>

arXiv:2510.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Vision-Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive planning and reasoning capabilities, translating these abilities into the physical world introduces significant challenges. Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture, generalize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data. While recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple "thinking" from "acting", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action module. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible. Consequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly collected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation mechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these limitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a generalizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an intermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning capabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module. During the planning phase, the VLM is only required to generate coarse 3D waypoints. These waypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines them into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud observations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust generalization, we introduce a novel "Action Pre-training, Pointcloud Fine-tuning" paradigm. Our method combines the broad generalization capabilities of VLMs in visual understanding and planning with the fine-grained, action-level generalization of action expert.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on vision-language reasoning tasks. However, their potential for zero-shot fine-grained image classification, a challenging task requiring precise differentiation between visually similar categories, remains underexplored. We present a novel method that transforms zero-shot fine-grained image classification into a visual question-answering framework, leveraging LVLMs' comprehensive understanding capabilities rather than relying on direct class name generation. We enhance model performance through a novel attention intervention technique. We also address a key limitation in existing datasets by developing more comprehensive and precise class description benchmarks. We validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experimentation across multiple fine-grained image classification benchmarks. Our proposed method consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach, demonstrating both the effectiveness of our method and the broader potential of LVLMs for zero-shot fine-grained classification tasks.

<title>From Filters to VLMs: Benchmarking Defogging Methods through Object Detection and Segmentation Performance</title>

Abstract: Autonomous driving perception systems are particularly vulnerable in foggy conditions, where light scattering reduces contrast and obscures fine details critical for safe operation. While numerous defogging methods exist-from handcrafted filters to learned restoration models-improvements in image fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, leaving questions about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of pipelines, including (i) classical filters, (ii) modern defogging networks, (iii) chained variants (filter$\rightarrow$model, model$\rightarrow$filter), and (iv) prompt-driven visual--language image editing models (VLM) applied directly to foggy images. Using Foggy Cityscapes, we assess both image quality and downstream performance on object detection (mAP) and segmentation (PQ, RQ, SQ). Our analysis reveals when defogging helps, when chaining yields synergy or degradation, and how VLM-based editors compare to dedicated approaches. In addition, we evaluate qualitative rubric-based scores from a VLM judge and quantify their alignment with task metrics, showing strong correlations with mAP. Together, these results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods and highlight the conditions under which preprocessing genuinely improves autonomous perception in adverse weather.

Abstract: Human video generation is becoming an increasingly important task with broad applications in graphics, entertainment, and embodied AI. Despite the rapid progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation. It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs, mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions, conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use cases.

Abstract: World-scale augmented reality (AR) applications need a ubiquitous 6DoF localization backend to anchor content to the real world consistently across devices. Large organizations such as Google and Niantic are 3D scanning outdoor public spaces in order to build their own Visual Positioning Systems (VPS). These centralized VPS solutions fail to meet the needs of many future AR applications -- they do not cover private indoor spaces because of privacy concerns, regulations, and the labor bottleneck of updating and maintaining 3D scans. In this paper, we present OpenFLAME, a federated VPS backend that allows independent organizations to 3D scan and maintain a separate VPS service for their own spaces. This enables access control of indoor 3D scans, distributed maintenance of the VPS backend, and encourages larger coverage. Sharding of VPS services introduces several unique challenges -- coherency of localization results across spaces, quality control of VPS services, selection of the right VPS service for a location, and many others. We introduce the concept of federated image-based localization and provide reference solutions for managing and merging data across maps without sharing private data.

Abstract: Automated tennis stroke analysis has advanced significantly with the integration of biomechanical motion cues alongside deep learning techniques, enhancing stroke classification accuracy and player performance evaluation. Despite these advancements, existing systems often fail to connect biomechanical insights with actionable language feedback that is both accessible and meaningful to players and coaches. This research project addresses this gap by developing a novel framework that extracts key biomechanical features (such as joint angles, limb velocities, and kinetic chain patterns) from motion data using Convolutional Neural Network Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM)-based models. These features are analyzed for relationships influencing stroke effectiveness and injury risk, forming the basis for feedback generation using large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the THETIS dataset and feature extraction techniques, our approach aims to produce feedback that is technically accurate, biomechanically grounded, and actionable for end-users. The experimental setup evaluates this framework on classification performance and interpretability, bridging the gap between explainable AI and sports biomechanics.

Abstract: While Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across general video understanding benchmarks-particularly in video captioning and descriptive tasks-they consistently underperform on tasks that require fine-grained temporal understanding. This limitation arises due to the lack of visual complexity and temporal nuance in current fine-tuning datasets, leading these models to rely heavily on language-based reasoning rather than truly understanding video dynamics. In this work, we propose TimeWarp, a systematic method to create a targeted synthetic temporal dataset to fine-tune the model's responses to encourage it to focus on the given input video. We introduce a large-scale preference dataset, created using TimeWarp, that captures intricate temporal dynamics often overlooked, grounding the model's responses to visual and temporal information. We demonstrate that when our method is applied to existing models, it significantly improves performance on temporal understanding benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed datasets in advancing temporal understanding in Video-LLMs, resulting in an absolute improvement in performance across seven benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/sameepv21/timewarp.

<title>No Tokens Wasted: Leveraging Long Context in Biomedical Vision-Language Models</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03978</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding vision-language models (VLMs) are typically pretrained with short text windows (<77 tokens), which forces the truncation of long-format captions. Yet, the distribution of biomedical captions from large-scale open source literature reveals that a huge portion of captions far exceed 77 tokens. To this end, we investigate the impact of pretraining on long-format biomedical captions by extending the context length of text encoders in VLMs. We find that longer context (thus, enabling additional supervision provided in long-format captions) correlates with better retrieval and classification performance. Given this finding, we introduce BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, a dataset of 1M image-caption pairs enriched with context-aware descriptions from full-text articles, providing longer and additional textual supervision. Using BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, we train BMC-LongCLIP, a long-context biomedical VLM with a text encoder supporting windows of up to 512 tokens. Our model extends context capacity by 6.6x, reducing token waste from 55% to just 2.2%. On long-caption retrieval benchmarks, BMC-LongCLIP achieves up to +30% absolute gains in Recall@1 and +2% average improvements in classification, while also converging faster than short-context. Our results demonstrate that long-context modeling is a promising direction for advancing biomedical VLMs.

<title>Keep It on a Leash: Controllable Pseudo-label Generation Towards Realistic Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03993</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current long-tailed semi-supervised learning methods assume that labeled data exhibit a long-tailed distribution, and unlabeled data adhere to a typical predefined distribution (i.e., long-tailed, uniform, or inverse long-tailed). However, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may follow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution. Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions. Additionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further improve the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to maximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples. Comprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that CPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up to \textbf{15.97\%} in accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/yaxinhou/CPG.

Abstract: Recognizing and processing Classical Chinese (Han-Nom) texts play a vital role in digitizing Vietnamese historical documents and enabling cross-lingual semantic research. However, existing OCR systems struggle with degraded scans, non-standard glyphs, and handwriting variations common in ancient sources. In this work, we propose a fine-tuning approach for PaddleOCRv5 to improve character recognition on Han-Nom texts. We retrain the text recognition module using a curated subset of ancient Vietnamese Chinese manuscripts, supported by a full training pipeline covering preprocessing, LMDB conversion, evaluation, and visualization. Experimental results show a significant improvement over the base model, with exact accuracy increasing from 37.5 percent to 50.0 percent, particularly under noisy image conditions. Furthermore, we develop an interactive demo that visually compares pre- and post-fine-tuning recognition results, facilitating downstream applications such as Han-Vietnamese semantic alignment, machine translation, and historical linguistics research. The demo is available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/MinhDS/Fine-tuned-PaddleOCRv5.

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have achieved remarkable successes in learning expressive yet compact signal representations. However, they are not naturally amenable to predictive tasks such as segmentation, where they must learn semantic structures over a distribution of signals. In this study, we introduce MetaSeg, a meta-learning framework to train INRs for medical image segmentation. MetaSeg uses an underlying INR that simultaneously predicts per pixel intensity values and class labels. It then uses a meta-learning procedure to find optimal initial parameters for this INR over a training dataset of images and segmentation maps, such that the INR can simply be fine-tuned to fit pixels of an unseen test image, and automatically decode its class labels. We evaluated MetaSeg on 2D and 3D brain MRI segmentation tasks and report Dice scores comparable to commonly used U-Net models, but with $90\%$ fewer parameters. MetaSeg offers a fresh, scalable alternative to traditional resource-heavy architectures such as U-Nets and vision transformers for medical image segmentation. Our project is available at https://kushalvyas.github.io/metaseg.html .

Abstract: We present \emph{Video-in-the-Loop} (ViTL), a two-stage long-video QA framework that preserves a fixed token budget by first \emph{localizing} question-relevant interval(s) with a low-fps skim and then \emph{answering} via span-aware reallocation of visual tokens at higher effective frame rate, emitting an interleaved output with both spans and the final option for direct attribution. We also introduce \dataname{}, which converts description based event graphs into \emph{span-grounded} multiple-choice QA by pairing each question with \emph{ground-truth} time span(s) and related reasoning. ViTL is trained end-to-end with an interleaved group-relative objective that couples temporal IoU for localization with answer correctness, allowing credit to flow from answers back to spans without increasing compute. Under fixed token budgets, ViTL attains up to 8.6% with 50% less frame input on long-video QA and temporal grounding (e.g., Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions) and ablations show that span-aware token reallocation consistently surpasses uniform sampling. Together, \dataname{} and ViTL provide an interpretable, compute-efficient recipe for scalable long-video QA.

<title>Enhancing Fake News Video Detection via LLM-Driven Creative Process Simulation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of fake news on short video platforms has become a new significant societal concern, necessitating automatic video-news-specific detection. Current detectors primarily rely on pattern-based features to separate fake news videos from real ones. However, limited and less diversified training data lead to biased patterns and hinder their performance. This weakness stems from the complex many-to-many relationships between video material segments and fabricated news events in real-world scenarios: a single video clip can be utilized in multiple ways to create different fake narratives, while a single fabricated event often combines multiple distinct video segments. However, existing datasets do not adequately reflect such relationships due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating large-scale real-world data, resulting in sparse coverage and non-comprehensive learning of the characteristics of potential fake news video creation. To address this issue, we propose a data augmentation framework, AgentAug, that generates diverse fake news videos by simulating typical creative processes. AgentAug implements multiple LLM-driven pipelines of four fabrication categories for news video creation, combined with an active learning strategy based on uncertainty sampling to select the potentially useful augmented samples during training. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that AgentAug consistently improves the performance of short video fake news detectors.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing have shifted from manual pixel manipulation to employing deep learning methods like stable diffusion models, which now leverage cross-attention mechanisms for text-driven control. This transition has simplified the editing process but also introduced variability in results, such as inconsistent hair color changes. Our research aims to enhance the precision and reliability of prompt-to-prompt image editing frameworks by exploring and optimizing hyperparameters. We present a comprehensive study of the "word swap" method, develop an "attention re-weight method" for better adaptability, and propose the "CL P2P" framework to address existing limitations like cycle inconsistency. This work contributes to understanding and improving the interaction between hyperparameter settings and the architectural choices of neural network models, specifically their attention mechanisms, which significantly influence the composition and quality of the generated images.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have markedly expanded the competence of graphical user-interface (GUI) systems, propelling them beyond controlled simulations into complex, real-world environments across diverse platforms. However, practical usefulness is still bounded by the reliability of visual grounding, i.e., mapping textual references to exact on-screen elements. This limitation prevents the system from accurately performing pointer-level actions such as clicking or dragging. To address it, we introduce GUI-Spotlight -- a model trained for image-grounded reasoning that dynamically invokes multiple specialized tools to iteratively narrow its focus to the relevant region of the screen, thereby substantially improving visual grounding accuracy. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Spotlight trained with only 18.5K training samples achieves 52.8\% accuracy, surpassing V2P-7B (50.6\% with 9.6M training samples) and GTA-1-7B (50.1\% with 1.56M training samples).

Abstract: Post-training quantization for reducing the storage of deep neural network models has been demonstrated to be an effective way in various tasks. However, low-bit quantization while maintaining model accuracy is a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a range estimation method to improve the quantization performance for post-training quantization. We model the range estimation into an optimization problem of minimizing quantization errors by layer-wise local minima. We prove this problem is locally convex and present an efficient search algorithm to find the optimal solution. We propose the application of the above search algorithm to the transformed weights space to do further improvement in practice. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art performance generally on top-1 accuracy for image classification tasks on the ResNet series models and Inception-v3 model. The experimental results show that the proposed method has almost no loss of top-1 accuracy in 8-bit and 6-bit settings for image classifications, and the accuracy of 4-bit quantization is also significantly improved.

Abstract: We present MetaFind, a scene-aware tri-modal compositional retrieval framework designed to enhance scene generation in the metaverse by retrieving 3D assets from large-scale repositories. MetaFind addresses two core challenges: (i) inconsistent asset retrieval that overlooks spatial, semantic, and stylistic constraints, and (ii) the absence of a standardized retrieval paradigm specifically tailored for 3D asset retrieval, as existing approaches mainly rely on general-purpose 3D shape representation models. Our key innovation is a flexible retrieval mechanism that supports arbitrary combinations of text, image, and 3D modalities as queries, enhancing spatial reasoning and style consistency by jointly modeling object-level features (including appearance) and scene-level layout structures. Methodologically, MetaFind introduces a plug-and-play equivariant layout encoder ESSGNN that captures spatial relationships and object appearance features, ensuring retrieved 3D assets are contextually and stylistically coherent with the existing scene, regardless of coordinate frame transformations. The framework supports iterative scene construction by continuously adapting retrieval results to current scene updates. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the improved spatial and stylistic consistency of MetaFind in various retrieval tasks compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: The prediction of solar flares is typically formulated as a binary classification task, distinguishing events as either Flare (FL) or No-Flare (NF) according to a specified threshold (for example, greater than or equal to C-class, M-class, or X-class). However, this binary framework neglects the inherent ordinal relationships among the sub-classes contained within each category (FL and NF). Several studies on solar flare prediction have empirically shown that the most frequent misclassifications occur near this prediction threshold. This suggests that the models struggle to differentiate events that are similar in intensity but fall on opposite sides of the binary threshold. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a modified loss function that integrates the ordinal information among the sub-classes of the binarized flare labels into the conventional binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss. This approach serves as an ordinality-aware, data-driven regularization method that penalizes the incorrect predictions of flare events in close proximity to the prediction threshold more heavily than those away from the boundary during model optimization. By incorporating ordinal weighting into the loss function, we aim to enhance the model's learning process by leveraging the ordinal characteristics of the data, thereby improving its overall performance.

<title>QuantDemoire: Quantization with Outlier Aware for Image Demoir\'eing</title>

Abstract: Demoir\'eing aims to remove moir\'e artifacts that often occur in images. While recent deep learning-based methods have achieved promising results, they typically require substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment on edge devices. Model quantization offers a compelling solution. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to demoir\'eing models introduces severe performance degradation. The main reasons are distribution outliers and weakened representations in smooth regions. To address these issues, we propose QuantDemoire, a post-training quantization framework tailored to demoir\'eing. It contains two key components. **First}, we introduce an outlier-aware quantizer to reduce errors from outliers. It uses sampling-based range estimation to reduce activation outliers, and keeps a few extreme weights in FP16 with negligible cost. **Second**, we design a frequency-aware calibration strategy. It emphasizes low- and mid-frequency components during fine-tuning, which mitigates banding artifacts caused by low-bit quantization. Extensive experiments validate that our QuantDemoire achieves large reductions in parameters and computation while maintaining quality. Meanwhile, it outperforms existing quantization methods by over **4 dB** on W4A4. Code is released at: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/QuantDemoire.

Abstract: This work presents TV-LoRA, a novel method for low-dose sparse-view CT reconstruction that combines a diffusion generative prior (NCSN++ with SDE modeling) and multi-regularization constraints, including anisotropic TV and nuclear norm (LoRA), within an ADMM framework. To address ill-posedness and texture loss under extremely sparse views, TV-LoRA integrates generative and physical constraints, and utilizes a 2D slice-based strategy with FFT acceleration and tensor-parallel optimization for efficient inference. Experiments on AAPM-2016, CTHD, and LIDC datasets with $N_{\mathrm{view}}=8,4,2$ show that TV-LoRA consistently surpasses benchmarks in SSIM, texture recovery, edge clarity, and artifact suppression, demonstrating strong robustness and generalizability. Ablation studies confirm the complementary effects of LoRA regularization and diffusion priors, while the FFT-PCG module provides a speedup. Overall, Diffusion + TV-LoRA achieves high-fidelity, efficient 3D CT reconstruction and broad clinical applicability in low-dose, sparse-sampling scenarios.

<title>TOPO-Bench: An Open-Source Topological Mapping Evaluation Framework with Quantifiable Perceptual Aliasing</title>

Abstract: Topological mapping offers a compact and robust representation for navigation, but progress in the field is hindered by the lack of standardized evaluation metrics, datasets, and protocols. Existing systems are assessed using different environments and criteria, preventing fair and reproducible comparisons. Moreover, a key challenge - perceptual aliasing - remains under-quantified, despite its strong influence on system performance. We address these gaps by (1) formalizing topological consistency as the fundamental property of topological maps and showing that localization accuracy provides an efficient and interpretable surrogate metric, and (2) proposing the first quantitative measure of dataset ambiguity to enable fair comparisons across environments. To support this protocol, we curate a diverse benchmark dataset with calibrated ambiguity levels, implement and release deep-learned baseline systems, and evaluate them alongside classical methods. Our experiments and analysis yield new insights into the limitations of current approaches under perceptual aliasing. All datasets, baselines, and evaluation tools are fully open-sourced to foster consistent and reproducible research in topological mapping.

<title>Learning Efficient Meshflow and Optical Flow from Event Cameras</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the problem of event-based meshflow estimation, a novel task that involves predicting a spatially smooth sparse motion field from event cameras. To start, we review the state-of-the-art in event-based flow estimation, highlighting two key areas for further research: i) the lack of meshflow-specific event datasets and methods, and ii) the underexplored challenge of event data density. First, we generate a large-scale High-Resolution Event Meshflow (HREM) dataset, which showcases its superiority by encompassing the merits of high resolution at 1280x720, handling dynamic objects and complex motion patterns, and offering both optical flow and meshflow labels. These aspects have not been fully explored in previous works. Besides, we propose Efficient Event-based MeshFlow (EEMFlow) network, a lightweight model featuring a specially crafted encoder-decoder architecture to facilitate swift and accurate meshflow estimation. Furthermore, we upgrade EEMFlow network to support dense event optical flow, in which a Confidence-induced Detail Completion (CDC) module is proposed to preserve sharp motion boundaries. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show the exceptional performance and runtime efficiency (30x faster) of our EEMFlow model compared to the recent state-of-the-art flow method. As an extension, we expand HREM into HREM+, a multi-density event dataset contributing to a thorough study of the robustness of existing methods across data with varying densities, and propose an Adaptive Density Module (ADM) to adjust the density of input event data to a more optimal range, enhancing the model's generalization ability. We empirically demonstrate that ADM helps to significantly improve the performance of EEMFlow and EEMFlow+ by 8% and 10%, respectively. Code and dataset are released at https://github.com/boomluo02/EEMFlowPlus.

<title>Joint Learning of Pose Regression and Denoising Diffusion with Score Scaling Sampling for Category-level 6D Pose Estimation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04125</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latest diffusion models have shown promising results in category-level 6D object pose estimation by modeling the conditional pose distribution with depth image input. The existing methods, however, suffer from slow convergence during training, learning its encoder with the diffusion denoising network in end-to-end fashion, and require an additional network that evaluates sampled pose hypotheses to filter out low-quality pose candidates. In this paper, we propose a novel pipeline that tackles these limitations by two key components. First, the proposed method pretrains the encoder with the direct pose regression head, and jointly learns the networks via the regression head and the denoising diffusion head, significantly accelerating training convergence while achieving higher accuracy. Second, sampling guidance via time-dependent score scaling is proposed s.t. the exploration-exploitation trade-off is effectively taken, eliminating the need for the additional evaluation network. The sampling guidance maintains multi-modal characteristics of symmetric objects at early denoising steps while ensuring high-quality pose generation at final steps. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks including REAL275, HouseCat6D, and ROPE, demonstrate that the proposed method, simple yet effective, achieves state-of-the-art accuracies even with single-pose inference, while being more efficient in both training and inference.

<title>Learning from All: Concept Alignment for Autonomous Distillation from Multiple Drifting MLLMs</title>

Abstract: This paper identifies a critical yet underexplored challenge in distilling from multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the reasoning trajectories generated by multiple drifting teachers exhibit concept drift, whereby their reasoning distributions evolve unpredictably and transmit biases to the student model, ultimately compromising its performance. To tackle this issue, we pioneer a theoretical connection between concept drift and knowledge distillation, casting the non-stationary reasoning dynamics from multiple MLLM teachers as next-token prediction of multi-stream reasoning trajectories.Guided by concept drift, we introduce the "learn, compare, critique" paradigm, culminating in autonomous preference optimization (APO). Under the active guidance of the teachers, the student model first learns and self-distils preferred thinking by comparing multiple teachers. It then engages in critical reflection over the drifting inference from teachers, performing concept alignment through APO, ultimately yielding a robust, consistent, and generalizable model.Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance of consistency, robustness and generalization within knowledge distillation. Besides, we also contributed a large-scale dataset, CXR-MAX (Multi-teachers Alignment X-rays), comprising 170,982 distilled reasoning trajectories derived from publicly accessible MLLMs based on MIMIC-CXR. Our code and data are public at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Autonomous-Distillation/.

Abstract: Conventional construction safety inspection methods are often inefficient as they require navigating through large volume of information. Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) provide opportunities to automate safety inspections through enhanced visual and linguistic understanding. However, existing applications face limitations including irrelevant or unspecific responses, restricted modal inputs and hallucinations. Utilisation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for this purpose is constrained by availability of training data and frequently lack real-time adaptability. This study introduces SiteShield, a multi-modal LVLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for automating construction safety inspection reports by integrating visual and audio inputs. Using real-world data, SiteShield outperformed unimodal LLMs without RAG with an F1 score of 0.82, hamming loss of 0.04, precision of 0.76, and recall of 0.96. The findings indicate that SiteShield offers a novel pathway to enhance information retrieval and efficiency in generating safety reports.

<title>BLADE: Bias-Linked Adaptive DEbiasing</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have revolutionized numerous fields, yet they remain vulnerable to a critical flaw: the tendency to learn implicit biases, spurious correlations between certain attributes and target labels in training data. These biases are often more prevalent and easier to learn, causing models to rely on superficial patterns rather than task-relevant features necessary for generalization. Existing methods typically rely on strong assumptions, such as prior knowledge of these biases or access to bias-conflicting samples, i.e., samples that contradict spurious correlations and counterbalance bias-aligned samples, samples that conform to these spurious correlations. However, such assumptions are often impractical in real-world settings. We propose BLADE ({B}ias-{L}inked {A}daptive {DE}biasing), a generative debiasing framework that requires no prior knowledge of bias or bias-conflicting samples. BLADE first trains a generative model to translate images across bias domains while preserving task-relevant features. Then, it adaptively refines each image with its synthetic counterpart based on the image's susceptibility to bias. To encourage robust representations, BLADE aligns an image with its bias-translated synthetic counterpart that shares task-relevant features but differs in bias, while misaligning it with samples sharing the same bias. We evaluate BLADE on multiple benchmark datasets and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it exceeds the closest baseline by an absolute margin of around 18% on the corrupted CIFAR-10 dataset under the worst group setting, establishing a new benchmark in bias mitigation and demonstrating its potential for developing more robust deep learning models without explicit supervision.

<title>From Segments to Concepts: Interpretable Image Classification via Concept-Guided Segmentation</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04180</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in computer vision; however, their black-box nature in decision-making limits interpretability and trust, particularly in safety-critical applications. Interpretability is crucial in domains where errors have severe consequences. Existing models not only lack transparency but also risk exploiting unreliable or misleading features, which undermines both robustness and the validity of their explanations. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to improve transparency by reasoning through human-interpretable concepts. Still, they require costly concept annotations and lack spatial grounding, often failing to identify which regions support each concept. We propose SEG-MIL-CBM, a novel framework that integrates concept-guided image segmentation into an attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) framework, where each segmented region is treated as an instance and the model learns to aggregate evidence across them. By reasoning over semantically meaningful regions aligned with high-level concepts, our model highlights task-relevant evidence, down-weights irrelevant cues, and produces spatially grounded, concept-level explanations without requiring annotations of concepts or groups. SEG-MIL-CBM achieves robust performance across settings involving spurious correlations (unintended dependencies between background and label), input corruptions (perturbations that degrade visual quality), and large-scale benchmarks, while providing transparent, concept-level explanations.

<title>Let Features Decide Their Own Solvers: Hybrid Feature Caching for Diffusion Transformers</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers offer state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video synthesis, but their iterative sampling process remains a major bottleneck due to the high cost of transformer forward passes at each timestep. To mitigate this, feature caching has emerged as a training-free acceleration technique that reuses or forecasts hidden representations. However, existing methods often apply a uniform caching strategy across all feature dimensions, ignoring their heterogeneous dynamic behaviors. Therefore, we adopt a new perspective by modeling hidden feature evolution as a mixture of ODEs across dimensions, and introduce HyCa, a Hybrid ODE solver inspired caching framework that applies dimension-wise caching strategies. HyCa achieves near-lossless acceleration across diverse domains and models, including 5.55 times speedup on FLUX, 5.56 times speedup on HunyuanVideo, 6.24 times speedup on Qwen-Image and Qwen-Image-Edit without retraining.

Abstract: While text-to-image (T2I) models can synthesize high-quality images, their performance degrades significantly when prompted with novel or out-of-distribution (OOD) entities due to inherent knowledge cutoffs. We introduce World-To-Image, a novel framework that bridges this gap by empowering T2I generation with agent-driven world knowledge. We design an agent that dynamically searches the web to retrieve images for concepts unknown to the base model. This information is then used to perform multimodal prompt optimization, steering powerful generative backbones toward an accurate synthesis. Critically, our evaluation goes beyond traditional metrics, utilizing modern assessments like LLMGrader and ImageReward to measure true semantic fidelity. Our experiments show that World-To-Image substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both semantic alignment and visual aesthetics, achieving +8.1% improvement in accuracy-to-prompt on our curated NICE benchmark. Our framework achieves these results with high efficiency in less than three iterations, paving the way for T2I systems that can better reflect the ever-changing real world. Our demo code is available here\footnote{https://github.com/mhson-kyle/World-To-Image}.

<title>MASC: Boosting Autoregressive Image Generation with a Manifold-Aligned Semantic Clustering</title>

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have shown great promise in image generation, yet they face a fundamental inefficiency stemming from their core component: a vast, unstructured vocabulary of visual tokens. This conventional approach treats tokens as a flat vocabulary, disregarding the intrinsic structure of the token embedding space where proximity often correlates with semantic similarity. This oversight results in a highly complex prediction task, which hinders training efficiency and limits final generation quality. To resolve this, we propose Manifold-Aligned Semantic Clustering (MASC), a principled framework that constructs a hierarchical semantic tree directly from the codebook's intrinsic structure. MASC employs a novel geometry-aware distance metric and a density-driven agglomerative construction to model the underlying manifold of the token embeddings. By transforming the flat, high-dimensional prediction task into a structured, hierarchical one, MASC introduces a beneficial inductive bias that significantly simplifies the learning problem for the AR model. MASC is designed as a plug-and-play module, and our extensive experiments validate its effectiveness: it accelerates training by up to 57% and significantly improves generation quality, reducing the FID of LlamaGen-XL from 2.87 to 2.58. MASC elevates existing AR frameworks to be highly competitive with state-of-the-art methods, establishing that structuring the prediction space is as crucial as architectural innovation for scalable generative modeling.

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI-generated imagery has blurred the boundary between real and synthetic content, raising critical concerns for digital integrity. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer interpretability through explanations but often fail to detect subtle artifacts in high-quality synthetic images. We propose ZoomIn, a two-stage forensic framework that improves both accuracy and interpretability. Mimicking human visual inspection, ZoomIn first scans an image to locate suspicious regions and then performs a focused analysis on these zoomed-in areas to deliver a grounded verdict. To support training, we introduce MagniFake, a dataset of 20,000 real and high-quality synthetic images annotated with bounding boxes and forensic explanations, generated through an automated VLM-based pipeline. Our method achieves 96.39% accuracy with robust generalization, while providing human-understandable explanations grounded in visual evidence.

Abstract: The problem of image registration is finding a transformation that aligns two images, such that the corresponding points are in the same location. This paper introduces a simple, end-to-end trainable algorithm that is implementable in a few lines of Python code. The approach is shown to work with very little training data and training time, while achieving accurate results in some settings. An example application to stereo vision was trained from 74 images on a 19x15 input window. With just a dozen lines of Python code this algorithm excels in brevity and may serve as a good start in related scenarios with limitations to training data, training time or code complexity.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are continually evolving, with some efforts aimed at improving accuracy, others at increasing speed, and some at enhancing accessibility. Improving accessibility broadens the application of neural networks across a wider range of tasks, including the detection of eye diseases. Early diagnosis of eye diseases and consulting an ophthalmologist can prevent many vision disorders. Given the importance of this issue, various datasets have been collected from the cornea to facilitate the process of making neural network models. However, most of the methods introduced in the past are computationally complex. In this study, we tried to increase the accessibility of deep neural network models. We did this at the most fundamental level, specifically by redesigning and optimizing the convolutional layers. By doing so, we created a new general model that incorporates our novel convolutional layer named ArConv layers. Thanks to the efficient performance of this new layer, the model has suitable complexity for use in mobile phones and can perform the task of diagnosing the presence of disease with high accuracy. The final model we present contains only 1.3 million parameters. In comparison to the MobileNetV2 model, which has 2.2 million parameters, our model demonstrated better accuracy when trained and evaluated on the RfMiD dataset under identical conditions, achieving an accuracy of 0.9328 versus 0.9266 on the RfMiD test set.

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a family of generative models designed for photorealistic, unified object- and scene-level neural rendering. Kaleido operates on the principle that 3D can be regarded as a specialised sub-domain of video, expressed purely as a sequence-to-sequence image synthesis task. Through a systemic study of scaling sequence-to-sequence generative neural rendering, we introduce key architectural innovations that enable our model to: i) perform generative view synthesis without explicit 3D representations; ii) generate any number of 6-DoF target views conditioned on any number of reference views via a masked autoregressive framework; and iii) seamlessly unify 3D and video modelling within a single decoder-only rectified flow transformer. Within this unified framework, Kaleido leverages large-scale video data for pre-training, which significantly improves spatial consistency and reduces reliance on scarce, camera-labelled 3D datasets -- all without any architectural modifications. Kaleido sets a new state-of-the-art on a range of view synthesis benchmarks. Its zero-shot performance substantially outperforms other generative methods in few-view settings, and, for the first time, matches the quality of per-scene optimisation methods in many-view settings.

<title>The best performance in the CARE 2025 -- Liver Task (LiSeg-Contrast): Contrast-Aware Semi-Supervised Segmentation with Domain Generalization and Test-Time Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Accurate liver segmentation from contrast-enhanced MRI is essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, it remains challenging due to limited annotated data, heterogeneous enhancement protocols, and significant domain shifts across scanners and institutions. Traditional image-to-image translation frameworks have made great progress in domain generalization, but their application is not straightforward. For example, Pix2Pix requires image registration, and cycle-GAN cannot be integrated seamlessly into segmentation pipelines. Meanwhile, these methods are originally used to deal with cross-modality scenarios, and often introduce structural distortions and suffer from unstable training, which may pose drawbacks in our single-modality scenario. To address these challenges, we propose CoSSeg-TTA, a compact segmentation framework for the GED4 (Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced hepatobiliary phase MRI) modality built upon nnU-Netv2 and enhanced with a semi-supervised mean teacher scheme to exploit large amounts of unlabeled volumes. A domain adaptation module, incorporating a randomized histogram-based style appearance transfer function and a trainable contrast-aware network, enriches domain diversity and mitigates cross-center variability. Furthermore, a continual test-time adaptation strategy is employed to improve robustness during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms the nnU-Netv2 baseline, achieving superior Dice score and Hausdorff Distance while exhibiting strong generalization to unseen domains under low-annotation conditions.

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a practical threat to deep learning models by forcing targeted misclassifications through localized perturbations, often realized in the physical world. Existing defenses typically assume prior knowledge of patch size or location, limiting their applicability. In this work, we propose a patch-agnostic defense that leverages concept-based explanations to identify and suppress the most influential concept activation vectors, thereby neutralizing patch effects without explicit detection. Evaluated on Imagenette with a ResNet-50, our method achieves higher robust and clean accuracy than the state-of-the-art PatchCleanser, while maintaining strong performance across varying patch sizes and locations. Our results highlight the promise of combining interpretability with robustness and suggest concept-driven defenses as a scalable strategy for securing machine learning models against adversarial patch attacks.

In practice, a transformer-based Seq-VPR model should be flexible to the number of frames per sequence (seq-length), deliver fast inference, and have low memory usage to meet real-time constraints. To our knowledge, no existing transformer-based Seq-VPR method achieves both flexibility and efficiency. To address this gap, we propose Adapt-STformer, a Seq-VPR method built around our novel Recurrent Deformable Transformer Encoder (Recurrent-DTE), which uses an iterative recurrent mechanism to fuse information from multiple sequential frames. This design naturally supports variable seq-lengths, fast inference, and low memory usage. Experiments on the Nordland, Oxford, and NuScenes datasets show that Adapt-STformer boosts recall by up to 17% while reducing sequence extraction time by 36% and lowering memory usage by 35% compared to the second-best baseline.

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have significantly advanced image editing and in-context image generation, yet a critical gap remains in ensuring physical consistency, where edited objects must remain coherent. This capability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this paper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a video generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images as the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large pretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but also the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal consistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that explicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, the target frame is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing trajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable transformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to avoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video. To validate ChronoEdit, we introduce PBench-Edit, a new benchmark of image-prompt pairs for contexts that require physical consistency, and demonstrate that ChronoEdit surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both visual fidelity and physical plausibility. Code and models for both the 14B and 2B variants of ChronoEdit will be released on the project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/chronoedit

Abstract: Objective gait assessment in Parkinson's Disease (PD) is limited by the absence of large, diverse, and clinically annotated motion datasets. We introduce CARE-PD, the largest publicly available archive of 3D mesh gait data for PD, and the first multi-site collection spanning 9 cohorts from 8 clinical centers. All recordings (RGB video or motion capture) are converted into anonymized SMPL meshes via a harmonized preprocessing pipeline. CARE-PD supports two key benchmarks: supervised clinical score prediction (estimating Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, UPDRS, gait scores) and unsupervised motion pretext tasks (2D-to-3D keypoint lifting and full-body 3D reconstruction). Clinical prediction is evaluated under four generalization protocols: within-dataset, cross-dataset, leave-one-dataset-out, and multi-dataset in-domain adaptation. To assess clinical relevance, we compare state-of-the-art motion encoders with a traditional gait-feature baseline, finding that encoders consistently outperform handcrafted features. Pretraining on CARE-PD reduces MPJPE (from 60.8mm to 7.5mm) and boosts PD severity macro-F1 by 17 percentage points, underscoring the value of clinically curated, diverse training data. CARE-PD and all benchmark code are released for non-commercial research at https://neurips2025.care-pd.ca/.

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) offers spatially resolved gene expression but remains costly. Predicting expression directly from widely available Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained images presents a cost-effective alternative. However, most computational approaches (i) predict each gene independently, overlooking co-expression structure, and (ii) cast the task as continuous regression despite expression being discrete counts. This mismatch can yield biologically implausible outputs and complicate downstream analyses. We introduce GenAR, a multi-scale autoregressive framework that refines predictions from coarse to fine. GenAR clusters genes into hierarchical groups to expose cross-gene dependencies, models expression as codebook-free discrete token generation to directly predict raw counts, and conditions decoding on fused histological and spatial embeddings. From an information-theoretic perspective, the discrete formulation avoids log-induced biases and the coarse-to-fine factorization aligns with a principled conditional decomposition. Extensive experimental results on four Spatial Transcriptomics datasets across different tissue types demonstrate that GenAR achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering potential implications for precision medicine and cost-effective molecular profiling. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/oyjr/genar.

Abstract: Imitation learning for end-to-end driving trains policies only on expert demonstrations. Once deployed in a closed loop, such policies lack recovery data: small mistakes cannot be corrected and quickly compound into failures. A promising direction is to generate alternative viewpoints and trajectories beyond the logged path. Prior work explores photorealistic digital twins via neural rendering or game engines, but these methods are prohibitively slow and costly, and thus mainly used for evaluation. In this work, we argue that photorealism is unnecessary for training end-to-end planners. What matters is semantic fidelity and scalability: driving depends on geometry and dynamics, not textures or lighting. Motivated by this, we propose 3D Rasterization, which replaces costly rendering with lightweight rasterization of annotated primitives, enabling augmentations such as counterfactual recovery maneuvers and cross-agent view synthesis. To transfer these synthetic views effectively to real-world deployment, we introduce a Raster-to-Real feature-space alignment that bridges the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components form Rasterization Augmented Planning (RAP), a scalable data augmentation pipeline for planning. RAP achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop robustness and long-tail generalization, ranking first on four major benchmarks: NAVSIM v1/v2, Waymo Open Dataset Vision-based E2E Driving, and Bench2Drive. Our results show that lightweight rasterization with feature alignment suffices to scale E2E training, offering a practical alternative to photorealistic rendering.

<title>Diffusion^2: Dual Diffusion Model with Uncertainty-Aware Adaptive Noise for Momentary Trajectory Prediction</title>

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and efficiency in autonomous driving and human-robot interaction scenarios. Earlier studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future trajectories. However, in real-world scenarios, such as pedestrians suddenly emerging from blind spots, sufficient observational data is often unavailable (i.e. momentary trajectory), making accurate prediction challenging and increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed Diffusion^2, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. Diffusion^2 consists of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for backward prediction, which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for forward prediction, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty and design a temporally adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, Diffusion^2 sets a new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford Drone datasets.

Abstract: World models that support controllable

  for robotics, enabling scalable training data, repro ducible evaluation, and flexible task design. While
  recent text-to-video models generate realistic dynam ics, they are constrained to 2D views and offer limited
  interaction. We introduce MorphoSim, a language guided framework that generates 4D scenes with
  multi-view consistency and object-level controls. From
  natural language instructions, MorphoSim produces
  dynamic environments where objects can be directed,
  recolored, or removed, and scenes can be observed
  from arbitrary viewpoints. The framework integrates
  trajectory-guided generation with feature field dis tillation, allowing edits to be applied interactively
  without full re-generation. Experiments show that Mor phoSim maintains high scene fidelity while enabling
  controllability and editability. The code is available

<title>Your Vision-Language Model Can't Even Count to 20: Exposing the Failures of VLMs in Compositional Counting</title>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become a central focus of today's AI community, owing to their impressive abilities gained from training on large-scale vision-language data from the Web. These models have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark, VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation. Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important directions for future research.

<title>CodeFormer++: Blind Face Restoration Using Deformable Registration and Deep Metric Learning</title>

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) has attracted increasing attention with the rise of generative methods. Most existing approaches integrate generative priors into the restoration pro- cess, aiming to jointly address facial detail generation and identity preservation. However, these methods often suffer from a trade-off between visual quality and identity fidelity, leading to either identity distortion or suboptimal degradation removal. In this paper, we present CodeFormer++, a novel framework that maximizes the utility of generative priors for high-quality face restoration while preserving identity. We decompose BFR into three sub-tasks: (i) identity- preserving face restoration, (ii) high-quality face generation, and (iii) dynamic fusion of identity features with realistic texture details. Our method makes three key contributions: (1) a learning-based deformable face registration module that semantically aligns generated and restored faces; (2) a texture guided restoration network to dynamically extract and transfer the texture of generated face to boost the quality of identity-preserving restored face; and (3) the integration of deep metric learning for BFR with the generation of informative positive and hard negative samples to better fuse identity- preserving and generative features. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that, the pro- posed CodeFormer++ achieves superior performance in terms of both visual fidelity and identity consistency.

Abstract: Effectively applying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to Video Question Answering (VideoQA) hinges on selecting a concise yet comprehensive set of frames, as processing entire videos is computationally infeasible. However, current frame selection methods face a critical trade-off: approaches relying on lightweight similarity models, such as CLIP, often fail to capture the nuances of complex queries, resulting in inaccurate similarity scores that cannot reflect the authentic query-frame relevance, which further undermines frame selection. Meanwhile, methods that leverage a VLM for deeper analysis achieve higher accuracy but incur prohibitive computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose A.I.R., a training-free approach for Adaptive, Iterative, and Reasoning-based frame selection. We leverage a powerful VLM to perform deep, semantic analysis on complex queries, and this analysis is deployed within a cost-effective iterative loop that processes only a small batch of the most high-potential frames at a time. Extensive experiments on various VideoQA benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing frame selection methods, significantly boosts the performance of the foundation VLM, and achieves substantial gains in computational efficiency over other VLM-based techniques.

<title>REAR: Rethinking Visual Autoregressive Models via Generator-Tokenizer Consistency Regularization</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual autoregressive (AR) generation offers a promising path toward unifying vision and language models, yet its performance remains suboptimal against diffusion models. Prior work often attributes this gap to tokenizer limitations and rasterization ordering. In this work, we identify a core bottleneck from the perspective of generator-tokenizer inconsistency, i.e., the AR-generated tokens may not be well-decoded by the tokenizer. To address this, we propose reAR, a simple training strategy introducing a token-wise regularization objective: when predicting the next token, the causal transformer is also trained to recover the visual embedding of the current token and predict the embedding of the target token under a noisy context. It requires no changes to the tokenizer, generation order, inference pipeline, or external models. Despite its simplicity, reAR substantially improves performance. On ImageNet, it reduces gFID from 3.02 to 1.86 and improves IS to 316.9 using a standard rasterization-based tokenizer. When applied to advanced tokenizers, it achieves a gFID of 1.42 with only 177M parameters, matching the performance with larger state-of-the-art diffusion models (675M).

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection segments objects with intrinsic similarity and edge disruption. Current detection methods rely on accumulated complex components. Each approach adds components such as boundary modules, attention mechanisms, and multi-scale processors independently. This accumulation creates a computational burden without proportional gains. To manage this complexity, they process at reduced resolutions, eliminating fine details essential for camouflage. We present SPEGNet, addressing fragmentation through a unified design. The architecture integrates multi-scale features via channel calibration and spatial enhancement. Boundaries emerge directly from context-rich representations, maintaining semantic-spatial alignment. Progressive refinement implements scale-adaptive edge modulation with peak influence at intermediate resolutions. This design strikes a balance between boundary precision and regional consistency. SPEGNet achieves 0.887 $S_\alpha$ on CAMO, 0.890 on COD10K, and 0.895 on NC4K, with real-time inference speed. Our approach excels across scales, from tiny, intricate objects to large, pattern-similar ones, while handling occlusion and ambiguous boundaries.

Abstract: Bridging clinical diagnostic reasoning with AI remains a central challenge in medical imaging. We introduce MedCLM, an automated pipeline that converts detection datasets into large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by linking lesion boxes to organ segmentation and structured rationales. These contextual signals enable medical vision-language models to generate question-answer pairs with step-by-step reasoning. To utilize this data effectively, we propose an Integrated CoT-Curriculum Strategy composed of an Easy stage with explicit lesion boxes for visual grounding, a Medium stage that encourages implicit localization, and a Hard stage for weakly supervised reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that MedCLM attains state-of-the-art performance on several medical VQA benchmarks, providing a scalable framework for developing clinically aligned medical vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved significant progress in multimodal understanding tasks, demonstrating strong capabilities particularly in general tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. However, when dealing with specialized cultural heritage domains like 3D vase artifacts, existing models face severe data scarcity issues and insufficient domain knowledge limitations. Due to the lack of targeted training data, current VLMs struggle to effectively handle such culturally significant specialized tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the VaseVQA-3D dataset, which serves as the first 3D visual question answering dataset for ancient Greek pottery analysis, collecting 664 ancient Greek vase 3D models with corresponding question-answer data and establishing a complete data construction pipeline. We further develop the VaseVLM model, enhancing model performance in vase artifact analysis through domain-adaptive training. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, where we improve by 12.8% on R@1 metrics and by 6.6% on lexical similarity compared with previous state-of-the-art on the VaseVQA-3D dataset, significantly improving the recognition and understanding of 3D vase artifacts, providing new technical pathways for digital heritage preservation research.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation and editing technologies have enabled state-of-the-art models to achieve impressive results in general domains. However, when applied to e-commerce scenarios, these general models often encounter consistency limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce TBStar-Edit, an new image editing model tailored for the e-commerce domain. Through rigorous data engineering, model architecture design and training strategy, TBStar-Edit achieves precise and high-fidelity image editing while maintaining the integrity of product appearance and layout. Specifically, for data engineering, we establish a comprehensive data construction pipeline, encompassing data collection, construction, filtering, and augmentation, to acquire high-quality, instruction-following, and strongly consistent editing data to support model training. For model architecture design, we design a hierarchical model framework consisting of a base model, pattern shifting modules, and consistency enhancement modules. For model training, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the consistency preservation: first stage for editing pattern shifting, and second stage for consistency enhancement. Each stage involves training different modules with separate datasets. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of TBStar-Edit on a self-proposed e-commerce benchmark, and the results demonstrate that TBStar-Edit outperforms existing general-domain editing models in both objective metrics (VIE Score) and subjective user preference.

<title>Asynchronous Denoising Diffusion Models for Aligning Text-to-Image Generation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generating high-quality images. Yet, they often struggle to faithfully align the generated images with the input prompts. This limitation arises from synchronous denoising, where all pixels simultaneously evolve from random noise to clear images. As a result, during generation, the prompt-related regions can only reference the unrelated regions at the same noise level, failing to obtain clear context and ultimately impairing text-to-image alignment. To address this issue, we propose asynchronous diffusion models -- a novel framework that allocates distinct timesteps to different pixels and reformulates the pixel-wise denoising process. By dynamically modulating the timestep schedules of individual pixels, prompt-related regions are denoised more gradually than unrelated regions, thereby allowing them to leverage clearer inter-pixel context. Consequently, these prompt-related regions achieve better alignment in the final images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our asynchronous diffusion models can significantly improve text-to-image alignment across diverse prompts. The code repository for this work is available at https://github.com/hu-zijing/AsynDM.

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve the state-of-the-art performance in image generation, but often suffer from semantic inconsistencies or hallucinations. While various inference-time guidance methods can enhance generation, they often operate indirectly by relying on external signals or architectural modifications, which introduces additional computational overhead. In this paper, we propose Tangential Amplifying Guidance (TAG), a more efficient and direct guidance method that operates solely on trajectory signals without modifying the underlying diffusion model. TAG leverages an intermediate sample as a projection basis and amplifies the tangential components of the estimated scores with respect to this basis to correct the sampling trajectory. We formalize this guidance process by leveraging a first-order Taylor expansion, which demonstrates that amplifying the tangential component steers the state toward higher-probability regions, thereby reducing inconsistencies and enhancing sample quality. TAG is a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic module that improves diffusion sampling fidelity with minimal computational addition, offering a new perspective on diffusion guidance.

Abstract: Conventional representation learning methods learn a universal representation that primarily captures dominant semantics, which may not always align with customized downstream tasks. For instance, in animal habitat analysis, researchers prioritize scene-related features, whereas universal embeddings emphasize categorical semantics, leading to suboptimal results. As a solution, existing approaches resort to supervised fine-tuning, which however incurs high computational and annotation costs. In this paper, we propose Conditional Representation Learning (CRL), aiming to extract representations tailored to arbitrary user-specified criteria. Specifically, we reveal that the semantics of a space are determined by its basis, thereby enabling a set of descriptive words to approximate the basis for a customized feature space. Building upon this insight, given a user-specified criterion, CRL first employs a large language model (LLM) to generate descriptive texts to construct the semantic basis, then projects the image representation into this conditional feature space leveraging a vision-language model (VLM). The conditional representation better captures semantics for the specific criterion, which could be utilized for multiple customized tasks. Extensive experiments on classification and retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority and generality of the proposed CRL. The code is available at https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2025-NeurIPS-CRL.

Abstract: Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process involving changes in magnification and movement between fields. Although recent pathology foundation models are strong, practical agentic systems that decide what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable diagnoses are still lacking. The blocker is data: scalable, clinically aligned supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not written in textbooks or online, and therefore absent from large language model training. We introduce the AI Session Recorder, which works with standard WSI viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs into standardized behavioral commands (inspect or peek at discrete magnifications) and bounding boxes. A lightweight human-in-the-loop review turns AI-drafted rationales into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired "where to look" and "why it matters" supervision produced at roughly six times lower labeling time. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathologist-o3, a two-stage agent that first proposes regions of interest and then performs behavior-guided reasoning. On gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection, it achieved 84.5% precision, 100.0% recall, and 75.4% accuracy, exceeding the state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our knowledge, this constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.

Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have achieved significant success in remote sensing Earth observation data analysis. Numerous feature fusion techniques address multimodal remote sensing image classification by integrating global and local features. However, these techniques often struggle to extract structural and detail features from heterogeneous and redundant multimodal images. With the goal of introducing frequency domain learning to model key and sparse detail features, this paper introduces the spatial-spectral-frequency interaction network (S$^2$Fin), which integrates pairwise fusion modules across the spatial, spectral, and frequency domains. Specifically, we propose a high-frequency sparse enhancement transformer that employs sparse spatial-spectral attention to optimize the parameters of the high-frequency filter. Subsequently, a two-level spatial-frequency fusion strategy is introduced, comprising an adaptive frequency channel module that fuses low-frequency structures with enhanced high-frequency details, and a high-frequency resonance mask that emphasizes sharp edges via phase similarity. In addition, a spatial-spectral attention fusion module further enhances feature extraction at intermediate layers of the network. Experiments on four benchmark multimodal datasets with limited labeled data demonstrate that S$^2$Fin performs superior classification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Detecting manipulated media has now become a pressing issue with the recent rise of deepfakes. Most existing approaches fail to generalize across diverse datasets and generation techniques. We thus propose a novel ensemble framework, combining the strengths of transformer-based architectures, such as Swin Transformers and ViTs, and texture-based methods, to achieve better detection accuracy and robustness. Our method introduces innovative data-splitting, sequential training, frequency splitting, patch-based attention, and face segmentation techniques to handle dataset imbalances, enhance high-impact regions (e.g., eyes and mouth), and improve generalization. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance when tested on the DFWild-Cup dataset, a diverse subset of eight deepfake datasets. The ensemble benefits from the complementarity of these approaches, with transformers excelling in global feature extraction and texturebased methods providing interpretability. This work demonstrates that hybrid models can effectively address the evolving challenges of deepfake detection, offering a robust solution for real-world applications.

<title>Do Superpixel Segmentation Methods Influence Deforestation Image Classification?</title>

Abstract: Image segmentation is a crucial step in various visual applications, including environmental monitoring through remote sensing. In the context of the ForestEyes project, which combines citizen science and machine learning to detect deforestation in tropical forests, image segments are used for labeling by volunteers and subsequent model training. Traditionally, the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm is adopted as the segmentation method. However, recent studies have indicated that other superpixel-based methods outperform SLIC in remote sensing image segmentation, and might suggest that they are more suitable for the task of detecting deforested areas. In this sense, this study investigated the impact of the four best segmentation methods, together with SLIC, on the training of classifiers for the target application. Initially, the results showed little variation in performance among segmentation methods, even when selecting the top five classifiers using the PyCaret AutoML library. However, by applying a classifier fusion approach (ensemble of classifiers), noticeable improvements in balanced accuracy were observed, highlighting the importance of both the choice of segmentation method and the combination of machine learning-based models for deforestation detection tasks.

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly integrated into education, virtual student agents are becoming vital for classroom simulation and teacher training. Yet their classroom-oriented subjective abilities remain largely unassessed, limiting understanding of model boundaries and hindering trustworthy deployment. We present EduPersona, a large-scale benchmark spanning two languages, three subjects, and ten persona types based on the Big Five theory. The dataset contains 1,308 authentic classroom dialogue rounds, corresponding to 12,814 teacher-student Q&amp;A turns, and is further expanded through persona stylization into roughly 10 times larger scale (128k turns), providing a solid foundation for evaluation. Building on this resource, we decompose hard-to-quantify subjective performance into three progressive tasks: TASK1 basic coherence (whether behavior, emotion, expression, and voice align with classroom context), TASK2 student realism, and TASK3 long-term persona consistency, thereby establishing an evaluation framework grounded in educational theory and research value. We conduct systematic experiments on three representative LLMs, comparing their original versions with ten persona-fine-tuned variants trained on EduPersona. Results show consistent and significant average improvements across all tasks: TASK1 +33.6%, TASK2 +30.6%, and TASK3 +14.9%. These improvements highlight the dataset's effectiveness and research value, while also revealing the heterogeneous difficulty of persona modeling. In summary, EduPersona delivers the first classroom benchmark centered on subjective abilities, establishes a decoupled and verifiable research paradigm, and we will open-source both the dataset and the framework to support the broader research community in advancing trustworthy and human-like AI for education.

Abstract: Gait encodes rich biometric and behavioural information, yet leveraging the manner of walking to infer psychological traits remains a challenging and underexplored problem. We introduce a hierarchical Multi-Stage Mixture of Movement Experts (MoME) architecture for multi-task prediction of psychological attributes from gait sequences represented as 2D poses. MoME processes the walking cycle in four stages of movement complexity, employing lightweight expert models to extract spatio-temporal features and task-specific gating modules to adaptively weight experts across traits and stages. Evaluated on the PsyMo benchmark covering 17 psychological traits, our method outperforms state-of-the-art gait analysis models, achieving a 37.47% weighted F1 score at the run level and 44.6% at the subject level. Our experiments show that integrating auxiliary tasks such as identity recognition, gender prediction, and BMI estimation further improves psychological trait estimation. Our findings demonstrate the viability of multi-task gait-based learning for psychological trait estimation and provide a foundation for future research on movement-informed psychological inference.

<title>ConceptSplit: Decoupled Multi-Concept Personalization of Diffusion Models via Token-wise Adaptation and Attention Disentanglement</title>

Abstract: In recent years, multi-concept personalization for text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to represent several subjects in an image has gained much more attention. The main challenge of this task is "concept mixing", where multiple learned concepts interfere or blend undesirably in the output image. To address this issue, in this paper, we present ConceptSplit, a novel framework to split the individual concepts through training and inference. Our framework comprises two key components. First, we introduce Token-wise Value Adaptation (ToVA), a merging-free training method that focuses exclusively on adapting the value projection in cross-attention. Based on our empirical analysis, we found that modifying the key projection, a common approach in existing methods, can disrupt the attention mechanism and lead to concept mixing. Second, we propose Latent Optimization for Disentangled Attention (LODA), which alleviates attention entanglement during inference by optimizing the input latent. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that ConceptSplit achieves robust multi-concept personalization, mitigating unintended concept interference.

Abstract: Accurate liver segmentation in multi-phase MRI is vital for liver fibrosis assessment, yet labeled data is often scarce and unevenly distributed across imaging modalities and vendor systems. We propose a label-efficient segmentation approach that promotes cross-modality generalization under real-world conditions, where GED4 hepatobiliary-phase annotations are limited, non-contrast sequences (T1WI, T2WI, DWI) are unlabeled, and spatial misalignment and missing phases are common. Our method integrates a foundation-scale 3D segmentation backbone adapted via fine-tuning, co-training with cross pseudo supervision to leverage unlabeled volumes, and a standardized preprocessing pipeline. Without requiring spatial registration, the model learns to generalize across MRI phases and vendors, demonstrating robust segmentation performance in both labeled and unlabeled domains. Our results exhibit the effectiveness of our proposed label-efficient baseline for liver segmentation in multi-phase, multi-vendor MRI and highlight the potential of combining foundation model adaptation with co-training for real-world clinical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Human-centric generative models designed for AI-driven storytelling must bring together two core capabilities: identity consistency and precise control over human performance. While recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant progress in maintaining facial identity, achieving fine-grained expression control without compromising identity remains challenging. In this work, we present a diffusion-based framework that faithfully reimagines any subject under any particular facial expression. Building on an ID-consistent face foundation model, we adopt a compositional design featuring an expression cross-attention module guided by FLAME blendshape parameters for explicit control. Trained on a diverse mixture of image and video data rich in expressive variation, our adapter generalizes beyond basic emotions to subtle micro-expressions and expressive transitions, overlooked by prior works. In addition, a pluggable Reference Adapter enables expression editing in real images by transferring the appearance from a reference frame during synthesis. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our model outperforms existing methods in tailored and identity-consistent expression generation.

Abstract: The automatic generation of diverse and human-like facial reactions in dyadic dialogue remains a critical challenge for human-computer interaction systems. Existing methods fail to model the stochasticity and dynamics inherent in real human reactions. To address this, we propose ReactDiff, a novel temporal diffusion framework for generating diverse facial reactions that are appropriate for responding to any given dialogue context. Our key insight is that plausible human reactions demonstrate smoothness, and coherence over time, and conform to constraints imposed by human facial anatomy. To achieve this, ReactDiff incorporates two vital priors (spatio-temporal facial kinematics) into the diffusion process: i) temporal facial behavioral kinematics and ii) facial action unit dependencies. These two constraints guide the model toward realistic human reaction manifolds, avoiding visually unrealistic jitters, unstable transitions, unnatural expressions, and other artifacts. Extensive experiments on the REACT2024 dataset demonstrate that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art reaction quality but also excels in diversity and reaction appropriateness.

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Graph Prediction aims to detect objects and their semantic relationships in 3D scenes, and has emerged as a crucial technology for robotics and AR/VR applications. While previous research has addressed dataset limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings, they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction. Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics. Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction. Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/VisualScienceLab-KHU/OCRL-3DSSG-Codes.

Abstract: Camera traps are widely used for wildlife monitoring, but extracting accurate distance measurements from monocular images remains challenging due to the lack of depth information. While monocular depth estimation (MDE) methods have advanced significantly, their performance in natural wildlife environments has not been systematically evaluated. This work introduces the first benchmark for monocular metric depth estimation in wildlife monitoring conditions. We evaluate four state-of-the-art MDE methods (Depth Anything V2, ML Depth Pro, ZoeDepth, and Metric3D) alongside a geometric baseline on 93 camera trap images with ground truth distances obtained using calibrated ChARUCO patterns. Our results demonstrate that Depth Anything V2 achieves the best overall performance with a mean absolute error of 0.454m and correlation of 0.962, while methods like ZoeDepth show significant degradation in outdoor natural environments (MAE: 3.087m). We find that median-based depth extraction consistently outperforms mean-based approaches across all deep learning methods. Additionally, we analyze computational efficiency, with ZoeDepth being fastest (0.17s per image) but least accurate, while Depth Anything V2 provides an optimal balance of accuracy and speed (0.22s per image). This benchmark establishes performance baselines for wildlife applications and provides practical guidance for implementing depth estimation in conservation monitoring systems.

Abstract: Quantifying sponsor visibility in sports broadcasts is a critical marketing task traditionally hindered by manual, subjective, and unscalable analysis methods. While automated systems offer an alternative, their reliance on axis-aligned Horizontal Bounding Box (HBB) leads to inaccurate exposuremetrics when logos appear rotated or skewed due to dynamic camera angles and perspective distortions. This paper introduces ExposureEngine, an end-to-end system designed for accurate, rotation-aware sponsor visibility analytics in sports broadcasts, demonstrated in a soccer case study. Our approach predicts Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) to provide a geometrically precise fit to each logo regardless of the orientation on-screen. To train and evaluate our detector, we developed a new dataset comprising 1,103 frames from Swedish elite soccer, featuring 670 unique sponsor logos annotated with OBBs. Our model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.859, with a precision of 0.96 and recall of 0.87, demonstrating robust performance in localizing logos under diverse broadcast conditions. The system integrates these detections into an analytical pipeline that calculates precise visibility metrics, such as exposure duration and on-screen coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate a language-driven agentic layer, enabling users to generate reports, summaries, and media content through natural language queries. The complete system, including the dataset and the analytics dashboard, provides a comprehensive solution for auditable and interpretable sponsor measurement in sports media. An overview of the ExposureEngine is available online: https://youtu.be/tRw6OBISuW4 .

<title>Anomaly-Aware YOLO: A Frugal yet Robust Approach to Infrared Small Target Detection</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) is a challenging task in defense applications, where complex backgrounds and tiny target sizes often result in numerous false alarms using conventional object detectors. To overcome this limitation, we propose Anomaly-Aware YOLO (AA-YOLO), which integrates a statistical anomaly detection test into its detection head. By treating small targets as unexpected patterns against the background, AA-YOLO effectively controls the false alarm rate. Our approach not only achieves competitive performance on several IRSTD benchmarks, but also demonstrates remarkable robustness in scenarios with limited training data, noise, and domain shifts. Furthermore, since only the detection head is modified, our design is highly generic and has been successfully applied across various YOLO backbones, including lightweight models. It also provides promising results when integrated into an instance segmentation YOLO. This versatility makes AA-YOLO an attractive solution for real-world deployments where resources are constrained. The code will be publicly released.

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of transformer-based architectures for person identification in natural, face-to-face conversation scenario. We implement and evaluate a two-stream framework that separately models spatial configurations and temporal motion patterns of 133 COCO WholeBody keypoints, extracted from a subset of the CANDOR conversational corpus. Our experiments compare pre-trained and from-scratch training, investigate the use of velocity features, and introduce a multi-scale temporal transformer for hierarchical motion modeling. Results demonstrate that domain-specific training significantly outperforms transfer learning, and that spatial configurations carry more discriminative information than temporal dynamics. The spatial transformer achieves 95.74% accuracy, while the multi-scale temporal transformer achieves 93.90%. Feature-level fusion pushes performance to 98.03%, confirming that postural and dynamic information are complementary. These findings highlight the potential of transformer architectures for person identification in natural interactions and provide insights for future multimodal and cross-cultural studies.

Abstract: The 3D occupancy prediction task has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, playing a crucial role in vision-based autonomous driving systems. While traditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches have moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary text queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in text-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to capture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs significant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present PG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables open-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive online densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D Gaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively enhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and detailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of an anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which adaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and stages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene information capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement over the previous best performing method. Code and pretrained models will be released upon publication on our project page: https://yanchi-3dv.github.io/PG-Occ

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.04770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary learning requires modeling the data distribution in open environments, which consists of both seen-class and unseen-class data.
  Existing methods estimate the distribution in open environments using seen-class data, where the absence of unseen classes makes the estimation error inherently unidentifiable.
  Intuitively, learning beyond the seen classes is crucial for distribution estimation to bound the estimation error.
  We theoretically demonstrate that the distribution can be effectively estimated by generating unseen-class data, through which the estimation error is upper-bounded.
  Building on this theoretical insight, we propose a novel open-vocabulary learning method, which generates unseen-class data for estimating the distribution in open environments. The method consists of a class-domain-wise data generation pipeline and a distribution alignment algorithm. The data generation pipeline generates unseen-class data under the guidance of a hierarchical semantic tree and domain information inferred from the seen-class data, facilitating accurate distribution estimation. With the generated data, the distribution alignment algorithm estimates and maximizes the posterior probability to enhance generalization in open-vocabulary learning. Extensive experiments on $11$ datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches by up to $14\%$, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.

arXiv:2510.04772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The FedSurg challenge was designed to benchmark the state of the art in federated learning for surgical video classification. Its goal was to assess how well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt through local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development without sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to classify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the multi-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks: generalization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after fine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear probing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes (FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and Expected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and statistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across centers was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after fine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission achieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted limitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties in hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal modeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies. Conclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for evaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight the trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and underscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss design. This benchmarking offers a reference point for future development of imbalance-aware, adaptive, and robust FL methods in clinical surgical AI.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D scanning is essential for preserving cultural heritage artefacts, supporting documentation, analysis, and long-term conservation. However, conventional methods typically require specialized expertise and manual intervention to maintain optimal scanning conditions and coverage. We present an automated two-robot scanning system that eliminates the need for handheld or semi-automatic workflows by combining coordinated robotic manipulation with high-resolution 3D scanning. Our system parameterizes the scanning space into distinct regions, enabling coordinated motion planning between a scanner-equipped robot and a tray-handling robot. Optimized trajectory planning and waypoint distribution ensure comprehensive surface coverage, minimize occlusions, and balance reconstruction accuracy with system efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significantly lower Chamfer Distance and higher F-score compared to baseline methods, offering superior geometric accuracy, improved digitization efficiency, and reduced reliance on expert operators.

<title>A Comparative Study of Vision Transformers and CNNs for Few-Shot Rigid Transformation and Fundamental Matrix Estimation</title>

Abstract: Vision-transformers (ViTs) and large-scale convolution-neural-networks (CNNs) have reshaped computer vision through pretrained feature representations that enable strong transfer learning for diverse tasks. However, their efficiency as backbone architectures for geometric estimation tasks involving image deformations in low-data regimes remains an open question. This work considers two such tasks: 1) estimating 2D rigid transformations between pairs of images and 2) predicting the fundamental matrix for stereo image pairs, an important problem in various applications, such as autonomous mobility, robotics, and 3D scene reconstruction. Addressing this intriguing question, this work systematically compares large-scale CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, CLIP-ResNet) with ViT-based foundation models (CLIP-ViT variants and DINO) in various data size settings, including few-shot scenarios. These pretrained models are optimized for classification or contrastive learning, encouraging them to focus mostly on high-level semantics. The considered tasks require balancing local and global features differently, challenging the straightforward adoption of these models as the backbone. Empirical comparative analysis shows that, similar to training from scratch, ViTs outperform CNNs during refinement in large downstream-data scenarios. However, in small data scenarios, the inductive bias and smaller capacity of CNNs improve their performance, allowing them to match that of a ViT. Moreover, ViTs exhibit stronger generalization in cross-domain evaluation where the data distribution changes. These results emphasize the importance of carefully selecting model architectures for refinement, motivating future research towards hybrid architectures that balance local and global representations.

Abstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce has intensified the demand for Virtual Try-On (VTO) technologies, enabling customers to realistically visualize products overlaid on their own images. Despite recent advances, existing VTO models face challenges with fine-grained detail preservation, robustness to real-world imagery, efficient sampling, image editing capabilities, and generalization across diverse product categories. In this paper, we present DiT-VTON, a novel VTO framework that leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), renowned for its performance on text-conditioned image generation, adapted here for the image-conditioned VTO task. We systematically explore multiple DiT configurations, including in-context token concatenation, channel concatenation, and ControlNet integration, to determine the best setup for VTO image conditioning.
  To enhance robustness, we train the model on an expanded dataset encompassing varied backgrounds, unstructured references, and non-garment categories, demonstrating the benefits of data scaling for VTO adaptability. DiT-VTON also redefines the VTO task beyond garment try-on, offering a versatile Virtual Try-All (VTA) solution capable of handling a wide range of product categories and supporting advanced image editing functionalities such as pose preservation, localized editing, texture transfer, and object-level customization. Experimental results show that our model surpasses state-of-the-art methods on VITON-HD, achieving superior detail preservation and robustness without reliance on additional condition encoders. It also outperforms models with VTA and image editing capabilities on a diverse dataset spanning thousands of product categories.

Abstract: Observing surgical practice has historically relied on fixed vantage points or recollections, leaving the egocentric visual perspectives that guide clinical decisions undocumented. Fixed-camera video can capture surgical workflows at the room-scale, but cannot reconstruct what each team member actually saw. Thus, these videos only provide limited insights into how decisions that affect surgical safety, training, and workflow optimization are made. Here we introduce EgoSurg, the first framework to reconstruct the dynamic, egocentric replays for any operating room (OR) staff directly from wall-mounted fixed-camera video, and thus, without intervention to clinical workflow. EgoSurg couples geometry-driven neural rendering with diffusion-based view enhancement, enabling high-visual fidelity synthesis of arbitrary and egocentric viewpoints at any moment. In evaluation across multi-site surgical cases and controlled studies, EgoSurg reconstructs person-specific visual fields and arbitrary viewpoints with high visual quality and fidelity. By transforming existing OR camera infrastructure into a navigable dynamic 3D record, EgoSurg establishes a new foundation for immersive surgical data science, enabling surgical practice to be visualized, experienced, and analyzed from every angle.

Abstract: Despite interpretability work analyzing VIT encoders and transformer activations, we don't yet understand why Multimodal Language Models (MLMs) struggle on perception-heavy tasks. We offer an under-studied perspective by examining how popular MLMs (LLaVA-OneVision, Qwen2.5-VL, and Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT) process their visual key-value tokens. We first study the flow of visual information through the language model, finding that image value tokens encode sufficient information to perform several perception-heavy tasks zero-shot: segmentation, semantic correspondence, temporal correspondence, and referring expression detection. We find that while the language model does augment the visual information received from the projection of input visual encodings-which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability-it contains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual encoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that the visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in later layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception capability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information in the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input improves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal that if language models were able to better control their visual information, their perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style questions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the language model is not surfaced to the output! Our findings reveal insights into the role of key-value tokens in multimodal systems, paving the way for deeper mechanistic interpretability of MLMs and suggesting new directions for training their visual encoder and language model components.

Abstract: We propose AvatarVTON, the first 4D virtual try-on framework that generates realistic try-on results from a single in-shop garment image, enabling free pose control, novel-view rendering, and diverse garment choices. Unlike existing methods, AvatarVTON supports dynamic garment interactions under single-view supervision, without relying on multi-view garment captures or physics priors. The framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Reciprocal Flow Rectifier, a prior-free optical-flow correction strategy that stabilizes avatar fitting and ensures temporal coherence; and (2) a Non-Linear Deformer, which decomposes Gaussian maps into view-pose-invariant and view-pose-specific components, enabling adaptive, non-linear garment deformations. To establish a benchmark for 4D virtual try-on, we extend existing baselines with unified modules for fair qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Extensive experiments show that AvatarVTON achieves high fidelity, diversity, and dynamic garment realism, making it well-suited for AR/VR, gaming, and digital-human applications.

Abstract: Generating synthetic CT (sCT) from MRI or CBCT plays a crucial role in enabling MRI-only and CBCT-based adaptive radiotherapy, improving treatment precision while reducing patient radiation exposure. To address this task, we adopt a fully 3D Flow Matching (FM) framework, motivated by recent work demonstrating FM's efficiency in producing high-quality images. In our approach, a Gaussian noise volume is transformed into an sCT image by integrating a learned FM velocity field, conditioned on features extracted from the input MRI or CBCT using a lightweight 3D encoder. We evaluated the method on the SynthRAD2025 Challenge benchmark, training separate models for MRI $\rightarrow$ sCT and CBCT $\rightarrow$ sCT across three anatomical regions: abdomen, head and neck, and thorax. Validation and testing were performed through the challenge submission system. The results indicate that the method accurately reconstructs global anatomical structures; however, preservation of fine details was limited, primarily due to the relatively low training resolution imposed by memory and runtime constraints. Future work will explore patch-based training and latent-space flow models to improve resolution and local structural fidelity.

<title>Beyond Random: Automatic Inner-loop Optimization in Dataset Distillation</title>

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient deep learning has positioned dataset distillation as a pivotal technique for compressing training dataset while preserving model performance. However, existing inner-loop optimization methods for dataset distillation typically rely on random truncation strategies, which lack flexibility and often yield suboptimal results. In this work, we observe that neural networks exhibit distinct learning dynamics across different training stages-early, middle, and late-making random truncation ineffective. To address this limitation, we propose Automatic Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (AT-BPTT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts both truncation positions and window sizes according to intrinsic gradient behavior. AT-BPTT introduces three key components: (1) a probabilistic mechanism for stage-aware timestep selection, (2) an adaptive window sizing strategy based on gradient variation, and (3) a low-rank Hessian approximation to reduce computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that AT-BPTT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving accuracy by an average of 6.16% over baseline methods. Moreover, our approach accelerates inner-loop optimization by 3.9x while saving 63% memory cost.

Abstract: An accurate and up-to-date model of a photovoltaic (PV) power plant is essential for its optimal operation and maintenance. However, such a model may not be easily available. This work introduces a novel approach for PV power plant mapping based on aerial overview images. It enables the automation of the mapping process while removing the reliance on third-party data. The presented mapping method takes advantage of the structural layout of the power plants to achieve detailed modeling down to the level of individual PV modules. The approach relies on visual segmentation of PV modules in overview images and the inference of structural information in each image, assigning modules to individual benches, rows, and columns. We identify visual keypoints related to the layout and use these to merge detections from multiple images while maintaining their structural integrity. The presented method was experimentally verified and evaluated on two different power plants. The final fusion of 3D positions and semantic structures results in a compact georeferenced model suitable for power plant maintenance.

<title>From Actions to Kinesics: Extracting Human Psychological States through Bodily Movements</title>

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic relationship between humans and the built environment is a key challenge in disciplines ranging from environmental psychology to reinforcement learning (RL). A central obstacle in modeling these interactions is the inability to capture human psychological states in a way that is both generalizable and privacy preserving. Traditional methods rely on theoretical models or questionnaires, which are limited in scope, static, and labor intensive. We present a kinesics recognition framework that infers the communicative functions of human activity -- known as kinesics -- directly from 3D skeleton joint data. Combining a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) with a convolutional neural network (CNN), the framework leverages transfer learning to bypass the need for manually defined mappings between physical actions and psychological categories. The approach preserves user anonymity while uncovering latent structures in bodily movements that reflect cognitive and emotional states. Our results on the Dyadic User EngagemenT (DUET) dataset demonstrate that this method enables scalable, accurate, and human-centered modeling of behavior, offering a new pathway for enhancing RL-driven simulations of human-environment interaction.

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) integrate sensing, computing, and control to improve infrastructure performance, focusing on economic goals like performance and safety. However, they often neglect potential human-centered (or ''social'') benefits. Cyber-physical-social infrastructure systems (CPSIS) aim to address this by aligning CPS with social objectives. This involves defining social benefits, understanding human interactions with each other and infrastructure, developing privacy-preserving measurement methods, modeling these interactions for prediction, linking them to social benefits, and actuating the physical environment to foster positive social outcomes. This paper delves into recognizing dyadic human interactions using real-world data, which is the backbone to measuring social behavior. This lays a foundation to address the need to enhance understanding of the deeper meanings and mutual responses inherent in human interactions. While RGB cameras are informative for interaction recognition, privacy concerns arise. Depth sensors offer a privacy-conscious alternative by analyzing skeletal movements. This study compares five skeleton-based interaction recognition algorithms on a dataset of 12 dyadic interactions. Unlike single-person datasets, these interactions, categorized into communication types like emblems and affect displays, offer insights into the cultural and emotional aspects of human interactions.

Abstract: Although deep neural networks and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image classification with relatively high efficiency, they still exhibit high computational costs, often rendering them impractical for real-time and edge applications. Therefore, a multitude of compression techniques have been developed to reduce these costs while maintaining accuracy. In addition, dynamic architectures have been introduced to modulate the level of compression at execution time, which is a desirable property in many resource-limited application scenarios. The proposed method effectively integrates two well-established optimization techniques: early exits and knowledge distillation, where a reduced student early-exit model is trained from a more complex teacher early-exit model. The primary contribution of this research lies in the approach for training the student early-exit model. In comparison to the conventional Knowledge Distillation loss, our approach incorporates a new entropy-based loss for images where the teacher's classification was incorrect. The proposed method optimizes the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, thereby achieving significant reductions in computational complexity without compromising classification performance. The validity of this approach is substantiated by experimental results on image classification datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN, which further opens new research perspectives for Knowledge Distillation in other contexts.

<title>\mu DeepIQA: deep learning-based fast and robust image quality assessment with local predictions for optical microscopy</title>

Abstract: Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques in research studies for life sciences and biomedicine. These applications require reliable experimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples and must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct processing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with variable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward implementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when evaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for well-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal domain.
  To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based IQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability and fast prediction. Our method, named $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA, is inspired by previous studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for IQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same architecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores for optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable predictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside the ideal range of standard methods. In addition, $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA provides patch-wise prediction of image quality and can be used to visualize spatially varying quality in a single image. Our study demonstrates that optical microscopy-based studies can benefit from the generalizability of deep learning models due to their stable performance in the presence of outliers, the ability to assess small image patches, and rapid predictions.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end, IoT-enabled robotic system for the non-destructive, real-time, and spatially-resolved mapping of grape yield and quality (Brix, Acidity) in vineyards. The system features a comprehensive analytical pipeline that integrates two key modules: a high-performance model for grape bunch detection and weight estimation, and a novel deep learning framework for quality assessment from hyperspectral (HSI) data. A critical barrier to in-field HSI is the ``domain shift" caused by variable illumination. To overcome this, our quality assessment is powered by the Light-Invariant Spectral Autoencoder (LISA), a domain-adversarial framework that learns illumination-invariant features from uncalibrated data. We validated the system's robustness on a purpose-built HSI dataset spanning three distinct illumination domains: controlled artificial lighting (lab), and variable natural sunlight captured in the morning and afternoon. Results show the complete pipeline achieves a recall (0.82) for bunch detection and a $R^2$ (0.76) for weight prediction, while the LISA module improves quality prediction generalization by over 20% compared to the baselines. By combining these robust modules, the system successfully generates high-resolution, georeferenced data of both grape yield and quality, providing actionable, data-driven insights for precision viticulture.

Abstract: Benthic habitat mapping is fundamental for understanding marine ecosystems, guiding conservation efforts, and supporting sustainable resource management. Yet, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets limits the development and benchmarking of machine learning models in this domain. This paper introduces a thorough multi-modal dataset, comprising about a million side-scan sonar (SSS) tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Approximately \num{36000} of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable supervised fine-tuning of classification models. All the raw sensor data, together with mosaics, are also released to support further exploration and algorithm development. To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles, facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance accessibility and encourage research. This resource aims to establish a standardized benchmark for underwater habitat mapping, promoting advancements in autonomous seafloor classification and multi-sensor integration.

This study compares four object detection models--YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, SSD, and RetinaNet--for motorbike detection using a custom dataset of 198 images collected in Kigali. Implemented in PyTorch with transfer learning, the models were evaluated for accuracy, localization, and inference speed to assess their suitability for real-time navigation in resource-constrained settings. We identify implementation challenges, including dataset limitations and model complexities, and recommend simplified architectures for future work to enhance accessibility for autonomous systems in developing countries like Rwanda.

<title>A Semantics-Aware Hierarchical Self-Supervised Approach to Classification of Remote Sensing Images</title>

Abstract: Deep learning has become increasingly important in remote sensing image classification due to its ability to extract semantic information from complex data. Classification tasks often include predefined label hierarchies that represent the semantic relationships among classes. However, these hierarchies are frequently overlooked, and most approaches focus only on fine-grained classification schemes. In this paper, we present a novel Semantics-Aware Hierarchical Consensus (SAHC) method for learning hierarchical features and relationships by integrating hierarchy-specific classification heads within a deep network architecture, each specialized in different degrees of class granularity. The proposed approach employs trainable hierarchy matrices, which guide the network through the learning of the hierarchical structure in a self-supervised manner. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical consensus mechanism to ensure consistent probability distributions across different hierarchical levels. This mechanism acts as a weighted ensemble being able to effectively leverage the inherent structure of the hierarchical classification task. The proposed SAHC method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets with different degrees of hierarchical complexity on different tasks, using distinct backbone architectures to effectively emphasize its adaptability. Experimental results show both the effectiveness of the proposed approach in guiding network learning and the robustness of the hierarchical consensus for remote sensing image classification tasks.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have significantly contributed to scalable machine learning by enabling specialized subnetworks to tackle complex tasks efficiently. However, traditional MoE systems lack domain-specific constraints essential for medical imaging, where anatomical structure and regional disease heterogeneity strongly influence pathological patterns. Here, we introduce Regional Expert Networks (REN), the first anatomically-informed MoE framework tailored specifically for medical image classification. REN leverages anatomical priors to train seven specialized experts, each dedicated to distinct lung lobes and bilateral lung combinations, enabling precise modeling of region-specific pathological variations. Multi-modal gating mechanisms dynamically integrate radiomics biomarkers and deep learning (DL) features (CNN, ViT, Mamba) to weight expert contributions optimally. Applied to interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification, REN achieves consistently superior performance: the radiomics-guided ensemble reached an average AUC of 0.8646 +/- 0.0467, a +12.5 percent improvement over the SwinUNETR baseline (AUC 0.7685, p = 0.031). Region-specific experts further revealed that lower-lobe models achieved AUCs of 0.88-0.90, surpassing DL counterparts (CNN: 0.76-0.79) and aligning with known disease progression patterns. Through rigorous patient-level cross-validation, REN demonstrates strong generalizability and clinical interpretability, presenting a scalable, anatomically-guided approach readily extensible to other structured medical imaging applications.

Abstract: The effectiveness of modern deep learning models is predicated on the availability of large-scale, human-annotated datasets, a process that is notoriously expensive and time-consuming. While Active Learning (AL) offers a strategic solution by labeling only the most informative and representative data, its iterative nature still necessitates significant human involvement. Unsupervised Active Learning (UAL) presents an alternative by shifting the annotation burden to a single, post-selection step. Unfortunately, prevailing UAL methods struggle to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These approaches typically rely on local, gradient-based scoring for sample importance estimation, which not only makes them vulnerable to ambiguous and noisy data but also hinders their capacity to select samples that adequately represent the full data distribution. Moreover, their use of shallow, one-shot linear selection falls short of a true UAL paradigm. In this paper, we propose the Natural Feature Progressive Framework (NFPF), a UAL method that revolutionizes how sample importance is measured. At its core, NFPF employs a Specific Feature Learning Machine (SFLM) to effectively quantify each sample's contribution to model performance. We further utilize the SFLM to define a powerful Reconstruction Difference metric for initial sample selection. Our comprehensive experiments show that NFPF significantly outperforms all established UAL methods and achieves performance on par with supervised AL methods on vision datasets. Detailed ablation studies and qualitative visualizations provide compelling evidence for NFPF's superior performance, enhanced robustness, and improved data distribution coverage.

Abstract: Dual-view mammography, including craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) projections, offers complementary anatomical views crucial for breast cancer diagnosis. However, in real-world clinical workflows, one view may be missing, corrupted, or degraded due to acquisition errors or compression artifacts, limiting the effectiveness of downstream analysis. View-to-view translation can help recover missing views and improve lesion alignment. Unlike natural images, this task in mammography is highly challenging due to large non-rigid deformations and severe tissue overlap in X-ray projections, which obscure pixel-level correspondences. In this paper, we propose Column-Aware and Implicit 3D Diffusion (CA3D-Diff), a novel bidirectional mammogram view translation framework based on conditional diffusion model. To address cross-view structural misalignment, we first design a column-aware cross-attention mechanism that leverages the geometric property that anatomically corresponding regions tend to lie in similar column positions across views. A Gaussian-decayed bias is applied to emphasize local column-wise correlations while suppressing distant mismatches. Furthermore, we introduce an implicit 3D structure reconstruction module that back-projects noisy 2D latents into a coarse 3D feature volume based on breast-view projection geometry. The reconstructed 3D structure is refined and injected into the denoising UNet to guide cross-view generation with enhanced anatomical awareness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CA3D-Diff achieves superior performance in bidirectional tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity and structural consistency. Furthermore, the synthesized views effectively improve single-view malignancy classification in screening settings, demonstrating the practical value of our method in real-world diagnostics.

Abstract: Tokenizers are a key component of state-of-the-art generative image models, extracting the most important features from the signal while reducing data dimension and redundancy. Most current tokenizers are based on KL-regularized variational autoencoders (KL-VAE), trained with reconstruction, perceptual and adversarial losses. Diffusion decoders have been proposed as a more principled alternative to model the distribution over images conditioned on the latent. However, matching the performance of KL-VAE still requires adversarial losses, as well as a higher decoding time due to iterative sampling. To address these limitations, we introduce a new pixel diffusion decoder architecture for improved scaling and training stability, benefiting from transformer components and GAN-free training. We use distillation to replicate the performance of the diffusion decoder in an efficient single-step decoder. This makes SSDD the first diffusion decoder optimized for single-step reconstruction trained without adversarial losses, reaching higher reconstruction quality and faster sampling than KL-VAE. In particular, SSDD improves reconstruction FID from $0.87$ to $0.50$ with $1.4\times$ higher throughput and preserve generation quality of DiTs with $3.8\times$ faster sampling. As such, SSDD can be used as a drop-in replacement for KL-VAE, and for building higher-quality and faster generative models.

Abstract: Being trained on large and vast datasets, visual foundation models (VFMs) can be fine-tuned for diverse downstream tasks, achieving remarkable performance and efficiency in various computer vision applications. The high computation cost of data collection and training motivates the owners of some VFMs to distribute them alongside the license to protect their intellectual property rights. However, a dishonest user of the protected model's copy may illegally redistribute it, for example, to make a profit. As a consequence, the development of reliable ownership verification tools is of great importance today, since such methods can be used to differentiate between a redistributed copy of the protected model and an independent model. In this paper, we propose an approach to ownership verification of visual foundation models by fine-tuning a small set of expressive layers of a VFM along with a small encoder-decoder network to embed digital watermarks into an internal representation of a hold-out set of input images. Importantly, the watermarks embedded remain detectable in the functional copies of the protected model, obtained, for example, by fine-tuning the VFM for a particular downstream task. Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed method yields a low probability of false detection of a non-watermarked model and a low probability of false misdetection of a watermarked model.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly applied to safety-critical tasks in resource-constrained environments, such as video-based driver action and intention recognition. While last layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL) methods can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, their performance varies. As an alternative to last layer approaches, we propose extending pre-trained DNNs with transformation layers to produce multiple latent representations to estimate the uncertainty. We evaluate our latent uncertainty representation (LUR) and repulsively trained LUR (RLUR) approaches against eight PDL methods across four video-based driver action and intention recognition datasets, comparing classification performance, calibration, and uncertainty-based OOD detection. We also contribute 28,000 frame-level action labels and 1,194 video-level intention labels for the NuScenes dataset. Our results show that LUR and RLUR achieve comparable in-distribution classification performance to other LL-PDL approaches. For uncertainty-based OOD detection, LUR matches top-performing PDL methods while being more efficient to train and easier to tune than approaches that require Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampling or repulsive training procedures.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons, leading to various movement disorder symptoms. Early diagnosis of PD is crucial to prevent adverse effects, yet traditional diagnostic methods are often cumbersome and costly. In this study, a machine learning-based approach is proposed using hand-drawn spiral and wave images as potential biomarkers for PD detection. Our methodology leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transfer learning, and attention mechanisms to improve model performance and resilience against overfitting. To enhance the diversity and richness of both spiral and wave categories, the training dataset undergoes augmentation to increase the number of images. The proposed architecture comprises three phases: utilizing pre-trained CNNs, incorporating custom convolutional layers, and ensemble voting. Employing hard voting further enhances performance by aggregating predictions from multiple models. Experimental results show promising accuracy rates. For spiral images, weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score are 90%, and for wave images, they are 96.67%. After combining the predictions through ensemble hard voting, the overall accuracy is 93.3%. These findings underscore the potential of machine learning in early PD diagnosis, offering a non-invasive and cost-effective solution to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer vision, requiring models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships, long-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence. The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

Abstract: Segment matching is an important intermediate task in computer vision that establishes correspondences between semantically or geometrically coherent regions across images. Unlike keypoint matching, which focuses on localized features, segment matching captures structured regions, offering greater robustness to occlusions, lighting variations, and viewpoint changes. In this paper, we leverage the spatial understanding of 3D foundation models to tackle wide-baseline segment matching, a challenging setting involving extreme viewpoint shifts. We propose an architecture that uses the inductive bias of these 3D foundation models to match segments across image pairs with up to 180 degree view-point change. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the SAM2 video propagator and local feature matching methods, by upto 30% on the AUPRC metric, on ScanNet++ and Replica datasets. We further demonstrate benefits of the proposed model on relevant downstream tasks, including 3D instance segmentation and image-goal navigation. Project Page: https://segmast3r.github.io/

<title>No-reference Quality Assessment of Contrast-distorted Images using Contrast-enhanced Pseudo Reference</title>

Abstract: Contrast change is an important factor that affects the quality of images. During image capturing, unfavorable lighting conditions can cause contrast change and visual quality loss. While various methods have been proposed to assess the quality of images under different distortions such as blur and noise, contrast distortion has been largely overlooked as its visual impact and properties are different from other conventional types of distortions. In this paper, we propose a no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metric for contrast-distorted images. Using a set of contrast enhancement algorithms, we aim to generate pseudo-reference images that are visually close to the actual reference image, such that the NR problem is transformed to a Full-reference (FR) assessment with higher accuracy. To this end, a large dataset of contrast-enhanced images is produced to train a classification network that can select the most suitable contrast enhancement algorithm based on image content and distortion for pseudo-reference image generation. Finally, the evaluation is performed in the FR manner to assess the quality difference between the contrast-enhanced (pseudoreference) and degraded images. Performance evaluation of the proposed method on three databases containing contrast distortions (CCID2014, TID2013, and CSIQ), indicates the promising performance of the proposed method.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate classification of waste and industrial surface defects is essential for ensuring sustainable waste management and maintaining high standards in quality control. This paper introduces the Neuroplastic Modular Classifier, a novel hybrid architecture designed for robust and adaptive image classification in dynamic environments. The model combines a ResNet-50 backbone for localized feature extraction with a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global semantic context. Additionally, FAISS-based similarity retrieval is incorporated to provide a memory-like reference to previously encountered data, enriching the model's feature space. A key innovation of our architecture is the neuroplastic modular design composed of expandable, learnable blocks that dynamically grow during training when performance plateaus. Inspired by biological learning systems, this mechanism allows the model to adapt to data complexity over time, improving generalization. Beyond garbage classification, we validate the model on the Kolektor Surface Defect Dataset 2 (KolektorSDD2), which involves industrial defect detection on metal surfaces. Experimental results across domains show that the proposed architecture outperforms traditional static models in both accuracy and adaptability. The Neuroplastic Modular Classifier offers a scalable, high-performance solution for real-world image classification, with strong applicability in both environmental and industrial domains.

Abstract: While modern visual generation models excel at creating aesthetically pleasing natural images, they struggle with producing or editing structured visuals like charts, diagrams, and mathematical figures, which demand composition planning, text rendering, and multimodal reasoning for factual fidelity. To address this, we present the first comprehensive, systematic investigation of this domain, encompassing data construction, model training, and an evaluation benchmark. First, we construct a large-scale dataset of 1.3 million high-quality structured image pairs derived from executable drawing programs and augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning annotations. Building on it, we train a unified model that integrates a VLM with FLUX.1 Kontext via a lightweight connector for enhanced multimodal understanding. A three-stage training curriculum enables progressive feature alignment, knowledge infusion, and reasoning-augmented generation, further boosted by an external reasoner at inference time. Finally, we introduce StructBench, a novel benchmark for generation and editing with over 1,700 challenging instances, and an accompanying evaluation metric, StructScore, which employs a multi-round Q\&amp;A protocol to assess fine-grained factual accuracy. Evaluations of 15 models reveal that even leading closed-source systems remain far from satisfactory. Our model attains strong editing performance, and inference-time reasoning yields consistent gains across diverse architectures. By releasing the dataset, model, and benchmark, we aim to advance unified multimodal foundations for structured visuals.

Abstract: Imagine Mr. Bean stepping into Tom and Jerry--can we generate videos where characters interact naturally across different worlds? We study inter-character interaction in text-to-video generation, where the key challenge is to preserve each character's identity and behaviors while enabling coherent cross-context interaction. This is difficult because characters may never have coexisted and because mixing styles often causes style delusion, where realistic characters appear cartoonish or vice versa. We introduce a framework that tackles these issues with Cross-Character Embedding (CCE), which learns identity and behavioral logic across multimodal sources, and Cross-Character Augmentation (CCA), which enriches training with synthetic co-existence and mixed-style data. Together, these techniques allow natural interactions between previously uncoexistent characters without losing stylistic fidelity. Experiments on a curated benchmark of cartoons and live-action series with 10 characters show clear improvements in identity preservation, interaction quality, and robustness to style delusion, enabling new forms of generative storytelling.Additional results and videos are available on our project page: https://tingtingliao.github.io/mimix/.

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce smooth and visually appealing clips, but they often struggle to synthesize complex dynamics with a coherent chain of consequences. Accurately modeling visual outcomes and state transitions over time remains a core challenge. In contrast, large language and multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) exhibit strong visual state reasoning and future prediction capabilities. To bridge these strengths, we introduce VChain, a novel inference-time chain-of-visual-thought framework that injects visual reasoning signals from multimodal models into video generation. Specifically, VChain contains a dedicated pipeline that leverages large multimodal models to generate a sparse set of critical keyframes as snapshots, which are then used to guide the sparse inference-time tuning of a pre-trained video generator only at these key moments. Our approach is tuning-efficient, introduces minimal overhead and avoids dense supervision. Extensive experiments on complex, multi-step scenarios show that VChain significantly enhances the quality of generated videos.

Abstract: Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research communication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often requiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10 minutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves distinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal information (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple aligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To address these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101 research papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and speaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos convey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation video generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout refinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding, subtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing slide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate that the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and informative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward automated and ready-to-use academic video generation. Our dataset, agent, and code are available at https://github.com/showlab/Paper2Video.

Abstract: Large time series foundation models often adopt channel-independent architectures to handle varying data dimensions, but this design ignores crucial cross-channel dependencies. Concurrently, existing multimodal approaches have not fully exploited the power of large vision models (LVMs) to interpret spatiotemporal data. Additionally, there remains significant unexplored potential in leveraging the advantages of information extraction from different modalities to enhance time series forecasting performance. To address these gaps, we propose the VIFO, a cross-modal forecasting model. VIFO uniquely renders multivariate time series into image, enabling pre-trained LVM to extract complex cross-channel patterns that are invisible to channel-independent models. These visual features are then aligned and fused with representations from the time series modality. By freezing the LVM and training only 7.45% of its parameters, VIFO achieves competitive performance on multiple benchmarks, offering an efficient and effective solution for capturing cross-variable relationships in

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the presence of real world noise and intentional perturbations remains a significant challenge. To address this, attribution methods have been proposed, though their efficacy remains suboptimal and necessitates further refinement. In this paper, we propose a novel category of transferable adversarial attacks, called transferable frequency-aware attacks, enabling frequency-aware exploration via both high-and low-frequency components. Based on this type of attacks, we also propose a novel attribution method, named Frequency-Aware Model Parameter Explorer (FAMPE), which improves the explainability for DNNs. Relative to the current state-of-the-art method AttEXplore, our FAMPE attains an average gain of 13.02% in Insertion Score, thereby outperforming existing approaches. Through detailed ablation studies, we also investigate the role of both high- and low-frequency components in explainability.

Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major public health concern, with over 69 million cases annually worldwide. Finite element (FE) models offer high-fidelity predictions of brain deformation but are computationally expensive, requiring hours per simulation and limiting their clinical utility for rapid decision-making. This study benchmarks state-of-the-art neural operator (NO) architectures for rapid, patient-specific prediction of brain displacement fields, aiming to enable real-time TBI modeling in clinical and translational settings. We formulated TBI modeling as an operator learning problem, mapping subject-specific anatomical MRI, magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) stiffness maps, and demographic features to full-field 3D brain displacement predictions. Four architectures - Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), Factorized FNO (F-FNO), Multi-Grid FNO (MG-FNO), and Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) were trained and evaluated on 249 MRE datasets across physiologically relevant frequencies (20 - 90 Hz). MG-FNO achieved the highest accuracy (MSE = 0.0023, 94.3\% spatial fidelity) and preserved fine-scale features, while F-FNO converged 2$\times$ faster than standard FNO. DeepONet offered the fastest inference (14.5 iterations/s) with a 7$\times$ computational speed-up over MG-FNO, suggesting utility for embedded or edge computing applications. All NOs reduced computation time from hours to milliseconds without sacrificing anatomical realism. NOs provide an efficient, resolution-invariant approach for predicting brain deformation, opening the door to real-time, patient-specific TBI risk assessment, clinical triage support, and optimization of protective equipment. These results highlight the potential for NO-based digital twins of the human brain, enabling scalable, on-demand biomechanical modeling in both clinical and population health contexts.

Abstract: Multi-domain translation (MDT) aims to learn translations between multiple domains, yet existing approaches either require fully aligned tuples or can only handle domain pairs seen in training, limiting their practicality and excluding many cross-domain mappings. We introduce universal MDT (UMDT), a generalization of MDT that seeks to translate between any pair of $K$ domains using only $K-1$ paired datasets with a central domain. To tackle this problem, we propose Diffusion Router (DR), a unified diffusion-based framework that models all central$\leftrightarrow$non-central translations with a single noise predictor conditioned on the source and target domain labels. DR enables indirect non-central translations by routing through the central domain. We further introduce a novel scalable learning strategy with a variational-bound objective and an efficient Tweedie refinement procedure to support direct non-central mappings. Through evaluation on three large-scale UMDT benchmarks, DR achieves state-of-the-art results for both indirect and direct translations, while lowering sampling cost and unlocking novel tasks such as sketch$\leftrightarrow$segmentation. These results establish DR as a scalable and versatile framework for universal translation across multiple domains.

<title>Rethinking Inter-LoRA Orthogonality in Adapter Merging: Insights from Orthogonal Monte Carlo Dropout</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Orthogonal Monte Carlo Dropout, a mechanism that enforces strict orthogonality when combining sparse semantic vectors without extra time complexity. LoRA, a popular fine-tuning method for large models, typically trains a module to represent a specific concept such as an object or a style. When multiple LoRAs are merged, for example to generate an object in a particular style, their semantic vectors may interfere with each other. Our method guarantees, at the theoretical and runtime levels, that merged LoRAs remain orthogonal and thus free from direct interference. However, empirical analysis reveals that such orthogonality does not lead to the semantic disentanglement or compositionality highlighted in prior work on compositional adaptation. This finding suggests that inter-LoRA orthogonality alone may be insufficient for achieving true semantic compositionality, prompting a re-examination of its role in adapter merging.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant computational and memory challenges, making extremely low-bit quantization crucial for their efficient deployment. In this work, we introduce SDQ-LLM: Sigma-Delta Quantization for 1-bit LLMs of any size, a novel framework that enables extremely low-bit quantization of LLMs while preserving their linguistic reasoning capabilities. A distinctive feature of SDQ-LLM is the continuous adjustability of the Over-Sampling Ratio (OSR), enabling dynamic adaptation to memory or VRAM constraints by selecting fractional OSR (e.g. 2.5 times) for an optimal trade-off between model size and accuracy. SDQ-LLM uses upsampling combined with Sigma-Delta Quantizer to binarize or ternarize LLMs weights, encoding high-precision parameters into 1-bit or 1.58-bit representations, replacing the multiplication operations within linear layers with addition. This approach significantly enhances inference efficiency under extremely low-bit quantization. To further reduce the loss of quantization precision, we incorporate Hadamard-based weight smoothing prior to quantization, improving the stability and robustness of the weight representations. Furthermore, to fully leverage the continuity of the OSR and reduce precision loss, recognizing the correlation between quantization sensitivity and weight variance, we propose a fine-grained, layer- and linear-wise OSR allocation strategy, MultiOSR. This strategy distributes OSR both across layers and within each layer, based on weight variance and parameter scale. Finally, extensive experiments on OPT and LLaMA model families demonstrate that SDQ-LLM achieves a more efficient and high-precision performance even under highly aggressive low-OSR settings.

Abstract: Concept erasure techniques have been widely deployed in T2I diffusion models to prevent inappropriate content generation for safety and copyright considerations. However, as models evolve to next-generation architectures like Flux, established erasure methods (\textit{e.g.}, ESD, UCE, AC) exhibit degraded effectiveness, raising questions about their true mechanisms. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that concept erasure creates only an illusion of ``amnesia": rather than genuine forgetting, these methods bias sampling trajectories away from target concepts, making the erasure fundamentally reversible. This insight motivates the need to distinguish superficial safety from genuine concept removal. In this work, we propose \textbf{RevAm} (\underline{Rev}oking \underline{Am}nesia), an RL-based trajectory optimization framework that resurrects erased concepts by dynamically steering the denoising process without modifying model weights. By adapting Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to diffusion models, RevAm explores diverse recovery trajectories through trajectory-level rewards, overcoming local optima that limit existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevAm achieves superior concept resurrection fidelity while reducing computational time by 10$\times$, exposing critical vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms and underscoring the need for more robust erasure techniques beyond trajectory manipulation.

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the problem of kinematic synthesis for planar linkages as a cross-domain image generation task. We develop a planar linkages dataset using RGB image representations, covering a range of mechanisms: from simple types such as crank-rocker and crank-slider to more complex eight-bar linkages like Jansen's mechanism. A shared-latent variational autoencoder (VAE) is employed to explore the potential of image generative models for synthesizing unseen motion curves and simulating novel kinematics. By encoding the drawing speed of trajectory points as color gradients, the same architecture also supports kinematic synthesis conditioned on both trajectory shape and velocity profiles. We validate our method on three datasets of increasing complexity: a standard four-bar linkage set, a mixed set of four-bar and crank-slider mechanisms, and a complex set including multi-loop mechanisms. Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of image-based representations for generative mechanical design, showing that mechanisms with revolute and prismatic joints, and potentially cams and gears, can be represented and synthesized within a unified image generation framework.

Abstract: We introduce Universal Beta Splatting (UBS), a unified framework that generalizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to N-dimensional anisotropic Beta kernels for explicit radiance field rendering. Unlike fixed Gaussian primitives, Beta kernels enable controllable dependency modeling across spatial, angular, and temporal dimensions within a single representation. Our unified approach captures complex light transport effects, handles anisotropic view-dependent appearance, and models scene dynamics without requiring auxiliary networks or specific color encodings. UBS maintains backward compatibility by approximating to Gaussian Splatting as a special case, guaranteeing plug-in usability and lower performance bounds. The learned Beta parameters naturally decompose scene properties into interpretable without explicit supervision: spatial (surface vs. texture), angular (diffuse vs. specular), and temporal (static vs. dynamic). Our CUDA-accelerated implementation achieves real-time rendering while consistently outperforming existing methods across static, view-dependent, and dynamic benchmarks, establishing Beta kernels as a scalable universal primitive for radiance field rendering.

Abstract: $\textbf{Purpose:}$ To develop and evaluate an operator learning framework for nonlinear inversion (NLI) of brain magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) data, which enables real-time inversion of elastograms with comparable spatial accuracy to NLI.
  $\textbf{Materials and Methods:}$ In this retrospective study, 3D MRE data from 61 individuals (mean age, 37.4 years; 34 female) were used for development of the framework. A predictive deep operator learning framework (oNLI) was trained using 10-fold cross-validation, with the complex curl of the measured displacement field as inputs and NLI-derived reference elastograms as outputs. A structural prior mechanism, analogous to Soft Prior Regularization in the MRE literature, was incorporated to improve spatial accuracy. Subject-level evaluation metrics included Pearson's correlation coefficient, absolute relative error, and structural similarity index measure between predicted and reference elastograms across brain regions of different sizes to understand accuracy. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests comparing the proposed oNLI variants to the convolutional neural network baselines.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ Whole brain absolute percent error was 8.4 $\pm$ 0.5 ($\mu'$) and 10.0 $\pm$ 0.7 ($\mu''$) for oNLI and 15.8 $\pm$ 0.8 ($\mu'$) and 26.1 $\pm$ 1.1 ($\mu''$) for CNNs. Additionally, oNLI outperformed convolutional architectures as per Pearson's correlation coefficient, $r$, in the whole brain and across all subregions for both the storage modulus and loss modulus (p < 0.05).
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ The oNLI framework enables real-time MRE inversion (30,000x speedup), outperforming CNN-based approaches and maintaining the fine-grained spatial accuracy achievable with NLI in the brain.

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation~(DFKD) is an effective manner to solve model compression and transmission restrictions while retaining privacy protection, which has attracted extensive attention in recent years. Currently, the majority of existing methods utilize a generator to synthesize images to support the distillation. Although the current methods have achieved great success, there are still many issues to be explored. Firstly, the outstanding performance of supervised learning in deep learning drives us to explore a pseudo-supervised paradigm on DFKD. Secondly, current synthesized methods cannot distinguish the distributions of different categories of samples, thus producing ambiguous samples that may lead to an incorrect evaluation by the teacher. Besides, current methods cannot optimize the category-wise diversity samples, which will hinder the student model learning from diverse samples and further achieving better performance. In this paper, to address the above limitations, we propose a novel learning paradigm, i.e., conditional pseudo-supervised contrast for data-free knowledge distillation~(CPSC-DFKD). The primary innovations of CPSC-DFKD are: (1) introducing a conditional generative adversarial network to synthesize category-specific diverse images for pseudo-supervised learning, (2) improving the modules of the generator to distinguish the distributions of different categories, and (3) proposing pseudo-supervised contrastive learning based on teacher and student views to enhance diversity. Comprehensive experiments on three commonly-used datasets validate the performance lift of both the student and generator brought by CPSC-DFKD.

Abstract: Accurate camera-to-robot calibration is essential for any vision-based robotic control system and especially critical in minimally invasive surgical robots, where instruments conduct precise micro-manipulations. However, MIS robots have long kinematic chains and partial visibility of their degrees of freedom in the camera, which introduces challenges for conventional camera-to-robot calibration methods that assume stiff robots with good visibility. Previous works have investigated both keypoint-based and rendering-based approaches to address this challenge in real-world conditions; however, they often struggle with consistent feature detection or have long inference times, neither of which are ideal for online robot control. In this work, we propose a novel framework that unifies the detection of geometric primitives (keypoints and shaft edges) through a shared encoding, enabling efficient pose estimation via projection geometry. This architecture detects both keypoints and edges in a single inference and is trained on large-scale synthetic data with projective labeling. This method is evaluated across both feature detection and pose estimation, with qualitative and quantitative results demonstrating fast performance and state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging surgical environments.

Abstract: Brain tumors, particularly gliomas, pose significant chall-enges due to their complex growth patterns, infiltrative nature, and the variability in brain structure across individuals, which makes accurate diagnosis and monitoring difficult. Deep learning models have been developed to accurately delineate these tumors. However, most of these models were trained on relatively homogenous high-resource datasets, limiting their robustness when deployed in underserved regions. In this study, we performed segmentation-aware offline data augmentation on the BraTS-Africa dataset to increase the data sample size and diversity to enhance generalization. We further constructed an ensemble of three distinct architectures, MedNeXt, SegMamba, and Residual-Encoder U-Net, to leverage their complementary strengths. Our best-performing model, MedNeXt, was trained on 1000 epochs and achieved the highest average lesion-wise dice and normalized surface distance scores of 0.86 and 0.81 respectively. However, the ensemble model trained for 500 epochs produced the most balanced segmentation performance across the tumour subregions. This work demonstrates that a combination of advanced augmentation and model ensembling can improve segmentation accuracy and robustness on diverse and underrepresented datasets.

Abstract: Generative models for sequential data often struggle with sparsely sampled and high-dimensional trajectories, typically reducing the learning of dynamics to pairwise transitions. We propose \textit{Interpolative Multi-Marginal Flow Matching} (IMMFM), a framework that learns continuous stochastic dynamics jointly consistent with multiple observed time points. IMMFM employs a piecewise-quadratic interpolation path as a smooth target for flow matching and jointly optimizes drift and a data-driven diffusion coefficient, supported by a theoretical condition for stable learning. This design captures intrinsic stochasticity, handles irregular sparse sampling, and yields subject-specific trajectories. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world longitudinal neuroimaging datasets show that IMMFM outperforms existing methods in both forecasting accuracy and further downstream tasks.

Abstract: Small Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to larger models, at the cost of weaker generalization abilities and downstream task performance. These shortcomings could be addressed by test-time scaling techniques, but existing methods are typically computationally demanding, contradicting the resource-efficient design goals of small models. To address these limitations, we propose two novel and efficient test-time scaling strategies that leverage the model-internal features rather than external supervision: (i) Test-Time Augmentation (TTAug), which generates multiple augmented inputs and aggregates outputs at the token level without parameter updates, and (ii) Test-Time Adaptation (TTAdapt), which adapts model parameters during inference using consensus-based pseudolabels from TTAug. Through extensive experiments across nine benchmarks, we demonstrate consistent performance improvements while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained environments. The generality of our approach is demonstrated both within models at different scales and across different VLMs without additional tuning.

<title>Model-Guided Microstimulation Steers Primate Visual Behavior</title>

Abstract: Brain stimulation is a powerful tool for understanding cortical function and holds promise for therapeutic interventions in neuropsychiatric disorders. Initial visual prosthetics apply electric microstimulation to early visual cortex which can evoke percepts of simple symbols such as letters. However, these approaches are fundamentally limited by hardware constraints and the low-level representational properties of this cortical region. In contrast, higher-level visual areas encode more complex object representations and therefore constitute a promising target for stimulation - but determining representational targets that reliably evoke object-level percepts constitutes a major challenge. We here introduce a computational framework to causally model and guide stimulation of high-level cortex, comprising three key components: (1) a perturbation module that translates microstimulation parameters into spatial changes to neural activity, (2) topographic models that capture the spatial organization of cortical neurons and thus enable prototyping of stimulation experiments, and (3) a mapping procedure that links model-optimized stimulation sites back to primate cortex. Applying this framework in two macaque monkeys performing a visual recognition task, model-predicted stimulation experiments produced significant in-vivo changes in perceptual choices. Per-site model predictions and monkey behavior were strongly correlated, underscoring the promise of model-guided stimulation. Image generation further revealed a qualitative similarity between in-silico stimulation of face-selective sites and a patient's report of facephenes. This proof-of-principle establishes a foundation for model-guided microstimulation and points toward next-generation visual prosthetics capable of inducing more complex visual experiences.

Abstract: We introduce EmbodiSwap - a method for producing photorealistic synthetic robot overlays over human video. We employ EmbodiSwap for zero-shot imitation learning, bridging the embodiment gap between in-the-wild ego-centric human video and a target robot embodiment. We train a closed-loop robot manipulation policy over the data produced by EmbodiSwap. We make novel use of V-JEPA as a visual backbone, repurposing V-JEPA from the domain of video understanding to imitation learning over synthetic robot videos. Adoption of V-JEPA outperforms alternative vision backbones more conventionally used within robotics. In real-world tests, our zero-shot trained V-JEPA model achieves an $82\%$ success rate, outperforming a few-shot trained $\pi_0$ network as well as $\pi_0$ trained over data produced by EmbodiSwap. We release (i) code for generating the synthetic robot overlays which takes as input human videos and an arbitrary robot URDF and generates a robot dataset, (ii) the robot dataset we synthesize over EPIC-Kitchens, HOI4D and Ego4D, and (iii) model checkpoints and inference code, to facilitate reproducible research and broader adoption.

Abstract: Humans understand the world through the integration of multiple sensory modalities, enabling them to perceive, reason about, and imagine dynamic physical processes. Inspired by this capability, multimodal foundation models (MFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for multimodal understanding and generation. However, today's MFMs fall short of serving as effective world models. They lack the essential ability such as perform counterfactual reasoning, simulate dynamics, understand the spatiotemporal information, control generated visual outcomes, and perform multifaceted reasoning. We investigates what it takes to bridge the gap between multimodal foundation models and world models. We begin by improving the reasoning capabilities of MFMs through discriminative tasks and equipping MFMs with structured reasoning skills, such as causal inference, counterfactual thinking, and spatiotemporal reasoning, enabling them to go beyond surface correlations and understand deeper relationships within visual and textual data. Next, we explore generative capabilities of multimodal foundation models across both image and video modalities, introducing new frameworks for structured and controllable generation. Our approaches incorporate scene graphs, multimodal conditioning, and multimodal alignment strategies to guide the generation process, ensuring consistency with high-level semantics and fine-grained user intent. We further extend these techniques to controllable 4D generation, enabling interactive, editable, and morphable object synthesis over time and space.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance in generating high-fidelity images, largely enabled by text-guided inference. However, this advantage often comes with a critical drawback: limited diversity, as outputs tend to collapse into similar modes under strong text guidance. Existing approaches typically optimize intermediate latents or text conditions during inference, but these methods deliver only modest gains or remain sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Noise Optimization, a simple yet effective method that addresses the diversity issue from a distinct perspective. Unlike prior techniques that adapt intermediate latents, our approach shapes the initial noise to promote diverse outputs. Specifically, we develop a contrastive loss defined in the Tweedie data space and optimize a batch of noise latents. Our contrastive optimization repels instances within the batch to maximize diversity while keeping them anchored to a reference sample to preserve fidelity. We further provide theoretical insights into the mechanism of this preprocessing to substantiate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior quality-diversity Pareto frontier while remaining robust to hyperparameter choices.

<title>Towards Robust and Generalizable Continuous Space-Time Video Super-Resolution with Events</title>

Abstract: Continuous space-time video super-resolution (C-STVSR) has garnered increasing interest for its capability to reconstruct high-resolution and high-frame-rate videos at arbitrary spatial and temporal scales. However, prevailing methods often generalize poorly, producing unsatisfactory results when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) scales. To overcome this limitation, we present EvEnhancer, a novel approach that marries the unique properties of high temporal resolution and high dynamic range encapsulated in event streams to achieve robust and generalizable C-STVSR. Our approach incorporates event-adapted synthesis that capitalizes on the spatiotemporal correlations between frames and events to capture long-term motion trajectories, enabling adaptive interpolation and fusion across space and time. This is then coupled with a local implicit video transformer that integrates local implicit video neural function with cross-scale spatiotemporal attention to learn continuous video representations and generate plausible videos at arbitrary resolutions and frame rates. We further develop EvEnhancerPlus, which builds a controllable switching mechanism that dynamically determines the reconstruction difficulty for each spatiotemporal pixel based on local event statistics. This allows the model to adaptively route reconstruction along the most suitable pathways at a fine-grained pixel level, substantially reducing computational overhead while maintaining excellent performance. Furthermore, we devise a cross-derivative training strategy that stabilizes the convergence of such a multi-pathway framework through staged cross-optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, while maintaining superior generalizability at OOD scales. The code is available at https://github.com/W-Shuoyan/EvEnhancerPlus.

Abstract: We propose a simple, data-efficient pipeline that augments an implicit reconstruction network based on neural SDF-based CAD parts with a part-segmentation head trained under PartField-generated supervision. Unlike methods tied to fixed taxonomies, our model accepts meshes with any number of parts and produces coherent, geometry-aligned labels in a single pass. We evaluate on randomly sampled CAD meshes from the ABC dataset with intentionally varied part cardinalities, including over-segmented shapes, and report strong performance across reconstruction (CDL1/CDL2, F1-micro, NC) and segmentation (mIoU, Accuracy), together with a new Segmentation Consistency metric that captures local label smoothness. We attach a lightweight segmentation head to the Flat-CAD SDF trunk; on a paired evaluation it does not alter reconstruction while providing accurate part labels for meshes with any number of parts. Even under degraded reconstructions on thin or intricate geometries, segmentation remains accurate and label-coherent, often preserving the correct part count. Our approach therefore offers a practical route to semantically structured CAD meshes without requiring curated taxonomies or exact palette matches. We discuss limitations in boundary precision, partly due to per-face supervision, and outline paths toward boundary-aware training and higher resolution labels.

Abstract: Background: Pleural Effusions (PE) is a common finding in many different clinical conditions, but accurately measuring their volume from CT scans is challenging. Purpose: To improve PE segmentation and quantification for enhanced clinical management, we have developed and trained a semi-supervised deep learning framework on contrast-enhanced CT volumes. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study collected CT Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) data from internal and external datasets. A subset of 100 cases was manually annotated for model training, while the remaining cases were used for testing and validation. A novel semi-supervised deep learning framework, Teacher-Teaching Assistant-Student (TTAS), was developed and used to enable efficient training in non-segmented examinations. Segmentation performance was compared to that of state-of-the-art models. Results: 100 patients (mean age, 72 years, 28 [standard deviation]; 55 men) were included in the study. The TTAS model demonstrated superior segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art models, achieving a mean Dice score of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79 - 0.84) versus 0.73 for nnU-Net (p < 0.0001, Student's T test). Additionally, TTAS exhibited a four-fold lower mean Absolute Volume Difference (AbVD) of 6.49 mL (95% CI, 4.80 - 8.20) compared to nnU-Net's AbVD of 23.16 mL (p < 0.0001). Conclusion: The developed TTAS framework offered superior PE segmentation, aiding accurate volume determination from CT scans.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a pivotal advance in embodied intelligence, yet they confront critical barriers to real-world deployment, most notably catastrophic forgetting. This issue stems from their overreliance on continuous action sequences or action chunks, which inadvertently create isolated data silos that disrupt knowledge retention across tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA) framework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories, thereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory fine-tuning. A key innovation of NoTVLA lies in its trajectory planning strategy: instead of centering on the target object's trajectory, it leverages temporal compression and spatial reasoning pruning specifically for the robot end effector's trajectory. Furthermore, training is conducted using these sparse trajectories rather than dense action trajectories, an optimization that delivers remarkable practical advantages with better performance in zero-shot. In multi-task evaluation scenarios, NoTVLA achieves superior performance and generalization compared to pi0 while operating under two critical constraints: it uses over an order of magnitude less computing power than pi0 and requires no wrist-mounted camera. This design ensures that NoTVLA's operational accuracy closely approximates that of single-task expert models. Crucially, it also preserves the model's inherent language capabilities, enabling zero-shot generalization in specific scenarios, supporting unified model deployment across multiple robot platforms, and fostering a degree of generalization even when perceiving tasks from novel perspectives.

Abstract: To manage the complexity of transformers in video compression, local attention mechanisms are a practical necessity. The common approach of partitioning frames into patches, however, creates architectural flaws like irregular receptive fields. When adapted for temporal autoregressive models, this paradigm, exemplified by the Video Compression Transformer (VCT), also necessitates computationally redundant overlapping windows. This work introduces 3D Sliding Window Attention (SWA), a patchless form of local attention. By enabling a decoder-only architecture that unifies spatial and temporal context processing, and by providing a uniform receptive field, our method significantly improves rate-distortion performance, achieving Bj{\o}rntegaard Delta-rate savings of up to 18.6 % against the VCT baseline. Simultaneously, by eliminating the need for overlapping windows, our method reduces overall decoder complexity by a factor of 2.8, while its entropy model is nearly 3.5 times more efficient. We further analyze our model's behavior and show that while it benefits from long-range temporal context, excessive context can degrade performance.

Abstract: Image projection systems must be efficient in data storage, computation and transmission while maintaining a large space-bandwidth-product (SBP) at their output. Here, we introduce a hybrid image projection system that achieves extended depth-of-field (DOF) with improved resolution, combining a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based digital encoder with an all-optical diffractive decoder. A CNN-based encoder compresses input images into compact phase representations, which are subsequently displayed by a low-resolution (LR) projector and processed by an analog diffractive decoder for all-optical image reconstruction. This optical decoder is completely passive, designed to synthesize pixel super-resolved image projections that feature an extended DOF while eliminating the need for additional power consumption for super-resolved image reconstruction. Our pixel super-resolution (PSR) image projection system demonstrates high-fidelity image synthesis over an extended DOF of ~267xW, where W is the illumination wavelength, concurrently offering up to ~16-fold SBP improvement at each lateral plane. The proof of concept of this approach is validated through an experiment conducted in the THz spectrum, and the system is scalable across different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This image projection architecture can reduce data storage and transmission requirements for display systems without imposing additional power constraints on the optical decoder. Beyond extended DOF PSR image projection, the underlying principles of this approach can be extended to various applications, including optical metrology and microscopy.

Abstract: Pollinators are critical to the world's ecosystems and food supply, yet recent studies have found pollination shortfalls in several crops, including strawberry. This is troubling because wild and managed pollinators are currently experiencing declines. One possibility is to try and provide supplemental pollination solutions. These solutions should be affordable and simple for farmers to implement if their use is to be widespread; quadcopters are a great example, already used for monitoring on many farms. This paper investigates a new method for artificial pollination based on wind pollination that bears further investigation. After determining the height where the lateral flow is maximized, we performed field experiments with a quadcopter assisting natural pollinators. Although our results in the field were inconclusive, lab studies show that the idea shows promise and could be adapted for better field results.

Abstract: People often struggle to remember specific details of past experiences, which can lead to the need to revisit these memories. Consequently, lifelog retrieval has emerged as a crucial application. Various studies have explored methods to facilitate rapid access to personal lifelogs for memory recall assistance. In this paper, we propose a Captioning-Integrated Visual Lifelog (CIVIL) Retrieval System for extracting specific images from a user's visual lifelog based on textual queries. Unlike traditional embedding-based methods, our system first generates captions for visual lifelogs and then utilizes a text embedding model to project both the captions and user queries into a shared vector space. Visual lifelogs, captured through wearable cameras, provide a first-person viewpoint, necessitating the interpretation of the activities of the individual behind the camera rather than merely describing the scene. To address this, we introduce three distinct approaches: the single caption method, the collective caption method, and the merged caption method, each designed to interpret the life experiences of lifeloggers. Experimental results show that our method effectively describes first-person visual images, enhancing the outcomes of lifelog retrieval. Furthermore, we construct a textual dataset that converts visual lifelogs into captions, thereby reconstructing personal life experiences.

Abstract: Supervised learning (SL) methods are indispensable for neural network (NN) training used to perform classification tasks. While resulting in very high accuracy, SL training often requires making NN parameter number dependent on the number of classes, limiting their applicability when the number of classes is extremely large or unknown in advance. In this paper we propose a methodology that allows one to train the same NN architecture regardless of the number of classes. This is achieved by using predefined vector systems as the target latent space configuration (LSC) during NN training. We discuss the desired properties of target configurations and choose randomly perturbed vectors of An root system for our experiments. These vectors are used to successfully train encoders and visual transformers (ViT) on Cinic-10 and ImageNet-1K in low- and high-dimensional cases by matching NN predictions with the predefined vectors. Finally, ViT is trained on a dataset with 1.28 million classes illustrating the applicability of the method to training on datasets with extremely large number of classes. In addition, potential applications of LSC in lifelong learning and NN distillation are discussed illustrating versatility of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search is a fundamental problem in information retrieval, underpinning large-scale applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and cross-modal search. Hashing-based methods provide an efficient solution by mapping high-dimensional data into compact binary codes that enable fast similarity computations in Hamming space. Over the past two decades, a substantial body of work has explored learning to hash, where projection and quantisation functions are optimised from data rather than chosen at random.
  This article offers a foundational survey of early learning-based hashing methods, with an emphasis on the core ideas that shaped the field. We review supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised approaches, highlighting how projection functions are designed to generate meaningful embeddings and how quantisation strategies convert these embeddings into binary codes. We also examine extensions to multi-bit and multi-threshold models, as well as early advances in cross-modal retrieval.
  Rather than providing an exhaustive account of the most recent methods, our goal is to introduce the conceptual foundations of learning-based hashing for ANN search. By situating these early models in their historical context, we aim to equip readers with a structured understanding of the principles, trade-offs, and open challenges that continue to inform current research in this area.

<title>MoME: Mixture of Matryoshka Experts for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential in audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR), but their high computational demands and sensitivity to token granularity limit their practicality in resource-constrained settings. Token compression methods can reduce inference cost, but they require fixing a compression rate in advance and produce a single fixed-length output, offering no flexibility to balance information density and efficiency at inference time. Matryoshka representation learning (MRL) addresses this by enabling a single model to operate across multiple token granularities, allowing compression rates to be adjusted dynamically. However, current MRL-based methods treat each scale independently during training, limiting cross-scale generalization, robustness at high compression, and interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoME (Mixture of Matryoshka Experts), a novel framework that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into MRL-based LLMs for AVSR. MoME augments a frozen LLM with top-k routed and shared experts, allowing dynamic capacity allocation across scales and modalities. A shared router promotes consistent expert activation across granularities, enabling compressed sequences to benefit from representations learned at lower compression. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 demonstrate that MoME achieves state-of-the-art performance across AVSR, ASR, and VSR tasks, while requiring significantly fewer parameters and maintaining robustness under noise. MoME unifies the adaptability of MRL with the efficiency of MoE, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for resource-aware speech recognition.

<title>DoRAN: Stabilizing Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation via Noise Injection and Auxiliary Networks</title>

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have become the standard paradigm for adapting large-scale models. Among these techniques, Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) has been shown to improve both the learning capacity and training stability of the vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method by explicitly decomposing pre-trained weights into magnitude and directional components. In this work, we propose DoRAN, a new variant of DoRA designed to further stabilize training and boost the sample efficiency of DoRA. Our approach includes two key stages: (i) injecting noise into the denominator of DoRA's weight decomposition, which serves as an adaptive regularizer to mitigate instabilities; and (ii) replacing static low-rank matrices with auxiliary networks that generate them dynamically, enabling parameter coupling across layers and yielding better sample efficiency in both theory and practice. Comprehensive experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that DoRAN consistently outperforms LoRA, DoRA, and other PEFT baselines. These results underscore the effectiveness of combining stabilization through noise-based regularization with network-based parameter generation, offering a promising direction for robust and efficient fine-tuning of foundation models.

<title>The method of the approximate inverse for limited-angle CT</title>

Abstract: Limited-angle computerized tomography stands for one of the most difficult challenges in imaging. Although it opens the way to faster data acquisition in industry and less dangerous scans in medicine, standard approaches, such as the filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm or the widely used total-variation functional, often produce various artefacts that hinder the diagnosis. With the rise of deep learning, many modern techniques have proven themselves successful in removing such artefacts but at the cost of large datasets. In this paper, we propose a new model-driven approach based on the method of the approximate inverse, which could serve as new starting point for learning strategies in the future. In contrast to FBP-type approaches, our reconstruction step consists in evaluating linear functionals on the measured data using reconstruction kernels that are precomputed as solution of an auxiliary problem. With this problem being uniquely solvable, the derived limited-angle reconstruction kernel (LARK) is able to fully reconstruct the object without the well-known streak artefacts, even for large limited angles. However, it inherits severe ill-conditioning which leads to a different kind of artefacts arising from the singular functions of the limited-angle Radon transform. The problem becomes particularly challenging when working on semi-discrete (real or analytical) measurements. We develop a general regularization strategy, named constrained limited-angle reconstruction kernel (CLARK), by combining spectral filter, the method of the approximate inverse and custom edge-preserving denoising in order to stabilize the whole process. We further derive and interpret error estimates for the application on real, i.e. semi-discrete, data and we validate our approach on synthetic and real data.

<title>Partial Information Decomposition via Normalizing Flows in Latent Gaussian Distributions</title>

Abstract: The study of multimodality has garnered significant interest in fields where the analysis of interactions among multiple information sources can enhance predictive modeling, data fusion, and interpretability. Partial information decomposition (PID) has emerged as a useful information-theoretic framework to quantify the degree to which individual modalities independently, redundantly, or synergistically convey information about a target variable. However, existing PID methods depend on optimizing over a joint distribution constrained by estimated pairwise probability distributions, which are costly and inaccurate for continuous and high-dimensional modalities. Our first key insight is that the problem can be solved efficiently when the pairwise distributions are multivariate Gaussians, and we refer to this problem as Gaussian PID (GPID). We propose a new gradient-based algorithm that substantially improves the computational efficiency of GPID based on an alternative formulation of the underlying optimization problem. To generalize the applicability to non-Gaussian data, we learn information-preserving encoders to transform random variables of arbitrary input distributions into pairwise Gaussian random variables. Along the way, we resolved an open problem regarding the optimality of joint Gaussian solutions for GPID. Empirical validation in diverse synthetic examples demonstrates that our proposed method provides more accurate and efficient PID estimates than existing baselines. We further evaluate a series of large-scale multimodal benchmarks to show its utility in real-world applications of quantifying PID in multimodal datasets and selecting high-performing models.

Abstract: Accurate and fast urban noise prediction is pivotal for public health and for regulatory workflows in cities, where the Environmental Noise Directive mandates regular strategic noise maps and action plans, often needed in permission workflows, right-of-way allocation, and construction scheduling. Physics-based solvers are too slow for such time-critical, iterative "what-if" studies. We evaluate conditional Normalizing Flows (Full-Glow) for generating for generating standards-compliant urban sound-pressure maps from 2D urban layouts in real time per 256x256 map on a single RTX 4090), enabling interactive exploration directly on commodity hardware. On datasets covering Baseline, Diffraction, and Reflection regimes, our model accelerates map generation by >2000 times over a reference solver while improving NLoS accuracy by up to 24% versus prior deep models; in Baseline NLoS we reach 0.65 dB MAE with high structural fidelity. The model reproduces diffraction and interference patterns and supports instant recomputation under source or geometry changes, making it a practical engine for urban planning, compliance mapping, and operations (e.g., temporary road closures, night-work variance assessments).

<title>ChartAgent: A Multimodal Agent for Visually Grounded Reasoning in Complex Chart Question Answering</title>

Abstract: Recent multimodal LLMs have shown promise in chart-based visual question answering, but their performance declines sharply on unannotated charts, those requiring precise visual interpretation rather than relying on textual shortcuts. To address this, we introduce ChartAgent, a novel agentic framework that explicitly performs visual reasoning directly within the chart's spatial domain. Unlike textual chain-of-thought reasoning, ChartAgent iteratively decomposes queries into visual subtasks and actively manipulates and interacts with chart images through specialized actions such as drawing annotations, cropping regions (e.g., segmenting pie slices, isolating bars), and localizing axes, using a library of chart-specific vision tools to fulfill each subtask. This iterative reasoning process closely mirrors human cognitive strategies for chart comprehension. ChartAgent achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the ChartBench and ChartX benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by up to 16.07% absolute gain overall and 17.31% on unannotated, numerically intensive queries. Furthermore, our analyses show that ChartAgent is (a) effective across diverse chart types, (b) achieve the highest scores across varying visual and reasoning complexity levels, and (c) serves as a plug-and-play framework that boosts performance across diverse underlying LLMs. Our work is among the first to demonstrate visually grounded reasoning for chart understanding using tool-augmented multimodal agents.

<title>3Dify: a Framework for Procedural 3D-CG Generation Assisted by LLMs Using MCP and RAG</title>

arXiv:2510.04536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes "3Dify," a procedural 3D computer graphics (3D-CG) generation framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework enables users to generate 3D-CG content solely through natural language instructions. 3Dify is built upon Dify, an open-source platform for AI application development, and incorporates several state-of-the-art LLM-related technologies such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). For 3D-CG generation support, 3Dify automates the operation of various Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools via MCP. When DCC tools do not support MCP-based interaction, the framework employs the Computer-Using Agent (CUA) method to automate Graphical User Interface (GUI) operations. Moreover, to enhance image generation quality, 3Dify allows users to provide feedback by selecting preferred images from multiple candidates. The LLM then learns variable patterns from these selections and applies them to subsequent generations. Furthermore, 3Dify supports the integration of locally deployed LLMs, enabling users to utilize custom-developed models and to reduce both time and monetary costs associated with external API calls by leveraging their own computational resources.

Abstract: Existing 2D-lifting-based 3D editing methods often encounter challenges related to inconsistency, stemming from the lack of view-consistent 2D editing models and the difficulty of ensuring consistent editing across multiple views. To address these issues, we propose C3Editor, a controllable and consistent 2D-lifting-based 3D editing framework. Given an original 3D representation and a text-based editing prompt, our method selectively establishes a view-consistent 2D editing model to achieve superior 3D editing results. The process begins with the controlled selection of a ground truth (GT) view and its corresponding edited image as the optimization target, allowing for user-defined manual edits. Next, we fine-tune the 2D editing model within the GT view and across multiple views to align with the GT-edited image while ensuring multi-view consistency. To meet the distinct requirements of GT view fitting and multi-view consistency, we introduce separate LoRA modules for targeted fine-tuning. Our approach delivers more consistent and controllable 2D and 3D editing results than existing 2D-lifting-based methods, outperforming them in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Transformer-based vision encoders -- such as CLIP -- are central to multimodal intelligence, powering applications from autonomous web agents to robotic control. Since these applications often demand real-time processing of massive visual data, reducing the inference cost of vision encoders is critical. Post-training quantization offers a practical path, but remains challenging even at 8-bit precision due to massive-scale activations (i.e., outliers). In this work, we propose $\textit{RegCache}$, a training-free algorithm to mitigate outliers in vision encoders, enabling quantization with significantly smaller accuracy drops. The proposed RegCache introduces outlier-prone yet semantically meaningless prefix tokens to the target vision encoder, which prevents other tokens from having outliers. Notably, we observe that outliers in vision encoders behave differently from those in language models, motivating two technical innovations: middle-layer prefixing and token deletion. Experiments show that our method consistently improves the accuracy of quantized models across both text-supervised and self-supervised vision encoders.

arXiv:2510.04553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a scalable witness-based persistent homology pipeline for full-brain MRI volumes that couples density-aware landmark selection with a GPU-ready witness filtration. Candidates are scored by a hybrid metric that balances geometric coverage against inverse kernel density, yielding landmark sets that shrink mean pairwise distances by 30-60% over random or density-only baselines while preserving topological features. Benchmarks on BrainWeb, IXI, and synthetic manifolds execute in under ten seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, avoiding the combinatorial blow-up of Cech, Vietoris-Rips, and alpha filtrations. The package is distributed on PyPI as whale-tda (installable via pip); source and issues are hosted at https://github.com/jorgeLRW/whale. The release also exposes a fast preset (mri_deep_dive_fast) for exploratory sweeps, and ships with reproducibility-focused scripts and artifacts for drop-in use in medical imaging workflows.

Abstract: Deep generative models have made significant advances in generating complex content, yet conditional generation remains a fundamental challenge. Existing conditional generative adversarial networks often struggle to balance the dual objectives of assessing authenticity and conditional alignment of input samples within their conditional discriminators. To address this, we propose a novel discriminator design that integrates three key capabilities: unconditional discrimination, matching-aware supervision to enhance alignment sensitivity, and adaptive weighting to dynamically balance all objectives. Specifically, we introduce Sum of Naturalness and Alignment (SONA), which employs separate projections for naturalness (authenticity) and alignment in the final layer with an inductive bias, supported by dedicated objective functions and an adaptive weighting mechanism. Extensive experiments on class-conditional generation tasks show that \ours achieves superior sample quality and conditional alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness in text-to-image generation, confirming the versatility and robustness of our approach.

Abstract: We present Social Agent, a novel framework for synthesizing realistic and contextually appropriate co-speech nonverbal behaviors in dyadic conversations. In this framework, we develop an agentic system driven by a Large Language Model (LLM) to direct the conversation flow and determine appropriate interactive behaviors for both participants. Additionally, we propose a novel dual-person gesture generation model based on an auto-regressive diffusion model, which synthesizes coordinated motions from speech signals. The output of the agentic system is translated into high-level guidance for the gesture generator, resulting in realistic movement at both the behavioral and motion levels. Furthermore, the agentic system periodically examines the movements of interlocutors and infers their intentions, forming a continuous feedback loop that enables dynamic and responsive interactions between the two participants. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that our model significantly improves the quality of dyadic interactions, producing natural, synchronized nonverbal behaviors.

Abstract: Computer use agents (CUAs) need to plan task workflows grounded in diverse, ever-changing applications and environments, but learning is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data in the target application. Existing datasets are domain-specific, static, and costly to annotate, while current synthetic data generation methods often yield simplistic or misaligned task demonstrations. To address these limitations, we introduce Watch & Learn (W&amp;L), a framework that converts human demonstration videos readily available on the Internet into executable UI trajectories at scale. Instead of directly generating trajectories or relying on ad hoc reasoning heuristics, we cast the problem as an inverse dynamics objective: predicting the user's action from consecutive screen states. This formulation reduces manual engineering, is easier to learn, and generalizes more robustly across applications. Concretely, we develop an inverse dynamics labeling pipeline with task-aware video retrieval, generate over 53k high-quality trajectories from raw web videos, and demonstrate that these trajectories improve CUAs both as in-context demonstrations and as supervised training data. On the challenging OSWorld benchmark, UI trajectories extracted with W&amp;L consistently enhance both general-purpose and state-of-the-art frameworks in-context, and deliver stronger gains for open-source models under supervised training. These results highlight web-scale human demonstration videos as a practical and scalable foundation for advancing CUAs towards real-world deployment.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for enabling robust robotic perception in dark environments using infrared (IR) stream. IR stream is less susceptible to noise than RGB in low-light conditions. However, it is dominated by active emitter patterns that hinder high-level tasks such as object detection, tracking and localisation. To address this, a U-Net-based architecture is proposed that reconstructs clean IR images from emitter-populated input, improving both image quality and downstream robotic performance. This approach outperforms existing enhancement techniques and enables reliable operation of vision-driven robotic systems across illumination conditions from well-lit to extreme low-light scenes.

Abstract: Structured State-Space Duality (SSD) [Dao & Gu, ICML 2024] is an equivalence between a simple Structured State-Space Model (SSM) and a masked attention mechanism. In particular, a state-space model with a scalar-times-identity state matrix is equivalent to a masked self-attention with a $1$-semiseparable causal mask. Consequently, the same sequence transformation (model) has two algorithmic realizations: as a linear-time $O(T)$ recurrence or as a quadratic-time $O(T^2)$ attention. In this note, we formalize and generalize this duality: (i) we extend SSD from the scalar-identity case to general diagonal SSMs (diagonal state matrices); (ii) we show that these diagonal SSMs match the scalar case's training complexity lower bounds while supporting richer dynamics; (iii) we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which an SSM is equivalent to $1$-semiseparable masked attention; and (iv) we show that such duality fails to extend to standard softmax attention due to rank explosion. Together, these results tighten bridge between recurrent SSMs and Transformers, and widen the design space for expressive yet efficient sequence models.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation technology holds potential to transform multiple domains such as education, marketing, entertainment, and assistive technologies for individuals with visual or reading comprehension challenges, by creating coherent visual content from natural language prompts. From its inception, the field has advanced from adversarial models to diffusion-based models, yielding higher-fidelity, temporally consistent outputs. Yet challenges persist, such as alignment, long-range coherence, and computational efficiency. Addressing this evolving landscape, we present a comprehensive survey of text-to-video generative models, tracing their development from early GANs and VAEs to hybrid Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) architectures, detailing how these models work, what limitations they addressed in their predecessors, and why shifts toward new architectural paradigms were necessary to overcome challenges in quality, coherence, and control. We provide a systematic account of the datasets, which the surveyed text-to-video models were trained and evaluated on, and, to support reproducibility and assess the accessibility of training such models, we detail their training configurations, including their hardware specifications, GPU counts, batch sizes, learning rates, optimizers, epochs, and other key hyperparameters. Further, we outline the evaluation metrics commonly used for evaluating such models and present their performance across standard benchmarks, while also discussing the limitations of these metrics and the emerging shift toward more holistic, perception-aligned evaluation strategies. Finally, drawing from our analysis, we outline the current open challenges and propose a few promising future directions, laying out a perspective for future researchers to explore and build upon in advancing T2V research and applications.

However, existing methods often fail to achieve this balance, yielding representations that are either overly redundant or lacking in task-critical information. We propose an unsupervised approach that learns a highly compressed two-token state representation using a lightweight encoder and a pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder, capitalizing on its strong generative prior. Our representation is efficient, interpretable, and integrates seamlessly into existing VLA-based models, improving performance by 14.3% on LIBERO and 30% in real-world task success with minimal inference overhead. More importantly, we find that the difference between these tokens, obtained via latent interpolation, naturally serves as a highly effective latent action, which can be further decoded into executable robot actions. This emergent capability reveals that our representation captures structured dynamics without explicit supervision. We name our method StaMo for its ability to learn generalizable robotic Motion from compact State representation, which is encoded from static images, challenging the prevalent dependence to learning latent action on complex architectures and video data. The resulting latent actions also enhance policy co-training, outperforming prior methods by 10.4% with improved interpretability. Moreover, our approach scales effectively across diverse data sources, including real-world robot data, simulation, and human egocentric video.

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have become the backbone of modern image editing, yet text prompts alone do not offer adequate control over the editing process. Two properties are especially desirable: disentanglement, where changing one attribute does not unintentionally alter others, and continuous control, where the strength of an edit can be smoothly adjusted. We introduce a method for disentangled and continuous editing through token-level manipulation of text embeddings. The edits are applied by manipulating the embeddings along carefully chosen directions, which control the strength of the target attribute. To identify such directions, we employ a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE), whose sparse latent space exposes semantically isolated dimensions. Our method operates directly on text embeddings without modifying the diffusion process, making it model agnostic and broadly applicable to various image synthesis backbones. Experiments show that it enables intuitive and efficient manipulations with continuous control across diverse attributes and domains.

Abstract: Treating human motion and camera trajectory generation separately overlooks a core principle of cinematography: the tight interplay between actor performance and camera work in the screen space. In this paper, we are the first to cast this task as a text-conditioned joint generation, aiming to maintain consistent on-screen framing while producing two heterogeneous, yet intrinsically linked, modalities: human motion and camera trajectories. We propose a simple, model-agnostic framework that enforces multimodal coherence via an auxiliary modality: the on-screen framing induced by projecting human joints onto the camera. This on-screen framing provides a natural and effective bridge between modalities, promoting consistency and leading to more precise joint distribution. We first design a joint autoencoder that learns a shared latent space, together with a lightweight linear transform from the human and camera latents to a framing latent. We then introduce auxiliary sampling, which exploits this linear transform to steer generation toward a coherent framing modality. To support this task, we also introduce the PulpMotion dataset, a human-motion and camera-trajectory dataset with rich captions, and high-quality human motions. Extensive experiments across DiT- and MAR-based architectures show the generality and effectiveness of our method in generating on-frame coherent human-camera motions, while also achieving gains on textual alignment for both modalities. Our qualitative results yield more cinematographically meaningful framings setting the new state of the art for this task. Code, models and data are available in our \href{https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/vista/projects/2025_pulpmotion_courant/}{project page}.

Abstract: The quality of a face crop in an image is decided by many factors such as camera resolution, distance, and illumination condition. This makes the discrimination of face images with different qualities a challenging problem in realistic applications. However, most existing approaches are designed specifically for high-quality (HQ) or low-quality (LQ) images, and the performances would degrade for the mixed-quality images. Besides, many methods ask for pre-trained feature extractors or other auxiliary structures to support the training and the evaluation. In this paper, we point out that the key to better understand both the HQ and the LQ images simultaneously is to apply different learning methods according to their qualities. We propose a novel quality-guided joint training approach for mixed-quality face recognition, which could simultaneously learn the images of different qualities with a single encoder. Based on quality partition, classification-based method is employed for HQ data learning. Meanwhile, for the LQ images which lack identity information, we learn them with self-supervised image-image contrastive learning. To effectively catch up the model update and improve the discriminability of contrastive learning in our joint training scenario, we further propose a proxy-updated real-time queue to compose the contrastive pairs with features from the genuine encoder. Experiments on the low-quality datasets SCface and Tinyface, the mixed-quality dataset IJB-B, and five high-quality datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach in recognizing face images of different qualities.

Abstract: From a falcon detecting prey to humans recognizing faces, many species exhibit extraordinary abilities in rapid visual localization and classification. These are made possible by a specialized retinal region called the fovea, which provides high acuity at the center of vision while maintaining lower resolution in the periphery. This distinctive spatial organization, preserved along the early visual pathway through retinotopic mapping, is fundamental to biological vision, yet remains largely unexplored in machine learning. Our study investigates how incorporating foveated retinotopy may benefit deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks. By implementing a foveated retinotopic transformation in the input layer of standard ResNet models and re-training them, we maintain comparable classification accuracy while enhancing the network's robustness to scale and rotational perturbations. Although this architectural modification introduces increased sensitivity to fixation point shifts, we demonstrate how this apparent limitation becomes advantageous: variations in classification probabilities across different gaze positions serve as effective indicators for object localization. Our findings suggest that foveated retinotopic mapping encodes implicit knowledge about visual object geometry, offering an efficient solution to the visual search problem - a capability crucial for many living species.

Abstract: Multi-modal test-time adaptation (MM-TTA) adapts models to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging the complementary multi-modal inputs in an online manner. While previous MM-TTA methods for 3D segmentation offer a promising solution by leveraging self-refinement per frame, they suffer from two major limitations: 1) unstable frame-wise predictions caused by temporal inconsistency, and 2) consistently incorrect predictions that violate the assumption of reliable modality guidance. To address these limitations, this work introduces a comprehensive two-fold framework. Firstly, building upon our previous work ReLiable Spatial-temporal Voxels (Latte), we propose Latte++ that better suppresses the unstable frame-wise predictions with more informative geometric correspondences. Instead of utilizing a universal sliding window, Latte++ employs multi-window aggregation to capture more reliable correspondences to better evaluate the local prediction consistency of different semantic categories. Secondly, to tackle the consistently incorrect predictions, we propose Interactive Test-Time Adaptation (ITTA), a flexible add-on to empower effortless human feedback with existing MM-TTA methods. ITTA introduces a novel human-in-the-loop approach that efficiently integrates minimal human feedback through interactive segmentation, requiring only simple point clicks and bounding box annotations. Instead of using independent interactive networks, ITTA employs a lightweight promptable branch with a momentum gradient module to capture and reuse knowledge from scarce human feedback during online inference. Extensive experiments across five MM-TTA benchmarks demonstrate that ITTA achieves consistent and notable improvements with robust performance gains for target classes of interest in challenging imbalanced scenarios, while Latte++ provides complementary benefits for temporal stability.

<title>Evaluating Perceptual Distance Models by Fitting Binomial Distributions to Two-Alternative Forced Choice Data</title>

Abstract: The Two Alternative Forced Choice (2AFC) paradigm offers advantages over the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) paradigm in psychophysics (PF), such as simplicity and robustness. However, when evaluating perceptual distance models, MOS enables direct correlation between model predictions and PF data. In contrast, 2AFC only allows pairwise comparisons to be converted into a quality ranking similar to MOS when comparisons include shared images. In large datasets, like BAPPS, where image patches and distortions are combined randomly, deriving rankings from 2AFC PF data becomes infeasible, as distorted images included in each comparisons are independent. To address this, instead of relying on MOS correlation, researchers have trained ad-hoc neural networks to reproduce 2AFC PF data based on pairs of model distances - a black-box approach with conceptual and operational limitations. This paper introduces a more robust distance-model evaluation method using a pure probabilistic approach, applying maximum likelihood estimation to a binomial decision model. Our method demonstrates superior simplicity, interpretability, flexibility, and computational efficiency, as shown through evaluations of various visual distance models on two 2AFC PF datasets.

Abstract: Industrial 3D face assets creation typically reconstructs topology-consistent face meshes from multi-view images for downstream production. However, high-quality reconstruction usually requires manual processing or specific capture settings. Recently NeRF has shown great advantages in 3D reconstruction, by representing scenes as density and radiance fields and utilizing neural volume rendering for novel view synthesis. Inspired by this, we introduce a novel method which combines explicit mesh with neural volume rendering to optimize geometry of an artist-made template face mesh from multi-view images while keeping the topology unchanged. Our method derives density fields from meshes using distance fields as an intermediary and encodes radiance field in compact tri-planes. To improve convergence, several adaptions tailored for meshes are introduced to the volume rendering. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to previous approaches, validating the feasibility of integrating mesh and neural volume rendering.

Abstract: Learning invariant representations has been the long-standing approach to self-supervised learning. However, recently progress has been made in preserving equivariant properties in representations, yet do so with highly prescribed architectures. In this work, we propose an invariant-equivariant self-supervised architecture that employs Capsule Networks (CapsNets), which have been shown to capture equivariance with respect to novel viewpoints. We demonstrate that the use of CapsNets in equivariant self-supervised architectures achieves improved downstream performance on equivariant tasks with higher efficiency and fewer network parameters. To accommodate the architectural changes of CapsNets, we introduce a new objective function based on entropy minimisation. This approach, which we name CapsIE (Capsule Invariant Equivariant Network), achieves state-of-the-art performance on the equivariant rotation tasks on the 3DIEBench dataset compared to prior equivariant SSL methods, while performing competitively against supervised counterparts. Our results demonstrate the ability of CapsNets to learn complex and generalised representations for large-scale, multi-task datasets compared to previous CapsNet benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/AberdeenML/CapsIE.

Abstract: Modern retrieval systems often struggle with upgrading to new and more powerful models due to the incompatibility of embeddings between the old and new models. This necessitates a costly process known as backfilling, which involves re-computing the embeddings for a large number of data samples. In vision, Backward-compatible Training (BT) has been proposed to ensure that the new model aligns with the old model's embeddings. This paper extends the concept of vision-only BT to the field of cross-modal retrieval, marking the first attempt to address Cross-modal BT (XBT). Our goal is to achieve backward-compatibility between Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) models, such as CLIP, for the cross-modal retrieval task. To address XBT challenges, we propose an efficient solution: a projection module that maps the new model's embeddings to those of the old model. This module, pretrained solely with text data, significantly reduces the number of image-text pairs required for XBT learning, and, once it is pretrained, it avoids using the old model during training. Furthermore, we utilize parameter-efficient training strategies that improve efficiency and preserve the off-the-shelf new model's knowledge by avoiding any modifications. Experimental results on cross-modal retrieval datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of XBT and its potential to enable backfill-free upgrades when a new VLP model emerges.

Abstract: Recent advancements in video diffusion models enable the generation of photorealistic videos with impressive 3D consistency and temporal coherence. However, the extent to which these AI-generated videos simulate the 3D visual world remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Learned 3D Evaluation (L3DE), an objective, quantifiable, and interpretable method for assessing AI-generated videos' ability to simulate the real world in terms of 3D visual qualities and consistencies, without requiring manually labeled defects or quality annotations. Instead of relying on 3D reconstruction, which is prone to failure with in-the-wild videos, L3DE employs a 3D convolutional network, trained on monocular 3D cues of motion, depth, and appearance, to distinguish real from synthetic videos. Confidence scores from L3DE quantify the gap between real and synthetic videos in terms of 3D visual coherence, while a gradient-based visualization pinpoints unrealistic regions, improving interpretability. We validate L3DE through extensive experiments, demonstrating strong alignment with 3D reconstruction quality and human judgments. Our evaluations on leading generative models (e.g., Kling, Sora, and MiniMax) reveal persistent simulation gaps and subtle inconsistencies. Beyond generative video assessment, L3DE extends to broader applications: benchmarking video generation models, serving as a deepfake detector, and enhancing video synthesis by inpainting flagged inconsistencies.

Abstract: Most novel view synthesis methods-including Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-struggle to capture the true high dynamic range (HDR) radiance of scenes. This is primarily due to their dependence on low dynamic range (LDR) images from conventional cameras. Exposure bracketing techniques aim to address this challenge, but they introduce a considerable time burden during the acquisition process. In this work, we introduce PanDORA: PANoramic Dual-Observer Radiance Acquisition, a system designed for the casual, high quality HDR capture of indoor environments. Our approach uses two 360{\deg} cameras mounted on a portable monopod to simultaneously record two panoramic 360{\deg} videos: one with standard exposure and another at fast shutter speed. The resulting video data is processed by a proposed two-stage NeRF-based algorithm, including an algorithm for the fine alignment of the fast- and well-exposed frames, generating non-saturated HDR radiance maps. Compared to existing methods on a novel dataset of real indoor scenes captured with our apparatus and including HDR ground truth lighting, PanDORA achieves superior visual fidelity and provides a scalable solution for capturing real environments in HDR.

Abstract: Category-level object pose and shape estimation from a single depth image has recently drawn research attention due to its potential utility for tasks such as robotics manipulation. The task is particularly challenging because the three unknowns, object pose, object shape, and model-to-measurement correspondences, are compounded together, but only a single view of depth measurements is provided. Most of the prior work heavily relies on data-driven approaches to obtain solutions to at least one of the unknowns, and typically two, risking generalization failures if not designed and trained carefully. The shape representations used in the prior work also mainly focus on point clouds and signed distance fields (SDFs). In stark contrast to the prior work, we approach the problem using an iterative estimation method that does not require learning from pose-annotated data. Moreover, we construct and adopt a novel mesh-based object active shape model (ASM), which additionally maintains vertex connectivity compared to the commonly used point-based object ASM. Our algorithm, ShapeICP, is based on the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm but is equipped with additional features for the category-level pose and shape estimation task. Although not using pose-annotated data, ShapeICP surpasses many data-driven approaches that rely on pose data for training, opening up a new solution space for researchers to consider.

Abstract: We present the "Law of Vision Representation" in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It reveals a strong correlation between the combination of cross-modal alignment, correspondence in vision representation, and MLLM performance. We quantify the two factors using the cross-modal Alignment and Correspondence score (AC score). Through extensive experiments involving thirteen different vision representation settings and evaluations across eight benchmarks, we find that the AC score is linearly correlated to model performance. By leveraging this relationship, we are able to identify and train the optimal vision representation only, which does not require finetuning the language model every time, resulting in a 99.7% reduction in computational cost.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have drawn attention for their ability to generate high-quality images with precise text alignment. However, these models can also be misused to produce inappropriate content. Existing safety measures, which typically rely on text classifiers or ControlNet-like approaches, are often insufficient. Traditional text classifiers rely on large-scale labeled datasets and can be easily bypassed by rephrasing. As diffusion models continue to scale, fine-tuning these safeguards becomes increasingly challenging and lacks flexibility. Recent red-teaming attack researches further underscore the need for a new paradigm to prevent the generation of inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce SteerDiff, a lightweight adaptor module designed to act as an intermediary between user input and the diffusion model, ensuring that generated images adhere to ethical and safety standards with little to no impact on usability. SteerDiff identifies and manipulates inappropriate concepts within the text embedding space to guide the model away from harmful outputs. We conduct extensive experiments across various concept unlearning tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, we benchmark SteerDiff against multiple red-teaming strategies to assess its robustness. Finally, we explore the potential of SteerDiff for concept forgetting tasks, demonstrating its versatility in text-conditioned image generation.

Abstract: Large denoising diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been trained on billions of image-caption pairs to perform text-conditioned image generation. As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilized backpropagation through the denoiser network, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than simple text-to-image generation, or only enforced the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations in the sampled image. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast, high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We show that in denoising diffusion models, we can employ an approximation to Newton's optimization method that allows us to speed up inference and avoid the expensive backpropagation operations. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference methods while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear (inpainting, super-resolution) and non-linear (style-guided generation) constraints. An implementation is provided at https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/fast-constrained-sampling.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) embed aligned image-text pairs into a joint space but often rely on deterministic embeddings, assuming a one-to-one correspondence between images and texts. This oversimplifies real-world relationships, which are inherently many-to-many, with multiple captions describing a single image and vice versa. We introduce Probabilistic Language-Image Pre-training (ProLIP), the first probabilistic VLM pre-trained on a billion-scale image-text dataset using only probabilistic objectives, achieving a strong zero-shot capability (e.g., 74.6% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy with ViT-B/16). ProLIP efficiently estimates uncertainty by an "uncertainty token" without extra parameters. We also introduce a novel inclusion loss that enforces distributional inclusion relationships between image-text pairs and between original and masked inputs. Experiments demonstrate that, by leveraging uncertainty estimates, ProLIP benefits downstream tasks and aligns with intuitive notions of uncertainty, e.g., shorter texts being more uncertain and more general inputs including specific ones. Utilizing text uncertainties, we further improve ImageNet accuracy from 74.6% to 75.8% (under a few-shot setting), supporting the practical advantages of our probabilistic approach.

Abstract: Coral reef imagery offers critical data for monitoring ecosystem health, in particular as the ease of image datasets continues to rapidly expand. Whilst semi-automated analytical platforms for reef imagery are becoming more available, the dominant approaches face fundamental limitations. To address these challenges, we propose CoralSCOP-LAT, a coral reef image analysis and labeling tool that automatically segments and analyzes coral regions. By leveraging advanced machine learning models tailored for coral reef segmentation, CoralSCOP-LAT enables users to generate dense segmentation masks with minimal manual effort, significantly enhancing both the labeling efficiency and precision of coral reef analysis. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that CoralSCOP-LAT surpasses existing coral reef analysis tools in terms of time efficiency, accuracy, precision, and flexibility. CoralSCOP-LAT, therefore, not only accelerates the coral reef annotation process but also assists users in obtaining high-quality coral reef segmentation and analysis outcomes.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has been successfully used to align large language models (LLMs) according to human preferences, and more recently it has also been applied to improving the quality of text-to-image diffusion models. However, DPO-based methods such as SPO, Diffusion-DPO, and D3PO are highly susceptible to overfitting and reward hacking, especially when the generative model is optimized to fit out-of-distribution during prolonged training. To overcome these challenges and stabilize the training of diffusion models, we introduce a self-entropy regularization mechanism in reinforcement learning from human feedback. This enhancement improves DPO training by encouraging broader exploration and greater robustness. Our regularization technique effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to improved stability and enhanced image quality across the latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating human feedback with self-entropy regularization can significantly boost image diversity and specificity, achieving state-of-the-art results on key image generation metrics.

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Recent methods extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via additional deformation fields and apply explicit constraints like motion flow to guide the deformation. However, they learn motion changes from individual timestamps independently, making it challenging to reconstruct complex scenes, particularly when dealing with violent movement, extreme-shaped geometries, or reflective surfaces. To address the above issue, we design a plug-and-play module called TimeFormer to enable existing deformable 3D Gaussians reconstruction methods with the ability to implicitly model motion patterns from a learning perspective. Specifically, TimeFormer includes a Cross-Temporal Transformer Encoder, which adaptively learns the temporal relationships of deformable 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we propose a two-stream optimization strategy that transfers the motion knowledge learned from TimeFormer to the base stream during the training phase. This allows us to remove TimeFormer during inference, thereby preserving the original rendering speed. Extensive experiments in the multi-view and monocular dynamic scenes validate qualitative and quantitative improvement brought by TimeFormer. Project Page: https://patrickddj.github.io/TimeFormer/

Abstract: The development of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enables the evaluation of image quality through natural language descriptions. This advancement allows for more detailed assessments. However, these MLLM-based IQA methods primarily rely on general contextual descriptions, sometimes limiting fine-grained quality assessment. To address this limitation, we introduce a new image quality assessment (IQA) task paradigm, **grounding-IQA**. This paradigm integrates multimodal referring and grounding with IQA to realize more fine-grained quality perception, thereby extending existing IQA. Specifically, grounding-IQA comprises two subtasks: grounding-IQA-description (GIQA-DES) and visual question answering (GIQA-VQA). GIQA-DES involves detailed descriptions with precise locations (e.g., bounding boxes), while GIQA-VQA focuses on quality QA for local regions. To realize grounding-IQA, we construct a corresponding dataset, GIQA-160K, through our proposed automated annotation pipeline. Furthermore, we develop a well-designed benchmark, GIQA-Bench. The benchmark evaluates the grounding-IQA performance from three perspectives: description quality, VQA accuracy, and grounding precision. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method facilitates the more fine-grained IQA application. Code: https://github.com/zhengchen1999/Grounding-IQA.

Abstract: Under pure textual modality, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in complex reasoning tasks by decomposing them into simpler sub-problems. However, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still struggle with some seemingly straightforward visual tasks, such as counting and solving jigsaw puzzles. We argue that these tasks challenge the ability of visual-to-textual conversion, where MLLMs convert visual information perceived from the input scene, to textual information for further reasoning and generating the answer. If the complexity of the visual input is beyond the perceptual capability of the MLLMs, without decomposing this conversion process, simply scaling inference-time reasoning cannot solve the task because it repeatedly encounters the same perceptual bottleneck. We propose an approach, autonomous imagination, to enable MLLMs to iteratively modify visual inputs (e.g. isolating objects, rearranging puzzle pieces) into intermediate visual states, decomposing visual-to-textual conversion into closed-loop visual modification steps. We show that, without any retraining, MLLMs can now solve tasks initially beyond their perceptual capability, highlighting that closed-loop visual modification can be an effective way of decomposing the visual reasoning task into solvable substeps.

Abstract: The field of video generation has made remarkable advancements, yet there remains a pressing need for a clear, systematic recipe that can guide the development of robust and scalable models. In this work, we present a comprehensive study that systematically explores the interplay of model architectures, training recipes, and data curation strategies, culminating in a simple and scalable text-image-conditioned video generation method, named STIV. Our framework integrates image condition into a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) through frame replacement, while incorporating text conditioning via a joint image-text conditional classifier-free guidance. This design enables STIV to perform both text-to-video (T2V) and text-image-to-video (TI2V) tasks simultaneously. Additionally, STIV can be easily extended to various applications, such as video prediction, frame interpolation, multi-view generation, and long video generation, etc. With comprehensive ablation studies on T2I, T2V, and TI2V, STIV demonstrate strong performance, despite its simple design. An 8.7B model with 512 resolution achieves 83.1 on VBench T2V, surpassing both leading open and closed-source models like CogVideoX-5B, Pika, Kling, and Gen-3. The same-sized model also achieves a state-of-the-art result of 90.1 on VBench I2V task at 512 resolution. By providing a transparent and extensible recipe for building cutting-edge video generation models, we aim to empower future research and accelerate progress toward more versatile and reliable video generation solutions.

Abstract: Crop row detection enables autonomous robots to navigate in gps denied environments. Vision based strategies often struggle in the environments due to gaps, curved crop rows and require post-processing steps. Furthermore, labeling crop rows in under the canopy environments accurately is very difficult due to occlusions. This study introduces RowDetr, an efficient end-to-end transformer-based neural network for crop row detection in precision agriculture. RowDetr leverages a lightweight backbone and a hybrid encoder to model straight, curved, or occluded crop rows with high precision. Central to the architecture is a novel polynomial representation that enables direct parameterization of crop rows, eliminating computationally expensive post-processing. Key innovations include a PolySampler module and multi-scale deformable attention, which work together with PolyOptLoss, an energy-based loss function designed to optimize geometric alignment between predicted and the annotated crop rows, while also enhancing robustness against labeling noise. RowDetr was evaluated against other state-of-the-art end-to-end crop row detection methods like AgroNav and RolColAttention on a diverse dataset of 6,962 high-resolution images, used for training, validation, and testing across multiple crop types with annotated crop rows. The system demonstrated superior performance, achieved an F1 score up to 0.74 and a lane position deviation as low as 0.405. Furthermore, RowDetr achieves a real-time inference latency of 6.7ms, which was optimized to 3.5ms with INT8 quantization on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX. This work highlighted the critical efficiency of polynomial parameterization, making RowDetr particularly suitable for deployment on edge computing devices in agricultural robotics and autonomous farming equipment.

Abstract: The increasing demand for immersive AR/VR applications and spatial intelligence has heightened the need to generate high-quality scene-level and 360${\deg}$ panoramic video. However, most video diffusion models are constrained by limited resolution and aspect ratio, which restricts their applicability to scene-level dynamic content synthesis. In this work, we propose $\textbf{DynamicScaler}$, addressing these challenges by enabling spatially scalable and panoramic dynamic scene synthesis that preserves coherence across panoramic scenes of arbitrary size. Specifically, we introduce a Offset Shifting Denoiser, facilitating efficient, synchronous, and coherent denoising panoramic dynamic scenes via a diffusion model with fixed resolution through a seamless rotating Window, which ensures seamless boundary transitions and consistency across the entire panoramic space, accommodating varying resolutions and aspect ratios. Additionally, we employ a Global Motion Guidance mechanism to ensure both local detail fidelity and global motion continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves superior content and motion quality in panoramic scene-level video generation, offering a training-free, efficient, and scalable solution for immersive dynamic scene creation with constant VRAM consumption regardless of the output video resolution.

Abstract: Source-free domain-adaptive object detection is an interesting but scarcely addressed topic. It aims at adapting a source-pretrained detector to a distinct target domain without resorting to source data during adaptation. So far, there is no data augmentation scheme tailored to source-free domain-adaptive object detection. To this end, this paper presents a novel data augmentation approach that cuts out target image regions where the detector is confident, augments them along with their respective pseudo-labels, and joins them into a challenging target image to adapt the detector. As the source data is out of reach during adaptation, we implement our approach within a teacher-student learning paradigm to ensure that the model does not collapse during the adaptation procedure. We evaluated our approach on three adaptation benchmarks of traffic scenes, scoring new state-of-the-art on two of them.

<title>Fast-RF-Shimming: Accelerate RF Shimming in 7T MRI using Deep Learning</title>

Abstract: Ultrahigh field (UHF) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers an elevated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), enabling exceptionally high spatial resolution that benefits both clinical diagnostics and advanced research. However, the jump to higher fields introduces complications, particularly transmit radiofrequency (RF) field ($B_{1}^{+}$) inhomogeneities, manifesting as uneven flip angles and image intensity irregularities. These artifacts can degrade image quality and impede broader clinical adoption. Traditional RF shimming methods, such as Magnitude Least Squares (MLS) optimization, effectively mitigate $B_{1}^{+}$ inhomogeneity, but remain time-consuming. Recent machine learning approaches, including RF Shim Prediction by Iteratively Projected Ridge Regression and other deep learning architectures, suggest alternative pathways. Although these approaches show promise, challenges such as extensive training periods, limited network complexity, and practical data requirements persist. In this paper, we introduce a holistic learning-based framework called Fast-RF-Shimming, which achieves a 5000x speed-up compared to the traditional MLS method. In the initial phase, we employ random-initialized Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) to derive the desired reference shimming weights from multi-channel $B_{1}^{+}$ fields. Next, we train a Residual Network (ResNet) to map $B_{1}^{+}$ fields directly to the ultimate RF shimming outputs, incorporating the confidence parameter into its loss function. Finally, we design Non-uniformity Field Detector (NFD), an optional post-processing step, to ensure the extreme non-uniform outcomes are identified. Comparative evaluations with standard MLS optimization underscore notable gains in both processing speed and predictive accuracy, which indicates that our technique shows a promising solution for addressing persistent inhomogeneity challenges.

Abstract: Existing underwater image restoration (UIR) methods generally only handle color distortion or jointly address color and haze issues, but they often overlook the more complex degradations that can occur in underwater scenes. To address this limitation, we propose a Universal Underwater Image Restoration method, termed as UniUIR, considering the complex scenario of real-world underwater mixed distortions as an all-in-one manner. To decouple degradation-specific issues and explore the inter-correlations among various degradations in UIR task, we designed the Mamba Mixture-of-Experts module. This module enables each expert to identify distinct types of degradation and collaboratively extract task-specific priors while maintaining global feature representation based on linear complexity. Building upon this foundation, to enhance degradation representation and address the task conflicts that arise when handling multiple types of degradation, we introduce the spatial-frequency prior generator. This module extracts degradation prior information in both spatial and frequency domains, and adaptively selects the most appropriate task-specific prompts based on image content, thereby improving the accuracy of image restoration. Finally, to more effectively address complex, region-dependent distortions in UIR task, we incorporate depth information derived from a large-scale pre-trained depth prediction model, thereby enabling the network to perceive and leverage depth variations across different image regions to handle localized degradation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniUIR can produce more attractive results across qualitative and quantitative comparisons, and shows strong generalization than state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present WonderHuman to reconstruct dynamic human avatars from a monocular video for high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Previous dynamic human avatar reconstruction methods typically require the input video to have full coverage of the observed human body. However, in daily practice, one typically has access to limited viewpoints, such as monocular front-view videos, making it a cumbersome task for previous methods to reconstruct the unseen parts of the human avatar. To tackle the issue, we present WonderHuman, which leverages 2D generative diffusion model priors to achieve high-quality, photorealistic reconstructions of dynamic human avatars from monocular videos, including accurate rendering of unseen body parts. Our approach introduces a Dual-Space Optimization technique, applying Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) in both canonical and observation spaces to ensure visual consistency and enhance realism in dynamic human reconstruction. Additionally, we present a View Selection strategy and Pose Feature Injection to enforce the consistency between SDS predictions and observed data, ensuring pose-dependent effects and higher fidelity in the reconstructed avatar. In the experiments, our method achieves SOTA performance in producing photorealistic renderings from the given monocular video, particularly for those challenging unseen parts.

Abstract: Controllable video generation remains a significant challenge, despite recent advances in generating high-quality and consistent videos. Most existing methods for controlling video generation treat the video as a whole, neglecting intricate fine-grained spatiotemporal relationships, which limits both control precision and efficiency. In this paper, we propose Controllable Video Generative Adversarial Networks (CoVoGAN) to disentangle the video concepts, thus facilitating efficient and independent control over individual concepts. Specifically, following the minimal change principle, we first disentangle static and dynamic latent variables. We then leverage the sufficient change property to achieve component-wise identifiability of dynamic latent variables, enabling disentangled control of video generation. To establish the theoretical foundation, we provide a rigorous analysis demonstrating the identifiability of our approach. Building on these theoretical insights, we design a Temporal Transition Module to disentangle latent dynamics. To enforce the minimal change principle and sufficient change property, we minimize the dimensionality of latent dynamic variables and impose temporal conditional independence. To validate our approach, we integrate this module as a plug-in for GANs. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on various video generation benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves generation quality and controllability across diverse real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Convolutional networks, transformers, hybrid models, and Mamba-based architectures have demonstrated strong performance across various medical image classification tasks. However, these methods were primarily designed to classify clean images using labeled data. In contrast, real-world clinical data often involve image corruptions that are unique to multi-center studies and stem from variations in imaging equipment across manufacturers. In this paper, we introduce the Medical Vision Transformer (MedViTV2), a novel architecture incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers into the transformer architecture for the first time, aiming for generalized medical image classification. We have developed an efficient KAN block to reduce computational load while enhancing the accuracy of the original MedViT. Additionally, to counteract the fragility of our MedViT when scaled up, we propose an enhanced Dilated Neighborhood Attention (DiNA), an adaptation of the efficient fused dot-product attention kernel capable of capturing global context and expanding receptive fields to scale the model effectively and addressing feature collapse issues. Moreover, a hierarchical hybrid strategy is introduced to stack our Local Feature Perception and Global Feature Perception blocks in an efficient manner, which balances local and global feature perceptions to boost performance. Extensive experiments on 17 medical image classification datasets and 12 corrupted medical image datasets demonstrate that MedViTV2 achieved state-of-the-art results in 27 out of 29 experiments with reduced computational complexity. MedViTV2 is 44\% more computationally efficient than the previous version and significantly enhances accuracy, achieving improvements of 4.6\% on MedMNIST, 5.8\% on NonMNIST, and 13.4\% on the MedMNIST-C benchmark.

Abstract: Realistic human geometry generation is an important yet challenging task, requiring both the preservation of fine clothing details and the accurate modeling of clothing-body interactions. To tackle this challenge, we build upon Geometry distributions, a recently proposed representation that can model a single human geometry with high fidelity using a flow matching model. However, extending a single-geometry distribution to a dataset is non-trivial and inefficient for large-scale learning. To address this, we propose a new geometry distribution model by two key techniques: (1) encoding distributions as 2D feature maps rather than network parameters, and (2) using SMPL models as the domain instead of Gaussian and refining the associated flow velocity field. We then design a generative framework adopting a two staged training paradigm analogous to state-of-the-art image and 3D generative models. In the first stage, we compress geometry distributions into a latent space using a diffusion flow model; the second stage trains another flow model on this latent space. We validate our approach on two key tasks: pose-conditioned random avatar generation and avatar-consistent novel pose synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 57% improvement in geometry quality.

Abstract: Existing novel object 6D pose estimation methods typically rely on CAD models or dense reference views, which are both difficult to acquire. Using only a single reference view is more scalable, but challenging due to large pose discrepancies and limited geometric and spatial information. To address these issues, we propose a Single-Reference-based novel object 6D (SinRef-6D) pose estimation method. Our key idea is to iteratively establish point-wise alignment in a common coordinate system based on state space models (SSMs). Specifically, iterative object-space point-wise alignment can effectively handle large pose discrepancies, while our proposed RGB and Points SSMs can capture long-range dependencies and spatial information from a single view, offering linear complexity and superior spatial modeling capability. Once pre-trained on synthetic data, SinRef-6D can estimate the 6D pose of a novel object using only a single reference view, without requiring retraining or a CAD model. Extensive experiments on six popular datasets and real-world robotic scenes demonstrate that we achieve on-par performance with CAD-based and dense reference view-based methods, despite operating in the more challenging single reference setting. Code will be released at https://github.com/CNJianLiu/SinRef-6D.

Abstract: Visual prompt tuning (VPT), i.e., fine-tuning some lightweight prompt tokens, provides an efficient and effective approach for adapting pre-trained models to various downstream tasks. However, most prior art indiscriminately uses a fixed prompt distribution across different tasks, neglecting the importance of each block varying depending on the task. In this paper, we introduce adaptive distribution optimization (ADO) by tackling two key questions: (1) How to appropriately and formally define ADO, and (2) How to design an adaptive distribution strategy guided by this definition? Through empirical analysis, we first confirm that properly adjusting the distribution significantly improves VPT performance, and further uncover a key insight that a nested relationship exists between ADO and VPT. Based on these findings, we propose a new VPT framework, termed PRO-VPT (iterative Prompt RelOcation-based VPT), which adaptively adjusts the distribution built upon a nested optimization formulation. Specifically, we develop a prompt relocation strategy derived from this formulation, comprising two steps: pruning idle prompts from prompt-saturated blocks, followed by allocating these prompts to the most prompt-needed blocks. By iteratively performing prompt relocation and VPT, our proposal can adaptively learn the optimal prompt distribution in a nested optimization-based manner, thereby unlocking the full potential of VPT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal significantly outperforms advanced VPT methods, e.g., PRO-VPT surpasses VPT by 1.6 pp and 2.0 pp average accuracy, leading prompt-based methods to state-of-the-art performance on VTAB-1k and FGVC benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has exhibited impressive generation capabilities but faces great challenges due to its high computational complexity. To address this issue, various methods, notably feature caching, have been introduced. However, these approaches focus on aligning non-cache diffusion without analyzing why caching damage the generation processes. In this paper, we first confirm that the cache greatly amplifies the exposure bias, resulting in a decline in the generation quality. However, directly applying noise scaling is challenging for this issue due to the non-smoothness of exposure bias. We found that this phenomenon stems from the mismatch between its frequency response characteristics and the simple cache of Attention and MLP. Since these two components exhibit unique preferences for frequency signals, which provides us with a caching strategy to separate Attention and MLP to achieve an enhanced fit of exposure bias and reduce it. Based on this, we introduced FEB-Cache, a joint caching strategy that aligns with the non-exposed bias diffusion process (which gives us a higher performance cap) of caching Attention and MLP based on the frequency-guided cache table. Our approach combines a comprehensive understanding of the caching mechanism and offers a new perspective on leveraging caching to accelerate the diffusion process. Empirical results indicate that FEB-Cache optimizes model performance while concurrently facilitating acceleration. Code is available at https://github.com/aSleepyTree/EB-Cache.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models enable photorealistic image generation, but they also risk producing malicious content, such as NSFW images. To mitigate risk, concept erasure methods are studied to facilitate the model to unlearn specific concepts. However, current studies struggle to fully erase malicious concepts implicitly embedded in prompts (e.g., metaphorical expressions or adversarial prompts) while preserving the model's normal generation capability. To address this challenge, our study proposes TRCE, using a two-stage concept erasure strategy to achieve an effective trade-off between reliable erasure and knowledge preservation. Firstly, TRCE starts by erasing the malicious semantics implicitly embedded in textual prompts. By identifying a critical mapping objective(i.e., the [EoT] embedding), we optimize the cross-attention layers to map malicious prompts to contextually similar prompts but with safe concepts. This step prevents the model from being overly influenced by malicious semantics during the denoising process. Following this, considering the deterministic properties of the sampling trajectory of the diffusion model, TRCE further steers the early denoising prediction toward the safe direction and away from the unsafe one through contrastive learning, thus further avoiding the generation of malicious content. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of TRCE on multiple malicious concept erasure benchmarks, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in erasing malicious concepts while better preserving the model's original generation ability. The code is available at: http://github.com/ddgoodgood/TRCE. CAUTION: This paper includes model-generated content that may contain offensive material.

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large-scale natural images are widely adapted to various cross-domain low-resource downstream tasks, benefiting from generalizable and transferable patterns captured by their representations. However, these representations are later found to gradually vanish during finetuning, accompanied by a degradation of model's original generalizability. In this paper, we argue that such tasks can be effectively adapted without sacrificing the benefits of pretrained representations. We approach this by introducing \textit{Representation Invariance FineTuning (RIFT)}, a regularization that maximizes the representation similarity between pretrained and finetuned models by leveraging orthogonal invariance of manifolds in a computationally efficient way. Experiments demonstrate that our method is compatible with mainstream finetuning methods, offering competitive or even enhanced performance and better preservation of the generalizability.

Pitfalls of each metric are discussed, and an analysis through the lens of expert 3D modelers' preferences is presented. A set of systematic "unit tests" are proposed to empirically verify desirable properties, and context aware recommendations regarding which metric to use depending on application are provided. Finally, a learned metric distilled from human expert judgments is proposed and analyzed. The source code is available at https://github.com/s23dr/wireframe-metrics-iccv2025

<title>Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Scene Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Gaussian splatting has emerged as a powerful tool for high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic scenes. However, existing methods primarily rely on implicit motion representations, such as encoding motions into neural networks or per-Gaussian parameters, which makes it difficult to further manipulate the reconstructed motions. This lack of explicit controllability limits existing methods to replaying recorded motions only, which hinders a wider application in robotics. To address this, we propose Motion Blender Gaussian Splatting (MBGS), a novel framework that uses motion graphs as an explicit and sparse motion representation. The motion of a graph's links is propagated to individual Gaussians via dual quaternion skinning, with learnable weight painting functions that determine the influence of each link. The motion graphs and 3D Gaussians are jointly optimized from input videos via differentiable rendering. Experiments show that MBGS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the highly challenging iPhone dataset while being competitive on HyperNeRF. We demonstrate the application potential of our method in animating novel object poses, synthesizing real robot demonstrations, and predicting robot actions through visual planning.

Abstract: Current text-to-3D methods excel at generating single objects but falter on compositional prompts. We argue this failure is fundamental to their optimization schedules, as simultaneous or iterative heuristics predictably collapse under a combinatorial explosion of conflicting gradients, leading to entangled geometry or catastrophic divergence. In this paper, we reframe the core challenge of compositional generation as one of optimization scheduling. We introduce DecompDreamer, a framework built on a novel staged optimization strategy that functions as an implicit curriculum. Our method first establishes a coherent structural scaffold by prioritizing inter-object relationships before shifting to the high-fidelity refinement of individual components. This temporal decoupling of competing objectives provides a robust solution to gradient conflict. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on diverse compositional prompts demonstrate that DecompDreamer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in fidelity, disentanglement, and spatial coherence.

Abstract: The availability of large language models and open-vocabulary object perception methods enables more flexibility for domestic service robots. The large variability of domestic tasks can be addressed without implementing each task individually by providing the robot with a task description along with appropriate environment information. In this work, we propose LIAM - an end-to-end model that predicts action transcripts based on language, image, action, and map inputs. Language and image inputs are encoded with a CLIP backbone, for which we designed two pre-training tasks to fine-tune its weights and pre-align the latent spaces. We evaluate our method on the ALFRED dataset, a simulator-generated benchmark for domestic tasks. Our results demonstrate the importance of pre-aligning embedding spaces from different modalities and the efficacy of incorporating semantic maps.

Abstract: Evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in urban driving contexts remains challenging, as existing benchmarks rely on open-ended responses that are ambiguous, annotation-intensive, and inconsistent to score. This lack of standardized evaluation slows progress toward safe and reliable AI for urban mobility. We introduce AutoDrive-QA, the first benchmark that systematically converts open-ended driving QA datasets (DriveLM, NuScenes-QA, LingoQA) into structured multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with distractors grounded in five realistic error categories: Driving Domain Misconceptions, Logical Inconsistencies, Misinterpreted Sensor Inputs, Computational Oversights, and Question Ambiguity. This framework enables reproducible and interpretable evaluation of VLMs across perception, prediction, and planning tasks in complex urban scenes. Experiments show that fine-tuning LLaVA-1.5-7B improves accuracy by about six percentage points across tasks, GPT-4V achieves the strongest zero-shot performance with up to 69.8% accuracy, and Qwen2-VL models also perform competitively, particularly in multi-view settings. Moreover, traditional metrics such as BLEU and CIDEr fail to distinguish strong from weak models. By providing an objective, domain-grounded evaluation protocol, AutoDrive-QA contributes to more transparent benchmarking of urban AI systems, supporting the development of safer and more trustworthy autonomous driving technologies for smart cities.

<title>Jasmine: Harnessing Diffusion Prior for Self-supervised Depth Estimation</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Jasmine, the first Stable Diffusion (SD)-based self-supervised framework for monocular depth estimation, which effectively harnesses SD's visual priors to enhance the sharpness and generalization of unsupervised prediction. Previous SD-based methods are all supervised since adapting diffusion models for dense prediction requires high-precision supervision. In contrast, self-supervised reprojection suffers from inherent challenges (e.g., occlusions, texture-less regions, illumination variance), and the predictions exhibit blurs and artifacts that severely compromise SD's latent priors. To resolve this, we construct a novel surrogate task of hybrid image reconstruction. Without any additional supervision, it preserves the detail priors of SD models by reconstructing the images themselves while preventing depth estimation from degradation. Furthermore, to address the inherent misalignment between SD's scale and shift invariant estimation and self-supervised scale-invariant depth estimation, we build the Scale-Shift GRU. It not only bridges this distribution gap but also isolates the fine-grained texture of SD output against the interference of reprojection loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Jasmine achieves SoTA performance on the KITTI benchmark and exhibits superior zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets.

Abstract: We present MetaSpatial, the first reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework designed to enhance 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), enabling real-time 3D scene generation without the need for hard-coded optimizations. MetaSpatial addresses two core challenges: (i) the lack of internalized 3D spatial reasoning in VLMs, which limits their ability to generate realistic layouts, and (ii) the inefficiency of traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for layout generation tasks, as perfect ground truth annotations are unavailable. Our key innovation is a multi-turn RL-based optimization mechanism that integrates physics-aware constraints and rendered image evaluations, ensuring generated 3D layouts are coherent, physically plausible, and aesthetically consistent. Methodologically, MetaSpatial introduces an adaptive, iterative reasoning process, where the VLM refines spatial arrangements over multiple turns by analyzing rendered outputs, improving scene coherence progressively. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MetaSpatial significantly enhances the spatial consistency and formatting stability of various scale models. Post-training, object placements are more realistic, aligned, and functionally coherent, validating the effectiveness of RL for 3D spatial reasoning in metaverse, AR/VR, digital twins, and game development applications. Our code, data, and training pipeline are publicly available at https://github.com/PzySeere/MetaSpatial.

Abstract: Visual reasoning abilities play a crucial role in understanding complex multimodal data, advancing both domain-specific applications and artificial general intelligence (AGI). Existing methods enhance Vision-Language Models (VLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning using meticulously annotated data. However, this approach may lead to overfitting and cognitive rigidity, limiting the model's generalization ability under domain shifts and reducing real-world applicability. To overcome these limitations, we propose Reason-RFT, a two-stage reinforcement fine-tuning framework for visual reasoning. First, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with curated CoT data activates the reasoning potential of VLMs. This is followed by reinforcement learning based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which generates multiple reasoning-response pairs to enhance adaptability to domain shifts. To evaluate Reason-RFT, we reconstructed a comprehensive dataset covering visual counting, structural perception, and spatial transformation, serving as a benchmark for systematic assessment across three key dimensions. Experimental results highlight three advantages: (1) performance enhancement, with Reason-RFT achieving state-of-the-art results and outperforming both open-source and proprietary models; (2) generalization superiority, maintaining robust performance under domain shifts across various tasks; and (3) data efficiency, excelling in few-shot learning scenarios and surpassing full-dataset SFT baselines. Reason-RFT introduces a novel training paradigm for visual reasoning and marks a significant step forward in multimodal research. Project website: https://tanhuajie.github.io/ReasonRFT

Abstract: Face video quality assessment (FVQA) deserves to be explored in addition to general video quality assessment (VQA), as face videos are the primary content on social media platforms and human visual system (HVS) is particularly sensitive to human faces. However, FVQA is rarely explored due to the lack of large-scale FVQA datasets. To fill this gap, we present the first large-scale in-the-wild FVQA dataset, FVQ-20K, which contains 20,000 in-the-wild face videos together with corresponding mean opinion score (MOS) annotations. Along with the FVQ-20K dataset, we further propose a specialized FVQA method named FVQ-Rater to achieve human-like rating and scoring for face video, which is the first attempt to explore the potential of large multimodal models (LMMs) for the FVQA task. Concretely, we elaborately extract multi-dimensional features including spatial features, temporal features, and face-specific features (i.e., portrait features and face embeddings) to provide comprehensive visual information, and take advantage of the LoRA-based instruction tuning technique to achieve quality-specific fine-tuning, which shows superior performance on both FVQ-20K and CFVQA datasets. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analysis demonstrate the significant potential of the FVQ-20K dataset and FVQ-Rater method in promoting the development of FVQA.

<title>From Gaze to Insight: Bridging Human Visual Attention and Vision Language Model Explanation for Weakly-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation</title>

Abstract: Medical image segmentation remains challenging due to the high cost of pixel-level annotations for training. In the context of weak supervision, clinician gaze data captures regions of diagnostic interest; however, its sparsity limits its use for segmentation. In contrast, vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic context through textual descriptions but lack the explanation precision required. Recognizing that neither source alone suffices, we propose a teacher-student framework that integrates both gaze and language supervision, leveraging their complementary strengths. Our key insight is that gaze data indicates where clinicians focus during diagnosis, while VLMs explain why those regions are significant. To implement this, the teacher model first learns from gaze points enhanced by VLM-generated descriptions of lesion morphology, establishing a foundation for guiding the student model. The teacher then directs the student through three strategies: (1) Multi-scale feature alignment to fuse visual cues with textual semantics; (2) Confidence-weighted consistency constraints to focus on reliable predictions; (3) Adaptive masking to limit error propagation in uncertain areas. Experiments on the Kvasir-SEG, NCI-ISBI, and ISIC datasets show that our method achieves Dice scores of 80.78%, 80.53%, and 84.22%, respectively-improving 3-5% over gaze baselines without increasing the annotation burden. By preserving correlations among predictions, gaze data, and lesion descriptions, our framework also maintains clinical interpretability. This work illustrates how integrating human visual attention with AI-generated semantic context can effectively overcome the limitations of individual weak supervision signals, thereby advancing the development of deployable, annotation-efficient medical AI systems.

Abstract: Mamba-based models have recently demonstrated significant potential in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, primarily due to their ability to perform contextual modeling with linear computational complexity. However, existing Mamba-based approaches often overlook the directional modeling heterogeneity across different land-cover types, leading to limited classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose MambaMoE, a novel spectral-spatial Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, which represents the first MoE-based approach in the HSI classification domain. Specifically, we design a Mixture of Mamba Expert Block (MoMEB) that performs adaptive spectral-spatial feature modeling via a sparse expert activation mechanism. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty-guided corrective learning (UGCL) strategy that encourages the model to focus on complex regions prone to prediction ambiguity. This strategy dynamically samples supervision signals from regions with high predictive uncertainty, guiding the model to adaptively refine feature representations and thereby enhancing its focus on challenging areas. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public HSI benchmark datasets show that MambaMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both classification accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing advanced methods, particularly Mamba-based ones. The code will be available online at https://github.com/YichuXu/MambaMoE.

Abstract: Text-driven object insertion in 3D scenes is an emerging task that enables intuitive scene editing through natural language. However, existing 2D editing-based methods often rely on spatial priors such as 2D masks or 3D bounding boxes, and they struggle to ensure consistency of the inserted object. These limitations hinder flexibility and scalability in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose FreeInsert, a novel framework that leverages foundation models including MLLMs, LGMs, and diffusion models to disentangle object generation from spatial placement. This enables unsupervised and flexible object insertion in 3D scenes without spatial priors. FreeInsert starts with an MLLM-based parser that extracts structured semantics, including object types, spatial relationships, and attachment regions, from user instructions. These semantics guide both the reconstruction of the inserted object for 3D consistency and the learning of its degrees of freedom. We leverage the spatial reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to initialize object pose and scale. A hierarchical, spatially aware refinement stage further integrates spatial semantics and MLLM-inferred priors to enhance placement. Finally, the appearance of the object is improved using the inserted-object image to enhance visual fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that FreeInsert achieves semantically coherent, spatially precise, and visually realistic 3D insertions without relying on spatial priors, offering a user-friendly and flexible editing experience.

Abstract: The rapid extension of context windows in large vision-language models has given rise to long-context vision-language models (LCVLMs), which are capable of handling hundreds of images with interleaved text tokens in a single forward pass. In this work, we introduce MMLongBench, the first benchmark covering a diverse set of long-context vision-language tasks, to evaluate LCVLMs effectively and thoroughly. MMLongBench is composed of 13,331 examples spanning five different categories of downstream tasks, such as Visual RAG and Many-Shot ICL. It also provides broad coverage of image types, including various natural and synthetic images. To assess the robustness of the models to different input lengths, all examples are delivered at five standardized input lengths (8K-128K tokens) via a cross-modal tokenization scheme that combines vision patches and text tokens. Through a thorough benchmarking of 46 closed-source and open-source LCVLMs, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the current models' vision-language long-context ability. Our results show that: i) performance on a single task is a weak proxy for overall long-context capability; ii) both closed-source and open-source models face challenges in long-context vision-language tasks, indicating substantial room for future improvement; iii) models with stronger reasoning ability tend to exhibit better long-context performance. By offering wide task coverage, various image types, and rigorous length control, MMLongBench provides the missing foundation for diagnosing and advancing the next generation of LCVLMs.

Abstract: Transformers have transformed modern machine learning, driving breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. At the core of their success lies the attention mechanism, which enables the modeling of global dependencies among input tokens. However, we reveal that the attention block in transformers suffers from inherent ill-conditioning, which hampers gradient-based optimization and leads to inefficient training. To address this, we develop a theoretical framework that establishes a direct relationship between the conditioning of the attention block and that of the embedded tokenized data. Building on this insight, we introduce conditioned embedded tokens, a method that systematically modifies the embedded tokens to improve the conditioning of the attention mechanism. Our analysis demonstrates that this approach significantly mitigates ill-conditioning, leading to more stable and efficient training. We validate our methodology across various transformer architectures, achieving consistent improvements in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and natural language processing, highlighting its broad applicability and effectiveness.

Abstract: Polarization images provide rich physical information that is fundamentally absent from standard RGB images, benefiting a wide range of computer vision applications such as reflection separation and material classification. However, the acquisition of polarization images typically requires additional optical components, which increases both the cost and the complexity of the applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task: RGB-to-polarization image estimation, which aims to infer polarization information directly from RGB images. In this work, we establish the first comprehensive benchmark for this task by leveraging existing polarization datasets and evaluating a diverse set of state-of-the-art deep learning models, including both restoration-oriented and generative architectures. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis, our benchmark not only establishes the current performance ceiling of RGB-to-polarization estimation, but also systematically reveals the respective strengths and limitations of different model families -- such as direct reconstruction versus generative synthesis, and task-specific training versus large-scale pre-training. In addition, we provide some potential directions for future research on polarization estimation. This benchmark is intended to serve as a foundational resource to facilitate the design and evaluation of future methods for polarization estimation from standard RGB inputs.

Abstract: Worldwide image geolocalization-the task of predicting GPS coordinates from images taken anywhere on Earth-poses a fundamental challenge due to the vast diversity in visual content across regions. While recent approaches adopt a two-stage pipeline of retrieving candidates and selecting the best match, they typically rely on simplistic similarity heuristics and point-wise supervision, failing to model spatial relationships among candidates. In this paper, we propose GeoRanker, a distance-aware ranking framework that leverages large vision-language models to jointly encode query-candidate interactions and predict geographic proximity. In addition, we introduce a multi-order distance loss that ranks both absolute and relative distances, enabling the model to reason over structured spatial relationships. To support this, we curate GeoRanking, the first dataset explicitly designed for geographic ranking tasks with multimodal candidate information. GeoRanker achieves state-of-the-art results on two well-established benchmarks (IM2GPS3K and YFCC4K), significantly outperforming current best methods.

Abstract: Acquiring detailed 3D scenes typically demands costly equipment, multi-view data, or labor-intensive modeling. Therefore, a lightweight alternative, generating complex 3D scenes from a single top-down image, plays an essential role in real-world applications. While recent 3D generative models have achieved remarkable results at the object level, their extension to full-scene generation often leads to inconsistent geometry, layout hallucinations, and low-quality meshes. In this work, we introduce SceneFuse-3D, a training-free framework designed to synthesize coherent 3D scenes from a single top-down view. Our method is grounded in two principles: region-based generation to improve image-to-3D alignment and resolution, and spatial-aware 3D inpainting to ensure global scene coherence and high-quality geometry generation. Specifically, we decompose the input image into overlapping regions and generate each using a pretrained 3D object generator, followed by a masked rectified flow inpainting process that fills in missing geometry while maintaining structural continuity. This modular design allows us to overcome resolution bottlenecks and preserve spatial structure without requiring 3D supervision or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across diverse scenes show that SceneFuse-3D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including Trellis, Hunyuan3D-2, TripoSG, and LGM, in terms of geometry quality, spatial coherence, and texture fidelity. Our results demonstrate that high-quality coherent 3D scene-level asset generation is achievable from a single top-down image using a principled, training-free pipeline.

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) is a widely adopted technique for encoding relative positional information in large language models (LLMs). However, when extended to vision-language models (VLMs), RoPE and its variants enforce relative positional dependencies separately within text and image tokens, introducing unintended cross-modal positional biases. For example, image tokens depicting semantically consistent content are assigned distinct positional encodings solely due to spatial location variations. As a result, such tokens exhibit entirely different relative positional relationships with their corresponding text tokens, ultimately leading to misaligned cross-modal representations. To address this, we propose Per-Token Distance, a simple yet effective metric for quantifying the independence of positional encodings across modalities. Informed by this analysis, we introduce Circle-RoPE, a novel encoding scheme designed to eliminate spurious cross-modal biases. Our key idea is to project image token indices onto a \emph{ring} that is orthogonal to the linear axis of text token indices, thereby forming a cone-like structure in the positional encoding space. In this configuration, each text token (point on the linear text axis) becomes the apex of a cone and maintains an equal distance to all image tokens (points on the circular image \emph{ring}), reducing artificial cross-modal biases while preserving intra-image spatial information. To further enhance performance, we propose a staggered strategy that applies different RoPE variants across layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively preserves spatial information from images while reducing relative positional bias, offering a more robust and flexible positional encoding framework for VLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/lose4578/CircleRoPE.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) aims to detect anomalies without any target domain training samples, relying solely on external auxiliary data. Existing CLIP-based methods attempt to activate the model's ZSAD potential via handcrafted or static learnable prompts. The former incur high engineering costs and limited semantic coverage, whereas the latter apply identical descriptions across diverse anomaly types, thus fail to adapt to complex variations. Furthermore, since CLIP is originally pretrained on large-scale classification tasks, its anomaly segmentation quality is highly sensitive to the exact wording of class names, severely constraining prompting strategies that depend on class labels. To address these challenges, we introduce ViP$^{2}$-CLIP. The key insight of ViP$^{2}$-CLIP is a Visual-Perception Prompting (ViP-Prompt) mechanism, which fuses global and multi-scale local visual context to adaptively generate fine-grained textual prompts, eliminating manual templates and class-name priors. This design enables our model to focus on precise abnormal regions, making it particularly valuable when category labels are ambiguous or privacy-constrained. Extensive experiments on 15 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that ViP$^{2}$-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance and robust cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis, yet current deep learning methods often demand extensive expert effort, i.e., either through annotating large training datasets or providing prompts at inference time for each new case. This paper introduces a zero-shot and automatic segmentation pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language and segmentation foundation models. Given a medical image and a task definition (e.g., "segment the optic disc in an eye fundus image"), our method uses a grounding model to generate an initial bounding box, followed by a visual prompt boosting module that enhance the prompts, which are then processed by a promptable segmentation model to produce the final mask. To address the challenges of domain gap and result verification, we introduce a test-time adaptation framework featuring a set of learnable adaptors that align the medical inputs with foundation model representations. Its hyperparameters are optimized via Bayesian Optimization, guided by a proxy validation model without requiring ground-truth labels. Our pipeline offers an annotation-efficient and scalable solution for zero-shot medical image segmentation across diverse tasks. Our pipeline is evaluated on seven diverse medical imaging datasets and shows promising results. By proper decomposition and test-time adaptation, our fully automatic pipeline not only substantially surpasses the previously best-performing method, yielding a 69\% relative improvement in accuracy (Dice Score from 42.53 to 71.81), but also performs competitively with weakly-prompted interactive foundation models.

Abstract: Synthetically augmenting training datasets with diffusion models has been an effective strategy for improving generalization of image classifiers. However, existing techniques struggle to ensure the diversity of generation and increase the size of the data by up to 10-30x to improve the in-distribution performance. In this work, we show that synthetically augmenting part of the data that is not learned early in training with faithful images-containing same features but different noise-outperforms augmenting the entire dataset. By analyzing a two-layer CNN, we prove that this strategy improves generalization by promoting homogeneity in feature learning speed without amplifying noise. Our extensive experiments show that by augmenting only 30%-40% of the data, our method boosts generalization by up to 2.8% in a variety of scenarios, including training ResNet, ViT, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer on CIFAR-10/100, and TinyImageNet, with various optimizers including SGD and SAM. Notably, our method applied with SGD outperforms the SOTA optimizer, SAM, on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet.

Abstract: Single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a cornerstone of structural biology, enabling near-atomic resolution analysis of macromolecules through advanced computational methods. However, the development of cryo-EM processing tools is constrained by the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets. Synthetic data generation offers a promising alternative, but existing approaches lack thorough biophysical modeling of heterogeneity and fail to reproduce the complex noise observed in real imaging. To address these limitations, we present CryoCCD, a synthesis framework that unifies versatile biophysical modeling with the first conditional cycle-consistent diffusion model tailored for cryo-EM. The biophysical engine provides multi-functional generation capabilities to capture authentic biological organization, and the diffusion model is enhanced with cycle consistency and mask-guided contrastive learning to ensure realistic noise while preserving structural fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CryoCCD generates structurally faithful micrographs, enhances particle picking and pose estimation, as well as achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines, while also generalizing effectively to held-out protein families.

<title>DS-VTON: An Enhanced Dual-Scale Coarse-to-Fine Framework for Virtual Try-On</title>

Abstract: Despite recent progress, most existing virtual try-on methods still struggle to simultaneously address two core challenges: accurately aligning the garment image with the target human body, and preserving fine-grained garment textures and patterns. These two requirements map directly onto a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm, where the coarse stage handles structural alignment and the fine stage recovers rich garment details. Motivated by this observation, we propose DS-VTON, an enhanced dual-scale coarse-to-fine framework that tackles the try-on problem more effectively. DS-VTON consists of two stages: the first stage generates a low-resolution try-on result to capture the semantic correspondence between garment and body, where reduced detail facilitates robust structural alignment. In the second stage, a blend-refine diffusion process reconstructs high-resolution outputs by refining the residual between scales through noise-image blending, emphasizing texture fidelity and effectively correcting fine-detail errors from the low-resolution stage. In addition, our method adopts a fully mask-free generation strategy, eliminating reliance on human parsing maps or segmentation masks. Extensive experiments show that DS-VTON not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but consistently and significantly surpasses prior methods in both structural alignment and texture fidelity across multiple standard virtual try-on benchmarks.

Abstract: Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) based on end-to-end autoregressive (AR) transformers effectively integrate both understanding and generation tasks within a single framework. However, intrinsic Task Objective Conflicts between high-level semantic abstraction in understanding and fine-grained detail preservation in generation pose significant challenges, often leading to suboptimal trade-offs and task interference. Existing solutions, such as decoupling shared visual encoders, fall short of fundamentally resolving these conflicts due to inherent AR architecture. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that decouples internal components of AR to resolve task objective conflicts. Specifically, we design UTAMoE, a Unified Task-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that decouples internal AR modules via a Task-Aware MoE Layer to create task-specific optimization subpaths. To enhance task differentiation while maintaining overall coordination, we introduce a novel Two-Stage Training Strategy. Extensive experiments on multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that UTAMoE mitigates task objective conflicts, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. Visualizations and ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: The advancement in large language models (LLMs) and large vision models has fueled the rapid progress in multi-modal vision-language reasoning capabilities. However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) remain challenged by compositional visual reasoning. This paper presents VLAgent, a neuro-symbolic approach to developing a Vision-Language Agent system for efficient compositional visual reasoning with three novel features. First, VLAgent develops an interpretable visualization-enhanced two-stage neuro-symbolic reasoning system. The first stage is managed by a front-end engine that generates a structured visual reasoning plan (symbolic program script) for each compositional visual reasoning task by utilizing a pre-trained LLM powered with few-shot chain-of-thought in-context learning. The second stage is managed by a high-performance back-end engine. It transforms the planning script into executable code based on visual input (image or video) and the combination of neural models and symbolic functions and then performs a sequence of actions for the compositional visual reason task. Second, to ensure and enhance the quality of mapping the logic plan to a sequence of executable instructions, VLAgent introduces the SS-parser, which examines the syntax and semantic correctness of the planning script, detects and repairs the logic errors found in the LLM-generated logic plan before generating the executable program. Third, VLAgent introduces the execution verifier in critical reasoning steps to validate and refine its compositional reasoning results in a stepwise manner, for example, ensemble methods for critical visual reasoning and caption analysis for low-confidence compositional reasoning. Extensive experiments on six visual benchmarks compared to a dozen SoTA visual reasoning models show that VLAgent outperforms existing representative approaches to compositional visual reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized video synthesis and editing. However, the scarcity of diverse, high-quality datasets continues to hinder video-conditioned robotic learning, limiting cross-platform generalization. In this work, we address the challenge of swapping a robotic arm in one video with another: a key step for crossembodiment learning. Unlike previous methods that depend on paired video demonstrations in the same environmental settings, our proposed framework, RoboSwap, operates on unpaired data from diverse environments, alleviating the data collection needs. RoboSwap introduces a novel video editing pipeline integrating both GANs and diffusion models, combining their isolated advantages. Specifically, we segment robotic arms from their backgrounds and train an unpaired GAN model to translate one robotic arm to another. The translated arm is blended with the original video background and refined with a diffusion model to enhance coherence, motion realism and object interaction. The GAN and diffusion stages are trained independently. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboSwap outperforms state-of-the-art video and image editing models on three benchmarks in terms of both structural coherence and motion consistency, thereby offering a robust solution for generating reliable, cross-embodiment data in robotic learning.

Abstract: To meet the growing demand for systematic surgical training, wet-lab environments have become indispensable platforms for hands-on practice in ophthalmology. Yet, traditional wet-lab training depends heavily on manual performance evaluations, which are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often subject to variability. Recent advances in computer vision offer promising avenues for automated skill assessment, enhancing both the efficiency and objectivity of surgical education. Despite notable progress in ophthalmic surgical datasets, existing resources predominantly focus on real surgeries or isolated tasks, falling short of supporting comprehensive skill evaluation in controlled wet-lab settings. To address these limitations, we introduce WetCat, the first dataset of wet-lab cataract surgery videos specifically curated for automated skill assessment. WetCat comprises high-resolution recordings of surgeries performed by trainees on artificial eyes, featuring comprehensive phase annotations and semantic segmentations of key anatomical structures. These annotations are meticulously designed to facilitate skill assessment during the critical capsulorhexis and phacoemulsification phases, adhering to standardized surgical skill assessment frameworks. By focusing on these essential phases, WetCat enables the development of interpretable, AI-driven evaluation tools aligned with established clinical metrics. This dataset lays a strong foundation for advancing objective, scalable surgical education and sets a new benchmark for automated workflow analysis and skill assessment in ophthalmology training. The dataset and annotations are publicly available in Synapse.

Abstract: As fine-tuning becomes increasingly impractical at scale, probing is emerging as the preferred evaluation protocol. Yet, the standard linear probing fails to adequately reflect the potential of models whose pre-training optimizes representations of patch tokens rather than an explicit global representation. This motivates the need for attentive probing, an alternative that uses attention to selectively aggregate patch-level features. Despite its growing adoption, attentive probing remains under-explored, with existing methods suffering from excessive parameterization and poor computational efficiency. In this work, we revisit attentive probing through the lens of the accuracy vs. parameter efficiency trade-off. We present the first comprehensive study of existing methods, analyzing their design choices and benchmarking their performance. Building on this, we propose efficient probing (EP), a simple yet effective multi-query cross-attention mechanism that eliminates redundant projections and reduces the number of trainable parameters. Despite its simplicity, EP outperforms linear probing and prior attentive probing approaches across seven benchmarks, generalizes well to diverse pre-training paradigms, and delivers strong low-shot and layer-wise gains. Beyond evaluation, our analysis uncovers emerging properties of EP, such as complementary attention maps, which open new directions for leveraging probing beyond protocol design.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have undergone rapid progress, largely attributed to reinforcement learning on complex reasoning tasks. In contrast, while spatial intelligence is fundamental for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world interaction, the systematic study of their complex spatial reasoning remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce SIRI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs' structural spatial intelligence through spatial-grounded reasoning tasks. SIRI-Bench comprises 9,000 video-question-answer triplets, where each problem is embedded in a realistic 3D scene. The benchmark is carefully designed so that solving each problem requires both spatial comprehension and structural reasoning. To facilitate large-scale data synthesis, we develop an Automatic Scene Creation Engine that employs collaborative LLM agents to translate abstract mathematical problems into faithful 3D scenes. Experimental results reveal that state-of-the-art VLMs struggle significantly on SIRI-Bench, underscoring the challenge of structural spatial reasoning. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to spatially grounded reasoning and advance VLMs in visual problem-solving.

Abstract: Cooking requires not only following instructions but also understanding, executing, and monitoring each step - a process that can be challenging without visual guidance. Although recipe images and videos offer helpful cues, they often lack consistency in focus, tools, and setup. To better support the cooking process, we introduce VisualChef, a method for generating contextual visual aids tailored to cooking scenarios. Given an initial frame and a specified action, VisualChef generates images depicting both the action's execution and the resulting appearance of the object, while preserving the initial frame's environment. Previous work aims to integrate knowledge extracted from large language models by generating detailed textual descriptions to guide image generation, which requires fine-grained visual-textual alignment and involves additional annotations. In contrast, VisualChef simplifies alignment through mask-based visual grounding. Our key insight is identifying action-relevant objects and classifying them to enable targeted modifications that reflect the intended action and outcome while maintaining a consistent environment. In addition, we propose an automated pipeline to extract high-quality initial, action, and final state frames. We evaluate VisualChef quantitatively and qualitatively on three egocentric video datasets and show its improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Universal photometric stereo (PS) is defined by two factors: it must (i) operate under arbitrary, unknown lighting conditions and (ii) avoid reliance on specific illumination models. Despite progress (e.g., SDM UniPS), two challenges remain. First, current encoders cannot guarantee that illumination and normal information are decoupled. To enforce decoupling, we introduce LINO UniPS with two key components: (i) Light Register Tokens with light alignment supervision to aggregate point, direction, and environment lights; (ii) Interleaved Attention Block featuring global cross-image attention that takes all lighting conditions together so the encoder can factor out lighting while retaining normal-related evidence. Second, high-frequency geometric details are easily lost. We address this with (i) a Wavelet-based Dual-branch Architecture and (ii) a Normal-gradient Perception Loss. These techniques yield a unified feature space in which lighting is explicitly represented by register tokens, while normal details are preserved via wavelet branch. We further introduce PS-Verse, a large-scale synthetic dataset graded by geometric complexity and lighting diversity, and adopt curriculum training from simple to complex scenes. Extensive experiments show new state-of-the-art results on public benchmarks (e.g., DiLiGenT, Luces), stronger generalization to real materials, and improved efficiency; ablations confirm that Light Register Tokens + Interleaved Attention Block drive better feature decoupling, while Wavelet-based Dual-branch Architecture + Normal-gradient Perception Loss recover finer details.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) has made significant strides by leveraging multimodal learning to align visual and textual modalities. However, current benchmarks overwhelmingly focus on questions answerable through explicit visual content - actions, objects, and events directly observable within individual frames or short clips. In contrast, creative and cinematic videos - such as movies, TV shows, and narrative-driven content - employ storytelling techniques that deliberately omit certain depictions, requiring viewers to infer motives, relationships across discontinuous frames with disjoint visual contexts. Humans naturally excel at such implicit reasoning, seamlessly integrating information across time and context to construct coherent narratives. Yet current benchmarks fail to capture this essential dimension of human-like understanding. To bridge this gap, we present ImplicitQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed to test VideoQA models on human-like implicit reasoning. ImplicitQA comprises 1K meticulously annotated QA pairs drawn from 1K high-quality creative video clips covering 15 genres across 7 decades of content. Questions are systematically categorized into nine key reasoning dimensions: lateral and vertical spatial reasoning, depth and proximity, viewpoint and visibility, motion and trajectory, causal and motivational reasoning, social interactions, physical context, and inferred counting. These annotations are deliberately challenging, crafted by authors, validated through multiple annotators, and benchmarked against human performance to ensure high quality. Our extensive evaluations on 11 leading VideoQA models reveals consistent and significant performance degradation, underscoring their reliance on surface-level visual cues and highlighting the difficulty of implicit reasoning. https://huggingface.co/datasets/ucf-crcv/ImplicitQA.

Abstract: Video super-resolution remains a major challenge in low-level vision tasks. To date, CNN- and Transformer-based methods have delivered impressive results. However, CNNs are limited by local receptive fields, while Transformers struggle with quadratic complexity, posing challenges for processing long sequences in VSR. Recently, Mamba has drawn attention for its long-sequence modeling, linear complexity, and large receptive fields. In this work, we propose VSRM, a novel \textbf{V}ideo \textbf{S}uper-\textbf{R}esolution framework that leverages the power of \textbf{M}amba. VSRM introduces Spatial-to-Temporal Mamba and Temporal-to-Spatial Mamba blocks to extract long-range spatio-temporal features and enhance receptive fields efficiently. To better align adjacent frames, we propose Deformable Cross-Mamba Alignment module. This module utilizes a deformable cross-mamba mechanism to make the compensation stage more dynamic and flexible, preventing feature distortions. Finally, we minimize the frequency domain gaps between reconstructed and ground-truth frames by proposing a simple yet effective Frequency Charbonnier-like loss that better preserves high-frequency content and enhances visual quality. Through extensive experiments, VSRM achieves state-of-the-art results on diverse benchmarks, establishing itself as a solid foundation for future research.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to meal images for nutrition analysis. However, existing work primarily evaluates proprietary models, such as GPT-4. This leaves the broad range of LLMs underexplored. Additionally, the influence of integrating contextual metadata and its interaction with various reasoning modifiers remains largely uncharted. This work investigates how interpreting contextual metadata derived from GPS coordinates (converted to location/venue type), timestamps (transformed into meal/day type), and the food items present can enhance LMM performance in estimating key nutritional values. These values include calories, macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, fat), and portion sizes. We also introduce \textbf{ACETADA}, a new food-image dataset slated for public release. This open dataset provides nutrition information verified by the dietitian and serves as the foundation for our analysis. Our evaluation across eight LMMs (four open-weight and four closed-weight) first establishes the benefit of contextual metadata integration over straightforward prompting with images alone. We then demonstrate how this incorporation of contextual information enhances the efficacy of reasoning modifiers, such as Chain-of-Thought, Multimodal Chain-of-Thought, Scale Hint, Few-Shot, and Expert Persona. Empirical results show that integrating metadata intelligently, when applied through straightforward prompting strategies, can significantly reduce the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in predicted nutritional values. This work highlights the potential of context-aware LMMs for improved nutrition analysis.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating realistic and versatile images from text prompts. Inspired by the recent advancements of language models, there is an increasing interest in further improving the models by aligning with human preferences. However, we investigate alignment from a divergence minimization perspective and reveal that existing preference optimization methods are typically trapped in suboptimal mean-seeking optimization. In this paper, we introduce Divergence Minimization Preference Optimization (DMPO), a novel and principled method for aligning diffusion models by minimizing reverse KL divergence, which asymptotically enjoys the same optimization direction as original RL. We provide rigorous analysis to justify the effectiveness of DMPO and conduct comprehensive experiments to validate its empirical strength across both human evaluations and automatic metrics. Our extensive results show that diffusion models fine-tuned with DMPO can consistently outperform or match existing techniques, specifically consistently outperforming all baseline models across different base models and test sets, achieving the best PickScore in every case, demonstrating the method's superiority in aligning generative behavior with desired outputs. Overall, DMPO unlocks a robust and elegant pathway for preference alignment, bridging principled theory with practical performance in diffusion models.

Abstract: We present SurfDist, a convolutional neural network architecture for three-dimensional volumetric instance segmentation. SurfDist enables prediction of instances represented as closed surfaces composed of smooth parametric surface patches, specifically bicubic B\'ezier triangles. SurfDist is a modification of the popular model architecture StarDist-3D which breaks StarDist-3D's coupling of instance parameterization dimension and instance voxel resolution, and it produces predictions which may be upsampled to arbitrarily high resolutions without introduction of voxelization artifacts.
  For datasets with blob-shaped instances, common in biomedical imaging, SurfDist can outperform StarDist-3D with more compact instance parameterizations. We detail SurfDist's technical implementation and show one synthetic and one real-world dataset for which it outperforms StarDist-3D. These results demonstrate that interpretable instance surface models can be learned effectively alongside instance membership.

Abstract: Real-world user-generated videos, especially on platforms like TikTok, often feature rich and intertwined audio visual content. However, existing video captioning benchmarks and models remain predominantly visual centric, overlooking the crucial role of audio in conveying scene dynamics, speaker intent, and narrative context. This lack of omni datasets and lightweight, capable models hampers progress in fine grained, multimodal video understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce UGC-VideoCap, a new benchmark and model framework specifically designed for detailed omnimodal captioning of short form user-generated videos. Unlike prior datasets, UGC-VideoCap emphasizes balanced integration of audio and visual modalities, featuring 1000 TikTok videos annotated through a structured three stage human-in-the-loop pipeline covering audio only, visual only, and joint audio visual semantics. The benchmark also includes 4000 carefully crafted QA pairs probing both unimodal and cross modal understanding. Alongside the dataset, we propose UGC-VideoCaptioner(3B), a 3B parameter captioning model distilled from Gemini 2.5 Flash. Using a novel two-stage training strategy supervised fine tuning followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), our approach enables efficient adaptation from limited data while maintaining competitive performance. Together, our benchmark and model offer a high-quality foundation and a data-efficient solution for advancing omnimodal video captioning in unconstrained real-world UGC settings.

Abstract: Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video remains a fundamental challenge, often hindered by information leakage and blurry reconstructions in existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches. We introduce DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.

Abstract: With the growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications, previously overlooked safety risks are becoming increasingly evident. In particular, seemingly innocuous multimodal inputs can combine to reveal harmful intent, leading to unsafe model outputs. While multimodal safety has received increasing attention, existing approaches often fail to address such latent risks, especially when harmfulness arises only from the interaction between modalities. We propose SIA (Safety via Intent Awareness), a training-free, intent-aware safety framework that proactively detects harmful intent in multimodal inputs and uses it to guide the generation of safe responses. SIA follows a three-stage process: (1) visual abstraction via captioning; (2) intent inference through few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting; and (3) intent-conditioned response generation. By dynamically adapting to the implicit intent inferred from an image-text pair, SIA mitigates harmful outputs without extensive retraining. Extensive experiments on safety benchmarks, including SIUO, MM-SafetyBench, and HoliSafe, show that SIA consistently improves safety and outperforms prior training-free methods.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-TEXT, a large-scale and high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To construct the SAR-TEXT dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks: image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA). Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT: SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 12.97% and 10.0% on the OSdataset_512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves significant improvements over the original CoCa models in terms of BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores. In the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that, as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets. All code, pretrained models, and the SAR-Text dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/YiguoHe/SAR-TEXT.

Abstract: Crowd evacuation simulation is critical for enhancing public safety, and demanded for realistic virtual environments. Current mainstream evacuation models overlook the complex human behaviors that occur during evacuation, such as pedestrian collisions, interpersonal interactions, and variations in behavior influenced by terrain types or individual body shapes. This results in the failure to accurately simulate the escape of people in the real world. In this paper, aligned with the sensory-decision-motor (SDM) flow of the human brain, we propose a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that integrates a 3D-adaptive SFM (Social Force Model) Decision Mechanism and a Personalized Gait Control Motor. This framework allows multiple agents to move in parallel and is suitable for various scenarios, with dynamic crowd awareness. Additionally, we introduce Part-level Force Visualization to assist in evacuation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework supports dynamic trajectory planning and personalized behavior for each agent throughout the evacuation process, and is compatible with uneven terrain. Visually, our method generates evacuation results that are more realistic and plausible, providing enhanced insights for crowd simulation. The code is available at http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/likun/projects/RESCUE.

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However, current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97% improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to the previous SOTA method RAG-T2M.

Abstract: While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120 new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape replacement.

<title>Deep Spectral Epipolar Representations for Dense Light Field Reconstruction</title>

Abstract: Accurate and efficient dense depth reconstruction from light field imagery remains a central challenge in computer vision, underpinning applications such as augmented reality, biomedical imaging, and 3D scene reconstruction. Existing deep convolutional approaches, while effective, often incur high computational overhead and are sensitive to noise and disparity inconsistencies in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel Deep Spectral Epipolar Representation (DSER) framework for dense light field reconstruction, which unifies deep spectral feature learning with epipolar-domain regularization. The proposed approach exploits frequency-domain correlations across epipolar plane images to enforce global structural coherence, thereby mitigating artifacts and enhancing depth accuracy. Unlike conventional supervised models, DSER operates efficiently with limited training data while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity. Comprehensive experiments on the 4D Light Field Benchmark and a diverse set of real-world datasets demonstrate that DSER achieves superior performance in terms of precision, structural consistency, and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the potential of integrating spectral priors with epipolar geometry for scalable and noise-resilient dense light field depth estimation, establishing DSER as a promising direction for next-generation high-dimensional vision systems.

Abstract: Robust fitting of geometric models is a fundamental task in many computer vision pipelines. Numerous innovations have been produced on the topic, from improving the efficiency and accuracy of random sampling heuristics to generating novel theoretical insights that underpin new approaches with mathematical guarantees. However, one aspect of robust fitting that has received little attention is energy efficiency. This performance metric has become critical as high energy consumption is a growing concern for AI adoption. In this paper, we explore energy-efficient robust fitting via the neuromorphic computing paradigm. Specifically, we designed a novel spiking neural network for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, the Intel Loihi 2. Enabling this are novel event-driven formulations of model estimation that allow robust fitting to be implemented in the unique architecture of Loihi 2, and algorithmic strategies to alleviate the current limited precision and instruction set of the hardware. Results show that our neuromorphic robust fitting consumes only a fraction (15%) of the energy required to run the established robust fitting algorithm on a standard CPU to equivalent accuracy.

Abstract: Autonomous driving platforms encounter diverse driving scenarios, each with varying hardware resources and precision requirements. Given the computational limitations of embedded devices, it is crucial to consider computing costs when deploying on target platforms like the NVIDIA\textsuperscript{\textregistered} DRIVE PX 2. Our objective is to customize the semantic segmentation network according to the computing power and specific scenarios of autonomous driving hardware. We implement dynamic adaptability through a three-tier control mechanism -- width multiplier, classifier depth, and classifier kernel -- allowing fine-grained control over model components based on hardware constraints and task requirements. This adaptability facilitates broad model scaling, targeted refinement of the final layers, and scenario-specific optimization of kernel sizes, leading to improved resource allocation and performance.
  Additionally, we leverage Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to efficiently explore hyperparameter spaces under tight computational budgets. Our approach addresses scenario-specific and task-specific requirements through automatic parameter search, accommodating the unique computational complexity and accuracy needs of autonomous driving. It scales its Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) for Task-Specific Learning Adaptation (TSLA), resulting in alternative configurations tailored to diverse self-driving tasks. These TSLA customizations maximize computational capacity and model accuracy, optimizing hardware utilization.

Abstract: Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding (image-to-text: I2T) and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened a new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also support broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus on the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T. Existing evaluation benchmarks consider these capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such as MME, MMBench for I2T. These isolated single-pass metrics do not reveal cross-consistency: whether a model that "understands" a concept can also "render" it, nor whether semantic meaning is preserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we introduce the Semantic Drift Protocol (SDP) for Unified Models, a cyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple generations to quantify semantic drift. We propose two metrics: (i) Mean Cumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic drift; and (ii) Multi-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending GenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO dataset, which is widely used in training; we create a new benchmark Nocaps+Docci400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and evaluated on seven recent models. SDP reveals substantial variation in cross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantic meaning over many alternations, whereas others like VILA-U drift quickly despite strong single-pass scores. Our results highlight SDP as a necessary complement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations. Code is available at https://github.com/mollahsabbir/Semantic-Drift-in-Unified-Models

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks (COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

Abstract: Understanding how people read city scenes can inform design and planning. We introduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban perception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs and photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community groups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical attributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to English. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt and deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard overlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and pairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible, objective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet) reaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items. Higher human agreement coincides with better model scores. Synthetic images slightly lower scores. We release the benchmark, prompts, and harness for reproducible, uncertainty-aware evaluation in participatory urban analysis.

Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles continue to heavily rely on AI systems, where transparency and security are critical for trust and operational safety. Post-hoc explanations provide transparency to these black-box like AI models but the quality and reliability of these explanations is often questioned due to inconsistencies and lack of faithfulness in representing model decisions. This paper systematically examines the impact of three widely used training approaches, namely natural training, adversarial training, and pruning, affect the quality of post-hoc explanations for traffic sign classifiers. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that pruning significantly enhances the comprehensibility and faithfulness of explanations (using saliency maps). Our findings reveal that pruning not only improves model efficiency but also enforces sparsity in learned representation, leading to more interpretable and reliable decisions. Additionally, these insights suggest that pruning is a promising strategy for developing transparent deep learning models, especially in resource-constrained vehicular AI systems.

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once) (v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families, consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of 1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in 2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support further research.

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset (9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest (ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG) across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns, excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3) \textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability. Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that (1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2) separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3) enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: As the popularity of deep learning (DL) in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) continues to rise, recent research has indicated that DL-based MRI reconstruction models might be excessively sensitive to minor input disturbances, including worst-case additive perturbations. This sensitivity often leads to unstable, aliased images. This raises the question of how to devise DL techniques for MRI reconstruction that can be robust to train-test variations. To address this problem, we propose a novel image reconstruction framework, termed Smoothed Unrolling (SMUG), which advances a deep unrolling-based MRI reconstruction model using a randomized smoothing (RS)-based robust learning approach. RS, which improves the tolerance of a model against input noises, has been widely used in the design of adversarial defense approaches for image classification tasks. Yet, we find that the conventional design that applies RS to the entire DL-based MRI model is ineffective. In this paper, we show that SMUG and its variants address the above issue by customizing the RS process based on the unrolling architecture of a DL-based MRI reconstruction model. Compared to the vanilla RS approach, we show that SMUG improves the robustness of MRI reconstruction with respect to a diverse set of instability sources, including worst-case and random noise perturbations to input measurements, varying measurement sampling rates, and different numbers of unrolling steps. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the robustness of our method in the presence of perturbations.

Abstract: We introduce RealKIE, a benchmark of five challenging datasets aimed at advancing key information extraction methods, with an emphasis on enterprise applications. The datasets include a diverse range of documents including SEC S1 Filings, US Non-disclosure Agreements, UK Charity Reports, FCC Invoices, and Resource Contracts. Each presents unique challenges: poor text serialization, sparse annotations in long documents, and complex tabular layouts. These datasets provide a realistic testing ground for key information extraction tasks like investment analysis and contract analysis. In addition to presenting these datasets, we offer an in-depth description of the annotation process, document processing techniques, and baseline modeling approaches. This contribution facilitates the development of NLP models capable of handling practical challenges and supports further research into information extraction technologies applicable to industry-specific problems.

<title>Temporal Source Recovery for Time-Series Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation</title>

Abstract: Time-Series (TS) data has grown in importance with the rise of Internet of Things devices like sensors, but its labeling remains costly and complex. While Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDAs) offers an effective solution, growing data privacy concerns have led to the development of Source-Free UDA (SFUDAs), enabling model adaptation to target domains without accessing source data. Despite their potential, applying existing SFUDAs to TS data is challenging due to the difficulty of transferring temporal dependencies, an essential characteristic of TS data, particularly in the absence of source samples. Although prior works attempt to address this by specific source pretraining designs, such requirements are often impractical, as source data owners cannot be expected to adhere to particular pretraining schemes. To address this, we propose Temporal Source Recovery (TemSR), a framework that leverages the intrinsic properties of TS data to generate a source-like domain and recover source temporal dependencies. With this domain, TemSR enables dependency transfer to the target domain without accessing source data or relying on source-specific designs, thereby facilitating effective and practical TS-SFUDA. TemSR features a masking recovery optimization process to generate a source-like distribution with restored temporal dependencies. This distribution is further refined through local context-aware regularization to preserve local dependencies, and anchor-based recovery diversity maximization to promote distributional diversity. Together, these components enable effective temporal dependency recovery and facilitate transfer across domains using standard UDA techniques. Extensive experiments across multiple TS tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TemSR, which even surpasses existing TS-SFUDA methods that require source-specific designs.

Abstract: Atrial Fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia worldwide, increasingly requires accurate bi-atrial structural assessment to guide ablation strategies, particularly in persistent AF. Late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) enables visualisation of atrial fibrosis, but precise manual segmentation remains time-consuming, operator-dependent, and prone to variability. We propose TASSNet, a novel two-stage deep learning framework for fully automated segmentation of both left atrium (LA) and right atrium (RA), including atrial walls and cavities, from 3D LGE-MRI. TASSNet introduces two main innovations: (i) a ResNeXt-based encoder to enhance feature extraction from limited medical datasets, and (ii) a cyclical learning rate schedule to address convergence instability in highly imbalanced, small-batch 3D segmentation tasks. We evaluated our method on two datasets, one of which was completely out-of-distribution, without any additional training. In both cases, TASSNet successfully segmented atrial structures with high accuracy. These results highlight TASSNet's potential for robust and reproducible bi-atrial segmentation, enabling advanced fibrosis quantification and personalised ablation planning in clinical AF management.

Abstract: Training manipulation policies for humanoid robots with diverse data enhances their robustness and generalization across tasks and platforms. However, learning solely from robot demonstrations is labor-intensive, requiring expensive tele-operated data collection which is difficult to scale. This paper investigates a more scalable data source, egocentric human demonstrations, to serve as cross-embodiment training data for robot learning. We mitigate the embodiment gap between humanoids and humans from both the data and modeling perspectives. We collect an egocentric task-oriented dataset (PH2D) that is directly aligned with humanoid manipulation demonstrations. We then train a human-humanoid behavior policy, which we term Human Action Transformer (HAT). The state-action space of HAT is unified for both humans and humanoid robots and can be differentiably retargeted to robot actions. Co-trained with smaller-scale robot data, HAT directly models humanoid robots and humans as different embodiments without additional supervision. We show that human data improves both generalization and robustness of HAT with significantly better data collection efficiency. Code and data: https://human-as-robot.github.io/

Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning framework and annotation methodology for the automatic detection of periodontal bone loss landmarks, associated conditions, and staging. 192 periapical radiographs were collected and annotated with a stage agnostic methodology, labelling clinically relevant landmarks regardless of disease presence or extent. We propose a heuristic post-processing module that aligns predicted keypoints to tooth boundaries using an auxiliary instance segmentation model. An evaluation metric, Percentage of Relative Correct Keypoints (PRCK), is proposed to capture keypoint performance in dental imaging domains. Four donor pose estimation models were adapted with fine-tuning for our keypoint problem. Post-processing improved fine-grained localisation, raising average PRCK^{0.05} by +0.028, but reduced coarse performance for PRCK^{0.25} by -0.0523 and PRCK^{0.5} by -0.0345. Orientation estimation shows excellent performance for auxiliary segmentation when filtered with either stage 1 object detection model. Periodontal staging was detected sufficiently, with the best mesial and distal Dice scores of 0.508 and 0.489, while furcation involvement and widened periodontal ligament space tasks remained challenging due to scarce positive samples. Scalability is implied with similar validation and external set performance. The annotation methodology enables stage agnostic training with balanced representation across disease severities for some detection tasks. The PRCK metric provides a domain-specific alternative to generic pose metrics, while the heuristic post-processing module consistently corrected implausible predictions with occasional catastrophic failures. The proposed framework demonstrates the feasibility of clinically interpretable periodontal bone loss assessment, with potential to reduce diagnostic variability and clinician workload.

Abstract: Vision Language Models exhibit impressive performance for various tasks, yet they often lack the sophisticated situational reasoning required for complex decision-making. This paper shows that VLMs can achieve surprisingly strong decision-making performance when visual scenes are replaced by textual descriptions, suggesting foundational reasoning can be effectively learned from language. Motivated by this insight, we propose Praxis-VLM, a reasoning VLM for vision-grounded decision-making. Praxis-VLM employs the GRPO algorithm on textual scenarios to instill robust reasoning capabilities, where models learn to evaluate actions and their consequences. These reasoning skills, acquired purely from text, successfully transfer to multimodal inference with visual inputs, significantly reducing reliance on scarce paired image-text training data. Experiments across diverse decision-making benchmarks demonstrate that Praxis-VLM substantially outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning, exhibiting superior performance and generalizability. Further analysis confirms that our models engage in explicit and effective reasoning, underpinning their enhanced performance and adaptability.

Abstract: This paper presents a Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter for multi-target filtering based on sensor measurements that are sets of trajectories in the last two-time step window. The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the paper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by deriving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables. The performance of the proposed filters are evaluated in a simulation study.

<title>What Lurks Within? Concept Auditing for Shared Diffusion Models at Scale</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of highly realistic and customized images from text prompts. With the rise of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, users can now customize powerful pre-trained models using minimal computational resources. However, the widespread sharing of fine-tuned DMs on open platforms raises growing ethical and legal concerns, as these models may inadvertently or deliberately generate sensitive or unauthorized content. Despite increasing regulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools for systematically auditing these models before deployment.
  In this paper, we address the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM has learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches typically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image classification but they suffer from critical limitations, including prompt uncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric concept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection, PAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for optimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled models trained with curated concept datasets and 771 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform. Evaluation results show that PAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by 18 - 40X compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first scalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of diffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more transparent diffusion model sharing.

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems, which require the simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives, are prevalent across numerous applications. Existing multi-objective optimization methods often rely on manually-tuned aggregation functions to formulate a joint optimization objective. The performance of such hand-tuned methods is heavily dependent on careful weight selection, a time-consuming and laborious process. These limitations also arise in the setting of reinforcement-learning-based motion tracking methods for physically simulated characters, where intricately crafted reward functions are typically used to achieve high-fidelity results. Such solutions not only require domain expertise and significant manual tuning, but also limit the applicability of the resulting reward function across diverse skills. To bridge this gap, we present a novel adversarial multi-objective optimization technique that is broadly applicable to a range of multi-objective reinforcement-learning tasks, including motion tracking. Our proposed Adversarial Differential Discriminator (ADD) receives a single positive sample, yet is still effective at guiding the optimization process. We demonstrate that our technique can enable characters to closely replicate a variety of acrobatic and agile behaviors, achieving comparable quality to state-of-the-art motion-tracking methods, without relying on manually-designed reward functions.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has shifted from static, data-driven models to dynamic systems capable of perceiving and interacting with real-world environments. Despite advancements in pattern recognition and symbolic reasoning, current AI systems, such as large language models, remain disembodied, unable to physically engage with the world. This limitation has driven the rise of embodied AI, where autonomous agents, such as humanoid robots, must navigate and manipulate unstructured environments with human-like adaptability. At the core of this challenge lies the concept of Neural Brain, a central intelligence system designed to drive embodied agents with human-like adaptability. A Neural Brain must seamlessly integrate multimodal sensing and perception with cognitive capabilities. Achieving this also requires an adaptive memory system and energy-efficient hardware-software co-design, enabling real-time action in dynamic environments. This paper introduces a unified framework for the Neural Brain of embodied agents, addressing two fundamental challenges: (1) defining the core components of Neural Brain and (2) bridging the gap between static AI models and the dynamic adaptability required for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose a biologically inspired architecture that integrates multimodal active sensing, perception-cognition-action function, neuroplasticity-based memory storage and updating, and neuromorphic hardware/software optimization. Furthermore, we also review the latest research on embodied agents across these four aspects and analyze the gap between current AI systems and human intelligence. By synthesizing insights from neuroscience, we outline a roadmap towards the development of generalizable, autonomous agents capable of human-level intelligence in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a key mechanism for harnessing the capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, its effectiveness remains highly sensitive to the quality of input ICL sequences, particularly for tasks involving complex reasoning or open-ended generation. A major limitation is our limited understanding of how LVLMs actually exploit these sequences during inference. To bridge this gap, we systematically interpret multimodal ICL through the lens of task mapping, which reveals how local and global relationships within and among demonstrations guide model reasoning. Building on this insight, we present TACO, a lightweight transformer-based model equipped with task-aware attention that dynamically configures ICL sequences. By injecting task-mapping signals into the autoregressive decoding process, TACO creates a bidirectional synergy between sequence construction and task reasoning. Experiments on five LVLMs and nine datasets demonstrate that TACO consistently surpasses baselines across diverse ICL tasks. These results position task mapping as a novel and valuable perspective for interpreting and improving multimodal ICL.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models achieve state-of-the-art sample quality, but require the expensive solution of a differential equation at inference time. Flow map models, commonly known as consistency models, encompass many recent efforts to improve inference-time efficiency by learning the solution operator of this differential equation. Yet despite their promise, these models lack a unified description that clearly explains how to learn them efficiently in practice. Here, building on the methodology proposed in Boffi et. al. (2024), we present a systematic algorithmic framework for directly learning the flow map associated with a flow or diffusion model. By exploiting a relationship between the velocity field underlying a continuous-time flow and the instantaneous rate of change of the flow map, we show how to convert any distillation scheme into a direct training algorithm via self-distillation, eliminating the need for pre-trained teachers. We introduce three algorithmic families based on different mathematical characterizations of the flow map: Eulerian, Lagrangian, and Progressive methods, which we show encompass and extend all known distillation and direct training schemes for consistency models. We find that the novel class of Lagrangian methods, which avoid both spatial derivatives and bootstrapping from small steps by design, achieve significantly more stable training and higher performance than more standard Eulerian and Progressive schemes. Our methodology unifies existing training schemes under a single common framework and reveals new design principles for accelerated generative modeling.

Abstract: Learning effective visuomotor policies for robotic manipulation is challenging, as it requires generating precise actions while maintaining computational efficiency. Existing methods remain unsatisfactory due to inherent limitations in the essential action representation and the basic network architectures. We observe that representing actions in the frequency domain captures the structured nature of motion more effectively: low-frequency components reflect global movement patterns, while high-frequency components encode fine local details. Additionally, robotic manipulation tasks of varying complexity demand different levels of modeling precision across these frequency bands. Motivated by this, we propose a novel paradigm for visuomotor policy learning that progressively models hierarchical frequency components. To further enhance precision, we introduce continuous latent representations that maintain smoothness and continuity in the action space. Extensive experiments across diverse 2D and 3D robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency, showcasing the potential of a frequency-domain autoregressive framework with continuous tokens for generalized robotic manipulation.Code is available at https://github.com/4DVLab/Freqpolicy

Abstract: Music-driven dance generation has garnered significant attention due to its wide range of industrial applications, particularly in the creation of group choreography. During the group dance generation process, however, most existing methods still face three primary issues: multi-dancer collisions, single-dancer foot sliding and abrupt swapping in the generation of long group dance. In this paper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to generate harmonious group dance. Specifically, to mitigate multi-dancer collisions, we utilize a dancer positioning embedding to encode temporal and identity information. Additionally, we incorporate a distance-consistency loss to ensure that inter-dancer distances remain within plausible ranges. To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we introduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design a Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For long group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling strategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional information into the noisy input. Furthermore, we integrate a Sequence Decoder layer to enhance the model's ability to selectively process long sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our TCDiff++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in long-duration scenarios, ensuring high-quality and coherent group dance generation.

Abstract: Long axial field-of-view PET scanners offer increased field-of-view and sensitivity compared to traditional PET scanners. However, a significant cost is associated with the densely packed photodetectors required for the extended-coverage systems, limiting clinical utilisation. To mitigate the cost limitations, alternative sparse system configurations have been proposed, allowing an extended field-of-view PET design with detector costs similar to a standard PET system, albeit at the expense of image quality. In this work, we propose a deep sinogram restoration network to fill in the missing sinogram data. Our method utilises a modified Residual U-Net, trained on clinical PET scans from a GE Signa PET/MR, simulating the removal of 50% of the detectors in a chessboard pattern (retaining only 25% of all lines of response). The model successfully recovers missing counts, with a mean absolute error below two events per pixel, outperforming 2D interpolation in both sinogram and reconstructed image domain. Notably, the predicted sinograms exhibit a smoothing effect, leading to reconstructed images lacking sharpness in finer details. Despite these limitations, the model demonstrates a substantial capacity for compensating for the undersampling caused by the sparse detector configuration. This proof-of-concept study suggests that sparse detector configurations, combined with deep learning techniques, offer a viable alternative to conventional PET scanner designs. This approach supports the development of cost-effective, total body PET scanners, allowing a significant step forward in medical imaging technology.

Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common autoimmune disease that has been the focus of research in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) and disease monitoring. In clinical settings, conventional radiography (CR) is widely used for the screening and evaluation of RA due to its low cost and accessibility. The wrist is a critical region for the diagnosis of RA. However, CAD research in this area remains limited, primarily due to the challenges in acquiring high-quality instance-level annotations. (i) The wrist comprises numerous small bones with narrow joint spaces, complex structures, and frequent overlaps, requiring detailed anatomical knowledge for accurate annotation. (ii) Disease progression in RA often leads to osteophyte, bone erosion (BE), and even bony ankylosis, which alter bone morphology and increase annotation difficulty, necessitating expertise in rheumatology. This work presents a multi-task dataset for wrist bone in CR, including two tasks: (i) wrist bone instance segmentation and (ii) Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) BE scoring, which is the first public resource for wrist bone instance segmentation. This dataset comprises 1048 wrist conventional radiographs of 388 patients from six medical centers, with pixel-level instance segmentation annotations for 618 images and SvdH BE scores for 800 images. This dataset can potentially support a wide range of research tasks related to RA, including joint space narrowing (JSN) progression quantification, BE detection, bone deformity evaluation, and osteophyte detection. It may also be applied to other wrist-related tasks, such as carpal bone fracture localization. We hope this dataset will significantly lower the barrier to research on wrist RA and accelerate progress in CAD research within the RA-related domain.

Abstract: Many real-world classification problems, such as plant identification, have extremely long-tailed class distributions. In order for prediction sets to be useful in such settings, they should (i) provide good class-conditional coverage, ensuring that rare classes are not systematically omitted from the prediction sets, and (ii) be a reasonable size, allowing users to easily verify candidate labels. Unfortunately, existing conformal prediction methods, when applied to the long-tailed setting, force practitioners to make a binary choice between small sets with poor class-conditional coverage or sets with very good class-conditional coverage but that are extremely large. We propose methods with guaranteed marginal coverage that smoothly trade off between set size and class-conditional coverage. First, we introduce a new conformal score function called prevalence-adjusted softmax that targets macro-coverage, a relaxed notion of class-conditional coverage. Second, we propose a new procedure that interpolates between marginal and class-conditional conformal prediction by linearly interpolating their conformal score thresholds. We demonstrate our methods on Pl@ntNet-300K and iNaturalist-2018, two long-tailed image datasets with 1,081 and 8,142 classes, respectively.

Abstract: While total intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC) volume is an established stroke biomarker, growing evidence shows this aggregate metric ignores the critical influence of plaque location, since calcification in different segments carries distinct prognostic and procedural risks. However, a finer-grained, segment-specific quantification has remained technically infeasible. Conventional 3D models are forced to process downsampled volumes or isolated patches, sacrificing the global context required to resolve anatomical ambiguity and render reliable landmark localization. To overcome this, we reformulate the 3D challenge as a \textbf{Parallel Probabilistic Landmark Localization} task along the 1D axial dimension. We propose the \textbf{Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST)}, a framework that processes full-resolution CT volumes as sequences of 2D slices, learning to predict $N=6$ independent probability distributions that pinpoint key anatomical landmarks. Our DST framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy and robustness. Evaluated on a 100-patient clinical cohort with rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, it achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of \textbf{0.1 slices}, with \textbf{96\%} of predictions falling within a $\pm1$ slice tolerance. Furthermore, to validate its architectural power, the DST backbone establishes the best result on the public Clean-CC-CCII classification benchmark under an end-to-end evaluation protocol. Our work delivers the first practical tool for automated segment-specific ICAC analysis. The proposed framework provides a foundation for further studies on the role of location-specific biomarkers in diagnosis, prognosis, and procedural planning.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have driven researchers to explore how well these models read data visualizations, e.g., bar charts, scatter plots. More recently, attention has shifted to visual question answering with maps (Map-VQA). However, Map-VQA research has primarily focused on choropleth maps, which cover only a limited range of thematic categories and visual analytical tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce MapIQ, a benchmark dataset comprising 14,706 question-answer pairs across three map types: choropleth maps, cartograms, and proportional symbol maps spanning topics from six distinct themes (e.g., housing, crime). We evaluate multiple MLLMs using six visual analytical tasks, comparing their performance against one another and a human baseline. An additional experiment examining the impact of map design changes (e.g., altered color schemes, modified legend designs, and removal of map elements) provides insights into the robustness and sensitivity of MLLMs, their reliance on internal geographic knowledge, and potential avenues for improving Map-VQA performance.

Abstract: Brain cancer affects millions worldwide, and in nearly every clinical setting, doctors rely on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to diagnose and monitor gliomas. However, the current standard for tumor quantification through manual segmentation of multi-parametric MRI is time-consuming, requires expert radiologists, and is often infeasible in under-resourced healthcare systems. This problem is especially pronounced in low-income regions, where MRI scanners are of lower quality and radiology expertise is scarce, leading to incorrect segmentation and quantification. In addition, the number of acquired MRI scans in Africa is typically small. To address these challenges, the BraTS-Lighthouse 2025 Challenge focuses on robust tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where resource constraints and image quality degradation introduce significant shifts. In this study, we present EMedNeXt -- an enhanced brain tumor segmentation framework based on MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision and optimized post-processing pipelines tailored for SSA. EMedNeXt introduces three key contributions: a larger region of interest, an improved nnU-Net v2-based architectural skeleton, and a robust model ensembling system. Evaluated on the hidden validation set, our solution achieved an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897 with an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at a tolerance of 0.5 mm and 1.0 mm, respectively.

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities, limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites; (3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-72B achieves an average success rate of 45.0% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models. Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open foundations for further CUA research.

Abstract: This paper presents Negative Shanshui, a real-time interactive AI synthesis approach that reinterprets classical Chinese landscape ink painting, i.e., shanshui, to engage with ecological crises in the Anthropocene. Negative Shanshui optimizes a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model for real-time inferences and integrates it with gaze-driven inpainting, frame interpolation; it enables dynamic morphing animations in response to the viewer's gaze and presents as an interactive virtual reality (VR) experience. The paper describes the complete technical pipeline, covering the system framework, optimization strategies, gaze-based interaction, and multimodal deployment in an art festival. Further analysis of audience feedback collected during its public exhibition highlights how participants variously engaged with the work through empathy, ambivalence, and critical reflection.

Abstract: Long video generation is fundamentally a long context memory problem: models must retain and retrieve salient events across a long range without collapsing or drifting. However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context videos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which makes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long sequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information retrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module, Mixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine. In MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory anchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that prevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the routing, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities, actions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct of retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and synthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches rely on access to large, representative datasets designed to capture the full spectrum of data quality encountered in practice, with both high- and low-quality data for training, benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features of the device state. Collating such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data availability, slow measurement bandwidths, and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to simulate charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling experiments. With an extensive set of parameters that can be varied and customizable noise models, QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development, benchmarking, and quantum device research.

<title>Interpreting deep learning-based stellar mass estimation via causal analysis and mutual information decomposition</title>

arXiv:2509.23901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: End-to-end deep learning models fed with multi-band galaxy images are powerful data-driven tools used to estimate galaxy physical properties in the absence of spectroscopy. However, due to a lack of interpretability and the associational nature of such models, it is difficult to understand how the information that is included in addition to integrated photometry (e.g., morphology) contributes to the estimation task. Improving our understanding in this field would enable further advances into unraveling the physical connections among galaxy properties and optimizing data exploitation. Therefore, our work is aimed at interpreting the deep learning-based estimation of stellar mass via two interpretability techniques: causal analysis and mutual information decomposition. The former reveals the causal paths between multiple variables beyond nondirectional statistical associations, while the latter quantifies the multicomponent contributions (i.e., redundant, unique, and synergistic) of different input data to the stellar mass estimation. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we obtained meaningful results that provide physical interpretations for image-based models. Our work demonstrates the gains from combining deep learning with interpretability techniques, and holds promise in promoting more data-driven astrophysical research (e.g., astrophysical parameter estimations and investigations on complex multivariate physical processes).

Summary:
The article introduces ExGS, a novel framework that combines Universal Gaussian Compression (UGC) with GaussPainter to achieve extreme compression of 3D Gaussian scenes for neural rendering. UGC performs re-optimization-free pruning to reduce Gaussian primitives, while GaussPainter uses diffusion priors and mask-guided refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned scenes. The framework includes a lightweight VAE and one-step diffusion design for real-time restoration. It can achieve over 100X compression while preserving fidelity and improving image quality.

Abstract: Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments. Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering quality.We introduce ExGS, a novel feed-forward framework that unifies Universal Gaussian Compression (UGC) with GaussPainter for Extreme 3DGS compression. UGC performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas GaussPainter leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in degraded renderings.To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can even achieve over 100X compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and high-quality neural rendering.Our code repository will be released at: https://github.com/chenttt2001/ExGS

Summary: 
The article introduces Causal-Adapter, a modular framework designed for counterfactual image generation by adapting frozen text-to-image diffusion backbones. It allows for causal interventions on target attributes, ensuring their effects are propagated to causal dependents while preserving the core image identity. Unlike previous methods that lack explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter utilizes structural causal modeling coupled with prompt-aligned injection and conditioned token contrastive loss strategies to regulate attributes effectively. The framework demonstrates superior performance on synthetic and real-world datasets, achieving significant MAE reduction on Pendulum and FID reduction on ADNI datasets. These results highlight the framework's ability to facilitate precise attribute control, high-fidelity image generation, and maintain strong image identity during counterfactual editing. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91% MAE reduction on Pendulum for accurate attribute control and 87% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust, generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and strong identity preservation.

Summary: 
Oracle-RLAIF introduces a novel framework for cost-effective fine-tuning of large video-language models (VLMs) by using an Oracle ranker instead of a trained reward model. This ranker ranks candidate model responses rather than scoring them, improving flexibility and efficiency. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, $GRPO_{rank}$, a rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), is introduced for optimizing ordinal feedback with rank-aware advantages. Empirical results show that Oracle-RLAIF consistently outperforms existing fine-tuning methods for VLMs on various video comprehension benchmarks. This framework provides a data-efficient approach to aligning large multi-modal video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective, recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF), which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create calibrated scalar rewards-- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce $GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.

Summary: 
PhysHMR introduces a unified framework for reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos by learning a visual-to-action policy in a physics-based simulator. The pixel-as-ray strategy is utilized to lift 2D keypoints into 3D spatial rays and provide global pose guidance for improved reconstruction accuracy. A distillation scheme transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the vision-conditioned policy, enhancing sample efficiency. The approach combines local visual features with global positioning to reason over detailed pose and overall positioning, achieving high-fidelity and physically realistic results. PhysHMR outperforms existing methods in both visual accuracy and physical realism, showcasing its effectiveness in diverse scenarios. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos remains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods primarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to unrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such artifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing following the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this two-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework that directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a physics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically grounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our approach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial rays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as policy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy 3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual features from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both detailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of reinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that transfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the vision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated reinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR produces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios, outperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.

Summary: 
The study explores the collaborative relationship between humans and face recognition algorithms in making consequential decisions. It establishes that the effectiveness of collaboration depends on the individual differences between people and machines, with the Proximal Accuracy Rule indicating that the benefits of collaboration increase as the difference in baseline accuracy decreases. The research identifies a critical fusion zone where fusing human and machine decisions improves system accuracy, demonstrating the importance of intelligent human-machine fusion. By selecting individuals with the potential to enhance machine performance, intelligent fusion proves to be more accurate than either humans or machines operating alone. The study offers a data-driven approach for utilizing AI in face identification, highlighting the significant role of both humans and machines in achieving accurate results. <div>
arXiv:2510.02570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human review of consequential decisions by face recognition algorithms creates a "collaborative" human-machine system. Individual differences between people and machines, however, affect whether collaboration improves or degrades accuracy in any given case. We establish the circumstances under which combining human and machine face identification decisions improves accuracy. Using data from expert and non-expert face identifiers, we examined the benefits of human-human and human-machine collaborations. The benefits of collaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between collaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule predicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline abilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using the PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate than the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was surprisingly large. We implemented "intelligent human-machine fusion" by selecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a high-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine operating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine judgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only partnerships was found by graph theory. This fully human system approximated the average performance achieved by intelligent human-machine collaboration. However, intelligent human-machine collaboration more effectively minimized the impact of low-performing humans on system-wide accuracy. The results demonstrate a meaningful role for both humans and machines in assuring accurate face identification. This study offers an evidence-based road map for the intelligent use of AI in face identification.

<div> Keywords: Generative video models, Uncertainty quantification, Calibration, Latent modeling, Benchmarking<br />
Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a framework for quantifying uncertainty in generative video models, addressing concerns about hallucinations and factual inaccuracies. The framework includes a metric for evaluating model calibration without strict assumptions, a black-box uncertainty quantification method called S-QUBED that decomposes uncertainty into aleatoric and epistemic components using latent modeling, and a dataset for benchmarking calibration. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, the framework distinguishes between uncertainty due to vague task specifications and lack of knowledge. Experimental results on benchmark video datasets show that S-QUBED provides calibrated total uncertainty estimates correlated with task accuracy and effectively identifies aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. <div>
arXiv:2510.02571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative video models demonstrate impressive text-to-video capabilities, spurring widespread adoption in many real-world applications. However, like large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate, producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns. To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.

Summary:
Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO) is a new method for enhancing the visual quality of images generated by pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. By optimizing the text embedding of a simple prompt, PEO aims to improve aesthetic fidelity, maintain adherence to the prompt, and minimize divergence from the original input. This approach is training-free and compatible with various backbone models. Through a tripartite objective function, PEO achieves impressive results in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, surpassing or matching the performance of existing text-to-image and prompt adaptation techniques. This innovative method demonstrates the potential for significant advancements in generating visually appealing images from textual prompts.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to aesthetic quality improvement in pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models when given a simple prompt. Our method, dubbed Prompt Embedding Optimization (PEO), leverages a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model as a backbone and optimizes the text embedding of a given simple and uncurated prompt to enhance the visual quality of the generated image. We achieve this by a tripartite objective function that improves the aesthetic fidelity of the generated image, ensures adherence to the optimized text embedding, and minimal divergence from the initial prompt. The latter is accomplished through a prompt preservation term. Additionally, PEO is training-free and backbone-independent. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, exceeding or equating the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image and prompt adaptation methods.

Abstract: Accurate 3D tracking of hands and their interactions with the world in unconstrained settings remains a significant challenge for egocentric computer vision. With few exceptions, existing datasets are predominantly captured in controlled lab setups, limiting environmental diversity and model generalization. To address this, we introduce a novel marker-less multi-camera system designed to capture precise 3D hands and objects, which allows for nearly unconstrained mobility in genuinely in-the-wild conditions. We combine a lightweight, back-mounted capture rig with eight exocentric cameras, and a user-worn Meta Quest 3 headset, which contributes two egocentric views. We design an ego-exo tracking pipeline to generate accurate 3D hand pose ground truth from this system, and rigorously evaluate its quality. By collecting an annotated dataset featuring synchronized multi-view images and precise 3D hand poses, we demonstrate the capability of our approach to significantly reduce the trade-off between environmental realism and 3D annotation accuracy.

<div> Keywords: diffusion models, video synthesis, real-time deployment, input-aware sparse attention, distillation loss 

Summary:
In this work, the authors address the issue of slow diffusion-based methods for synthesizing co-speech video from audio by distilling a many-step diffusion video model into a more efficient student model. They propose a new video distillation method that leverages input human pose conditioning for attention and loss functions. By using accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints, the method guides attention to relevant regions like the speaker's face and hands, reducing redundant computations and improving motion coherence. An input-aware distillation loss is introduced to enhance visual quality, particularly in lip synchronization and hand motion realism. By integrating input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss, the method achieves real-time performance without sacrificing visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithmic design choices. <div>

Abstract: Diffusion models can synthesize realistic co-speech video from audio for various applications, such as video creation and virtual agents. However, existing diffusion-based methods are slow due to numerous denoising steps and costly attention mechanisms, preventing real-time deployment. In this work, we distill a many-step diffusion video model into a few-step student model. Unfortunately, directly applying recent diffusion distillation methods degrades video quality and falls short of real-time performance. To address these issues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose conditioning for both attention and loss functions. We first propose using accurate correspondence between input human pose keypoints to guide attention to relevant regions, such as the speaker's face, hands, and upper body. This input-aware sparse attention reduces redundant computations and strengthens temporal correspondences of body parts, improving inference efficiency and motion coherence. To further enhance visual quality, we introduce an input-aware distillation loss that improves lip synchronization and hand motion realism. By integrating our input-aware sparse attention and distillation loss, our method achieves real-time performance with improved visual quality compared to recent audio-driven and input-driven methods. We also conduct extensive experiments showing the effectiveness of our algorithmic design choices.

<div> Keywords: deep generative models, continual adaptation, catastrophic forgetting, low rank adaptation, parameter-efficient fine-tuning <br />
Summary: <br />
Continual adaptation of deep generative models is crucial for their applications in text and vision tasks. Incremental training faces challenges due to catastrophic forgetting, which can be mitigated by retraining on synthetic data. However, this approach becomes impractical over time and leads to performance degradation. To address these issues, a novel conditioning mechanism called FunLoRA is proposed, using rank 1 matrices with increased functional rank. This allows the model to avoid catastrophic forgetting and only be trained on current task data. Experiment results using flow-matching models show that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method outperforms prior methods, achieving higher accuracy with reduced memory cost and sampling time. This approach paves the way for efficient and effective continual adaptation of generative models. <br /> 
Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continual adaptation of deep generative models holds tremendous potential and critical importance, given their rapid and expanding usage in text and vision based applications. Incremental training, however, remains highly challenging due to catastrophic forgetting phenomenon, which makes it difficult for neural networks to effectively incorporate new knowledge. A common strategy consists in retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to mitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the continually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii) reliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance degradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data. In this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more expressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank adaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose reparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected functions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA. Using this dynamic conditioning, the generative model is guaranteed to avoid catastrophic forgetting and needs only to be trained on data from the current task. Extensive experiments using flow-matching based models trained from scratch, showcase that our proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method surpasses prior state-of-the-art results based on diffusion models, reaching higher classification accuracy scores, while only requiring a fraction of the memory cost and sampling time.

<div> Recognition, Traffic light, Autonomous Vehicles, Adversarial Attacks, Robustness<br />
<br />
Summary: 
This study presents a new framework for traffic light and sign recognition in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in the USA. The framework addresses vulnerabilities to digital adversarial attacks and natural perturbations such as glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti. It incorporates temporal continuity, a multi-static field-of-view sensing approach, and robustness to various environmental conditions. The framework is based on a multi-source dataset from aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and Texas region videos, aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs). An anomaly detection system is implemented using a three-layer defense stack framework with feature squeezing, defensive distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection. Sequence-wise temporal voting further enhances the system's performance. Evaluation measures include accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity, and confidence stability. The Unified Defense Stack achieved 79.8mAP, reduced ASR to 18.2%, and minimized high-risk misclassifications to 32%. Physical transferability was confirmed through recapture probes. <div>

Abstract: Traffic light and sign recognition are key for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) because perception mistakes directly influence navigation and safety. In addition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing perturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous misclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal continuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both digital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV, sequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the USA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and self-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of RGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs): highway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life application of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer defense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive distillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise temporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included accuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity, and confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes for recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved 79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and BEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.

Abstract: Recent advancements in flow-matching have enabled high-quality text-to-image generation. However, the deterministic nature of flow-matching models makes them poorly suited for reinforcement learning, a key tool for improving image quality and human alignment. Prior work has introduced stochasticity by perturbing latents with random noise, but such perturbations are inefficient and unstable. We propose Smart-GRPO, the first method to optimize noise perturbations for reinforcement learning in flow-matching models. Smart-GRPO employs an iterative search strategy that decodes candidate perturbations, evaluates them with a reward function, and refines the noise distribution toward higher-reward regions. Experiments demonstrate that Smart-GRPO improves both reward optimization and visual quality compared to baseline methods. Our results suggest a practical path toward reinforcement learning in flow-matching frameworks, bridging the gap between efficient training and human-aligned generation.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become a leading reconstruction technique, known for its high-quality novel view synthesis and detailed reconstruction. However, most existing methods require dense, calibrated views. Reconstructing from free sparse images often leads to poor surface due to limited overlap and overfitting. We introduce FSFSplatter, a new approach for fast surface reconstruction from free sparse images. Our method integrates end-to-end dense Gaussian initialization, camera parameter estimation, and geometry-enhanced scene optimization. Specifically, FSFSplatter employs a large Transformer to encode multi-view images and generates a dense and geometrically consistent Gaussian scene initialization via a self-splitting Gaussian head. It eliminates local floaters through contribution-based pruning and mitigates overfitting to limited views by leveraging depth and multi-view feature supervision with differentiable camera parameters during rapid optimization. FSFSplatter outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on widely used DTU and Replica.

Summary:
MoGIC proposes a unified framework that integrates intention modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By optimizing both motion generation and intention prediction, it uncovers human goals and enhances generation with visual cues. A mixture-of-attention mechanism facilitates local alignment between tokens and motion. The Mo440H benchmark dataset is introduced to support this paradigm. After finetuning, MoGIC outperforms existing methods in reducing FID on benchmark datasets, motion captioning, and enabling intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing text-driven motion generation methods often treat synthesis as a bidirectional mapping between language and motion, but remain limited in capturing the causal logic of action execution and the human intentions that drive behavior. The absence of visual grounding further restricts precision and personalization, as language alone cannot specify fine-grained spatiotemporal details. We propose MoGIC, a unified framework that integrates intention modeling and visual priors into multimodal motion synthesis. By jointly optimizing multimodal-conditioned motion generation and intention prediction, MoGIC uncovers latent human goals, leverages visual priors to enhance generation, and exhibits versatile multimodal generative capability. We further introduce a mixture-of-attention mechanism with adaptive scope to enable effective local alignment between conditional tokens and motion subsequences. To support this paradigm, we curate Mo440H, a 440-hour benchmark from 21 high-quality motion datasets. Experiments show that after finetuning, MoGIC reduces FID by 38.6\% on HumanML3D and 34.6\% on Mo440H, surpasses LLM-based methods in motion captioning with a lightweight text head, and further enables intention prediction and vision-conditioned generation, advancing controllable motion synthesis and intention understanding.

Summary: 
Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos is challenging due to limited views and computational demands. Existing sparse control methods suffer from static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. A new motion-adaptive framework aligns control density with motion complexity, concentrating points in dynamic regions. Semantic and motion priors are leveraged to establish correspondences and apply motion-adaptive compression. Voxelization and motion tendency scoring enable flexible density adaptation.

Abstract: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from monocular videos remains difficult due to the ambiguity inferring 3D motion from limited views and computational demands of modeling temporally varying scenes. While recent sparse control methods alleviate computation by reducing millions of Gaussians to thousands of control points, they suffer from a critical limitation: they allocate points purely by geometry, leading to static redundancy and dynamic insufficiency. We propose a motion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity. Leveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we establish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive compression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing redundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible representational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion tendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control point allocation and motion complexity. To capture temporal evolution, we introduce spline-based trajectory parameterization initialized by 2D tracklets, replacing MLP-based deformation fields to achieve smoother motion representation and more stable optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in reconstruction quality and efficiency over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Summary: 
The paper introduces Net2Net, a novel approach for real-world noise removal that combines unsupervised learning with supervised pre-trained models. Traditional denoising methods often struggle with real-world noise complexity, while deep learning approaches may not generalize well across diverse noise types. Net2Net addresses these challenges by integrating an unsupervised DIP network to learn noise characteristics without labeled data, and a pre-trained DRUNet model for robust denoising leveraging large datasets. This hybrid framework improves generalization across noise patterns, particularly in scenarios with limited training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the superiority of Net2Net for real-world noise removal. <div>

Abstract: Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on handcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle to address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep learning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise characteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require extensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise types and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method, termed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained networks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation of Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised pre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained network adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without requiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned representations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising performance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise patterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited training data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method for real-world noise removal.

Summary: 
Retrv-R1 is introduced as a novel MLLM tailored for multimodal universal retrieval, incorporating step-by-step reasoning for improved performance. Challenges in applying RL methods to retrieval tasks are addressed through an information compression module and a new training paradigm. The information compression module reduces computational costs by preserving critical information for challenging candidates while the training paradigm includes a synthetic CoT dataset for optimization and a curriculum reward in RL training. These design enhancements lead to state-of-the-art performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization across various benchmarks and tasks. Through experiments, Retrv-R1 demonstrates superior results compared to existing models by achieving better accuracy in retrieval tasks with improved computational efficiency and stability. The combination of reasoning processes, efficient information preservation, and optimized training methodologies in Retrv-R1 showcases the potential of MLLMs in advancing the capabilities of multimodal retrieval systems.

arXiv:2510.02745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for multimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing step-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that directly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not feasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large token consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes, and (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to train for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an information compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while ensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved. Furthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage using a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective optimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both performance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1 achieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability, as demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces Bayesian Class Adaptation plus (BCA+), a training-free framework for Test-time adaptation (TTA) in vision-language models (VLMs) for object recognition and detection. BCA+ addresses performance degradation under real-world distribution shifts by incorporating adaptive priors derived from historical predictions into a dynamic cache. This cache-based prediction mechanism combines feature and scale similarity measurements with evolving class distribution priors. By formulating adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem and using uncertainty-guided fusion, BCA+ corrects both semantic understanding and contextual confidence of VLMs. BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on recognition and detection benchmarks efficiently without requiring backpropagation. <div>
arXiv:2510.02750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved remarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their performance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during inference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive backpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on likelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our prior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for object recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates adaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class Adaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both object recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that adaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection), and, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We formulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions are generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction. This cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood (measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving class distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with uncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic understanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method requiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition and detection benchmarks.

Summary: <br />
Accurate brain tumor classification is crucial for neuro-oncological surgery decisions. Current approaches have limitations in capturing new tumor types. This study presents Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification (HGCD-BT) that integrates hierarchical clustering and contrastive learning. HGCD-BT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in patch-level classification, particularly in identifying new tumor categories. The method's semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss enhances accuracy by 28%. Evaluation on the OpenSRH dataset shows improved performance, and the generalizability of HGCD-BT is confirmed on whole-slide images from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, showcasing its utility across various imaging modalities. This approach successfully bridges the gap between unsupervised learning and prior knowledge incorporation for better brain tumor classification.<br /><br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.02760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data. Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification (HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images, achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging modalities.

Summary: 
AdaRD-Key is a novel approach for enhancing long-form video understanding in vision-language models (VLMs). The method addresses the challenges of extensive temporal length and high information density in videos by proposing a query-driven keyframe sampling module. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified Relevance-Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining query-conditioned relevance and diversity components to select informative yet non-redundant frames. The approach is training-free, computationally efficient, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLMs. By utilizing a relevance-aware gating mechanism, AdaRD-Key is able to handle broad queries with weak alignment to the video, enhancing coverage without additional supervision. Experimental results on LongVideoBench and Video-MME datasets show that AdaRD-Key outperforms existing methods, particularly on long-form videos. The code for AdaRD-Key is available on GitHub for further exploration and implementation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.02778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for vision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high information density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely on uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to incorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches impose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window suppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at limiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near important events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect query relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module for query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified Relevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a query-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to yield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak alignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating mechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method seamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without additional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally efficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing VLMs in a plug-and-play manner.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet their cognitive processes remain opaque on complex lateral thinking challenges like rebus puzzles. While recent work has demonstrated these models struggle significantly with rebus puzzle solving, the underlying reasoning processes and failure patterns remain largely unexplored. We address this gap through a comprehensive explainability analysis that moves beyond performance metrics to understand how VLMs approach these complex lateral thinking challenges. Our study contributes a systematically annotated dataset of 221 rebus puzzles across six cognitive categories, paired with an evaluation framework that separates reasoning quality from answer correctness. We investigate three prompting strategies designed to elicit different types of explanatory processes and reveal critical insights into VLM cognitive processes. Our findings demonstrate that reasoning quality varies dramatically across puzzle categories, with models showing systematic strengths in visual composition while exhibiting fundamental limitations in absence interpretation and cultural symbolism. We also discover that prompting strategy substantially influences both cognitive approach and problem-solving effectiveness, establishing explainability as an integral component of model performance rather than a post-hoc consideration.

Summary: 
Text removal is a critical task in computer vision, with various applications such as privacy preservation and image editing. Existing research has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, but current datasets have limitations that hinder accurate evaluation and out-of-domain generalization. The SCUT-EnsText benchmark, for example, suffers from ground truth artifacts and overly simplistic text backgrounds. To address these issues, the authors introduce a new approach to synthesizing a text removal benchmark applicable to different domains. Their dataset includes text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and challenging scenarios for text removal tasks. The dataset is available online for use in further research and development.

Abstract: Text removal is a crucial task in computer vision with applications such as privacy preservation, image editing, and media reuse. While existing research has primarily focused on scene text removal in natural images, limitations in current datasets hinder out-of-domain generalization or accurate evaluation. In particular, widely used benchmarks such as SCUT-EnsText suffer from ground truth artifacts due to manual editing, overly simplistic text backgrounds, and evaluation metrics that do not capture the quality of generated results. To address these issues, we introduce an approach to synthesizing a text removal benchmark applicable to domains other than scene texts. Our dataset features text rendered on complex backgrounds using object-aware placement and vision-language model-generated content, ensuring clean ground truth and challenging text removal scenarios.

<div> alignment, medical object detection, representation alignment, modality context, DETR-style architectures

Summary:
The article addresses the challenge of mixed medical modalities affecting medical object detection by proposing a framework based on representation alignment. Modality tokens, lightweight embeddings derived from imaging modality information, are integrated into the detection process using Multimodality Context Attention (MoCA) to propagate modality context within object queries. A pretraining stage called QueryREPA aligns query representations to modality tokens using a contrastive objective. This approach enhances class-faithful queries that transfer effectively to downstream training. The proposed method improves average precision (AP) across diverse modalities without imposing significant overhead or requiring architectural modifications, making it a practical solution for robust multimodality medical object detection. The approach preserves DETR-style architectures, adds minimal latency, and effectively injects modality cues into object queries. The research offers a promising path towards enhancing medical object detection in heterogeneous medical datasets. 

Summary: <div>

Abstract: Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple, detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward robust multimodality medical object detection.

<div> Keywords: Large vision-language models, hallucinations, contrastive decoding, attention manipulation, MaskCD

Summary: <br /><br />Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in visual-language tasks but are prone to generating contradictory content known as hallucinations. Current approaches like contrastive decoding struggle with constructing appropriate contrastive samples, while attention manipulation lacks stability. This study introduces MaskCD, a method that utilizes LVLMs' "image heads" by masking them to create contrastive samples for decoding. Experimenting on LLaVA-1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-7b with benchmarks like CHAIR, POPE, AMBER, and MME, MaskCD effectively mitigates hallucinations without compromising the overall capabilities of LVLMs. The proposed approach provides a promising solution to address hallucination issues in large vision-language models. <div>

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue, such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach utilizes the "image heads" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding resources could be found at: https://github.com/Deng-Jingyuan/MaskCD .

Abstract: Pose estimation is still a challenge at the small scales. Few solutions exist to capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and microradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have proposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable performance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible using pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved using phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an open source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable pose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based local thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust to noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing are presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address different application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with synthetic and experimental images. Finally, guidelines are given for selecting the appropriate pattern design and microscope magnification lenses as a function of the desired performance.

Summary:<br />
This study focuses on improving cross-modal medical image synthesis by addressing three key challenges. The researchers propose a novel approach, Med-K2N, which treats multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with quality-driven selection mechanisms. The method involves learning adaptive weights for each modality-task pair and memorizing fusion patterns through progressive enhancement. Three collaborative modules, including PreWeightNet, ThresholdNet, EffiWeightNet, and the Causal Modality Identity Module (CMIM), are introduced to achieve effective fusion and maintain modality identity consistency. Experimental results show that Med-K2N outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmarks. The approach provides significant improvements in modeling the contributions of different modalities, ensuring fusion quality control, and maintaining modality consistency in multi-output generation. Source code for the proposed method is available for further exploration. <br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Cross-modal medical image synthesis research focuses on reconstructing missing imaging modalities from available ones to support clinical diagnosis. Driven by clinical necessities for flexible modality reconstruction, we explore K to N medical generation, where three critical challenges emerge: How can we model the heterogeneous contributions of different modalities to various target tasks? How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from noisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in multi-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing inspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive workflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal information, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with quality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to "learn" adaptive weights for each modality-task pair and "memorize" beneficial fusion patterns through progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative modules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for adaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation. Meanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal Modality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between generated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language modeling. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed Med-K2N outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on multiple benchmarks. Source code is available.

Abstract: Accurate, non-destructive assessment of egg quality is critical for ensuring food safety, maintaining product standards, and operational efficiency in commercial poultry production. This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed, with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152, DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction, SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in freshness prediction. All code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/Kenshin-Keeps/Egg_Quality_Prediction_ELMF4EggQ, promoting transparency, reproducibility, and further research in this domain.

<div> Framework; Zero-shot captioning; Patch-centric paradigm; Region-based captioning; Dense visual features 

Summary: 

The paper introduces Patch-ioner, a novel framework for zero-shot captioning that moves from an image-centric to a patch-centric approach. This shift allows for the captioning of arbitrary regions without requiring region-level supervision. Instead of utilizing global image representations, Patch-ioner treats individual patches as atomic captioning units and aggregates them to describe various regions, from single patches to non-contiguous areas and entire images. The study identifies that backbones generating meaningful, dense visual features, like DINO, are crucial for achieving top performance in region-based captioning tasks. Results indicate that Patch-ioner outperforms other baselines and state-of-the-art rivals in zero-shot dense, region-set, and novel trace captioning tasks. This underscores the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for scalable caption generation. The framework's project page can be accessed at https://paciosoft.com/Patch-ioner/. <div>

Abstract: Zero-shot captioners are recently proposed models that utilize common-space vision-language representations to caption images without relying on paired image-text data. To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a text-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global representations and whole-image captions. We present \frameworkName{}, a unified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to a patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without the need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image representations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and aggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to non-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that enable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework. Experiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual features, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple region-based captioning tasks. Compared to other baselines and state-of-the-art competitors, our models achieve better performance on zero-shot dense, region-set, and a newly introduced trace captioning task, highlighting the effectiveness of patch-wise semantic representations for scalable caption generation.

Summary:
The paper explores the ability of large vision foundation models like DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP to detect out-of-distribution (OoD) regions in semantic segmentation for applications like autonomous driving. A novel method is proposed that utilizes features from the InternImage backbone and K-Means clustering with confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters without any outlier supervision. This approach achieves impressive results on benchmarks such as RoadAnomaly and ADE-OoD, surpassing both supervised and unsupervised baselines. The findings indicate a promising direction for developing OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional data. <div>

Abstract: Detecting unknown objects in semantic segmentation is crucial for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Large vision foundation models, includ- ing DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced visual representation learn- ing by providing rich features that generalize well across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is established, their capability to detect out- of-distribution (OoD) regions in semantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate whether foundation models fine-tuned on segmen- tation datasets can inherently distinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier supervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features from the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside confidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our method achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77 on the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised and unsupervised baselines. These results suggest a promising direc- tion for generic OoD segmentation methods that require minimal assumptions or additional data.

<div> efficient inference, visual token pruning, multimodal large language models, holistic perspective, HoloV <br />
Summary:
The article discusses the challenges faced by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to their reliance on massive visual tokens, leading to significant computational overhead. Current token pruning methods often fail to maintain performance under high pruning ratios as they preserve semantically similar tokens. In response, the authors propose HoloV, a novel visual token pruning framework that takes a holistic approach to token retention. By distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops, HoloV ensures that retained tokens capture the global visual context rather than isolated features, preventing representational collapse. Experimental results show that HoloV outperforms state-of-the-art methods across tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios. For instance, LLaVA1.5 with HoloV maintains 95.8% performance after pruning 88.9% of visual tokens, showcasing superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on massive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate this problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or [\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this work, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning approaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting in pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we propose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first schemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By adaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops, HoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather than isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational collapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning. Experimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance across various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA methods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\% of the original performance after pruning 88.9\% of visual tokens, achieving superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs.

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In this work, we propose Confidence-Aware Weighting (CAW) to enhance zero-shot robustness in vision-language models. CAW consists of two components: (1) a Confidence-Aware loss that prioritizes uncertain adversarial examples by scaling the KL divergence between clean and adversarial predictions, and (2) a feature alignment regularization that preserves semantic consistency by minimizing the distance between frozen and fine-tuned image encoder features on adversarial inputs. These components work jointly to improve both clean and robust accuracy without sacrificing generalization. Extensive experiments on TinyImageNet and 14 additional datasets show that CAW outperforms recent methods such as PMG-AFT and TGA-ZSR under strong attacks like AutoAttack, while using less memory.

Abstract: Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major clinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging information in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians. This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic, laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed, comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy, while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction, underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and domain adaptation for clinical translation.

Abstract: Separating shared and independent features is crucial for multi-phase contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI synthesis. However, existing methods use deep autoencoder generators with low parameter efficiency and lack interpretable training strategies. In this paper, we propose Flip Distribution Alignment Variational Autoencoder (FDA-VAE), a lightweight feature-decoupled VAE model for multi-phase CE MRI synthesis. Our method encodes input and target images into two latent distributions that are symmetric concerning a standard normal distribution, effectively separating shared and independent features. The Y-shaped bidirectional training strategy further enhances the interpretability of feature separation. Experimental results show that compared to existing deep autoencoder-based end-to-end synthesis methods, FDA-VAE significantly reduces model parameters and inference time while effectively improving synthesis quality.

<div> Keywords: LPG-Bench, text-to-image generation, long prompts, TIT metric, multimodal models

Summary: 
The article introduces LPG-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation, with 200 detailed prompts and 2,600 generated images from 13 models. State-of-the-art models struggle with long prompts, leading to inconsistent image generation. To address this, a novel metric called TIT is proposed, focusing on text-to-image-to-text alignment by comparing the prompt with the generated image description. TIT-Score and TIT-Score-LLM show superior alignment with human judgment compared to existing metrics. The framework achieved a 7.31% improvement in accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT provide a comprehensive evaluation approach for text-to-image models. The resources will be publicly available.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large multimodal models (LMMs), recent text-to-image (T2I) models can generate high-quality images and demonstrate great alignment to short prompts. However, they still struggle to effectively understand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent generation. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench features 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250 words, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models. Using these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models and further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench, we observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor consistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To address the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on text-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating long-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I alignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the LMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient score-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based instantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to CLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute improvement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline. LPG-Bench and TIT methods together offer a deeper perspective to benchmark and foster the development of T2I models. All resources will be made publicly available.

Summary:
3D editing is a challenging task due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and fine-grained controllability. The new approach introduces 3DEditVerse, a large dataset for 3D editing, and 3DEditFormer, a 3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer model. 3DEditVerse consists of high-quality training pairs and curated test pairs to ensure edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic alignment. 3DEditFormer enhances image-to-3D generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, enabling precise and consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks.

Abstract: 3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D asset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are error-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of pose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits, 3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic alignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a 3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released. Project: https://www.lv-lab.org/3DEditFormer/

Summary:<br />
Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation relies on labeled satellite data, but cloud-free Sentinel-2 datasets limit effectiveness in tropical regions. A cloud injection algorithm was developed to simulate realistic cloud cover and assess the utility of Sentinel-1 radar data in filling gaps. A lightweight method incorporating Normalized Difference Indices in decoding layers improved spatial feature retention and segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset. Performance gains were observed across all models with the integration of Sentinel-1 data under cloud-covered conditions, showcasing the benefits of radar-optical fusion in challenging atmospheric scenarios. <div>

Abstract: Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on labeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are cloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are common. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud injection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test how Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed optical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral details during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we propose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs) into the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial features with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land cover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of 1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under cloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant performance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone, highlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging atmospheric scenarios.

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (RealSR) aims to enhance the visual quality of in-the-wild images, such as those captured by mobile phones. While existing methods leveraging large generative models demonstrate impressive results, the high computational cost and latency make them impractical for edge deployment. In this paper, we introduce PocketSR, an ultra-lightweight, single-step model that brings generative modeling capabilities to RealSR while maintaining high fidelity. To achieve this, we design LiteED, a highly efficient alternative to the original computationally intensive VAE in SD, reducing parameters by 97.5% while preserving high-quality encoding and decoding. Additionally, we propose online annealing pruning for the U-Net, which progressively shifts generative priors from heavy modules to lightweight counterparts, ensuring effective knowledge transfer and further optimizing efficiency. To mitigate the loss of prior knowledge during pruning, we incorporate a multi-layer feature distillation loss. Through an in-depth analysis of each design component, we provide valuable insights for future research. PocketSR, with a model size of 146M parameters, processes 4K images in just 0.8 seconds, achieving a remarkable speedup over previous methods. Notably, it delivers performance on par with state-of-the-art single-step and even multi-step RealSR models, making it a highly practical solution for edge-device applications.

Summary: 
In this study, the authors investigate the factors influencing compositional generalization in image and video generation. They focus on the impact of training objectives on discrete or continuous distributions and the role of conditioning in providing information about constituent concepts during training. By conducting controlled experiments, they identify two key factors that affect compositional generalization: 1) the training objective's distribution type, and 2) the level of conditioning providing information during training. The authors propose that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based objective can enhance compositional performance in discrete models like MaskGIT. Their findings highlight the importance of considering these factors in the design of generative models to improve compositional generalization. <div>

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to generate novel combinations of known concepts, is a key ingredient for visual generative models. Yet, not all mechanisms that enable or inhibit it are fully understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of how various design choices influence compositional generalization in image and video generation in a positive or negative way. Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i) whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like MaskGIT.

<div> latent space, diffusion models, image poisoning, unauthorized model adaptation, data privacy

Summary:
In this paper, a novel model-based perturbation strategy is proposed to address concerns related to data privacy and unauthorized usage in text-to-image diffusion models. The method operates in the latent space of diffusion models, ensuring high visual fidelity to original inputs while being resistant to inversion and personalization. By integrating unlearnability into Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), the approach offers a practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in imperceptibility and robustness, with gains in perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and FID, as well as increased resistance to inversion attacks. The method showcases its effectiveness in safeguarding sensitive data and highlights the potential for enhancing privacy and security in image generation models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in rapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few user images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead to concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and unauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication, the idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image poisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited imperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images with noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based perturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion models. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying the starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This trajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high visual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and personalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates unlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a practical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We validate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness against state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\sim 8 \% -10\%$ on perceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\sim 10\%$ on average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in safeguarding sensitive data.

<div> Keywords: semantic distillation, radiance fields, geometry-grounding, pose estimation, pretrained semantic features

Summary: 
Spatial-grounding in geometry-grounded backbones enhances the structural detail of image features. However, there is no significant improvement in semantic object localization with geometry-grounded features. In the task of radiance field inversion, a novel framework called SPINE is proposed, combining distilled semantics for coarse inversion and photometric-based optimization for fine inversion. Surprisingly, the accuracy of pose estimation decreases with geometry-grounded features. Visual-only features are found to be more versatile for a wider range of downstream tasks, while geometry-grounded features offer more geometric detail. The results underscore the need for further research on effective strategies for geometry-grounding to enhance the versatility and performance of pretrained semantic features. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in open-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded on pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and CLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit of geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In principle, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such as pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic features offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical questions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware semantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones contain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does geometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no significant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable higher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work and their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for inverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core components: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion using photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose estimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results suggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range of downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric detail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on effective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and performance of pretrained semantic features.

<div> Generative methods, Reference-driven image completion, GeoComplete, 3D structural guidance, Geometric consistency <br />
Summary: GeoComplete is a novel framework for reference-driven image completion that incorporates 3D structural guidance to ensure geometric consistency in completed regions. The framework utilizes conditioning on projected point clouds and target-aware masking to improve completion accuracy in challenging scenarios. By employing a dual-branch diffusion architecture, GeoComplete synthesizes missing regions from the target image while extracting geometric features from projected point clouds. The model also uses target-aware masking to focus on relevant reference cues and enhance performance. Experiment results show that GeoComplete outperforms existing methods, achieving a significant PSNR improvement of 17.1 while maintaining high visual quality. Overall, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for geometry-conditioned image completion. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.03110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target view using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view differs significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely solely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or depth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete, a novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce geometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior image-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the diffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information, and applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference cues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch synthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other extracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint self-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To address regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the target view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked during training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful cues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a geometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking strategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for geometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete achieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly boosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.

The Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC) framework generates disentangled video and audio captions to eliminate modal interference. The proposed BridgeDiT model utilizes a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism as a robust bridge for bidirectional information exchange, achieving semantic and temporal synchronization in T2SV generation.

Abstract: This study focuses on a challenging yet promising task, Text-to-Sounding-Video (T2SV) generation, which aims to generate a video with synchronized audio from text conditions, meanwhile ensuring both modalities are aligned with text. Despite progress in joint audio-video training, two critical challenges still remain unaddressed: (1) a single, shared text caption where the text for video is equal to the text for audio often creates modal interference, confusing the pretrained backbones, and (2) the optimal mechanism for cross-modal feature interaction remains unclear. To address these challenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC) framework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and an audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on HVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer, which employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust ``bridge" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information, achieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our contributions, offering key insights for the future T2SV task. All the codes and checkpoints will be publicly released.

Summary:
The article introduces the HAVIR model, which aims to improve the reconstruction of visual information from brain activity by leveraging hierarchical representation theory. The model consists of a Structural Generator and a Semantic Extractor that extract distinct features from different regions of the visual cortex. The Structural Generator focuses on spatial information, while the Semantic Extractor works on semantic processing. These components are integrated through the Versatile Diffusion model to generate high-quality image reconstructions. Experimental results show that HAVIR excels in capturing both structural and semantic aspects of complex visual stimuli, surpassing existing methods in performance. This interdisciplinary approach combining neuroscience and computer vision offers promising outcomes for visual information reconstruction. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.03122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision. However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.

arXiv:2510.03135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating interaction-centric videos, such as those depicting humans or robots interacting with objects, is crucial for embodied intelligence, as they provide rich and diverse visual priors for robot learning, manipulation policy training, and affordance reasoning. However, existing methods often struggle to model such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that masks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality, obtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for real-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel framework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It adopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion trajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on these trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from users while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process. Furthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users to specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory through action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic training and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and object categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual realism and controllability compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Accurately modeling human mobility is critical for urban planning, epidemiology, and traffic management. In this work, we introduce Markovian Reeb Graphs, a novel framework for simulating spatiotemporal trajectories that preserve Patterns of Life (PoLs) learned from baseline data. By combining individual- and population-level mobility structures within a probabilistic topological model, our approach generates realistic future trajectories that capture both consistency and variability in daily life. Evaluations on the Urban Anomalies dataset (Atlanta and Berlin subsets) using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) across population- and agent-level metrics demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong fidelity while remaining data- and compute-efficient. These results position Markovian Reeb Graphs as a scalable framework for trajectory simulation with broad applicability across diverse urban environments.

<div> Keywords: Spine disorders, AI-assisted diagnosis, SpineMed-450k, spine-specific benchmarks, LVLMs

Summary:
Spine disorders impact 619 million individuals globally, leading to disability, yet AI-based diagnosis is hindered by the lack of adequate datasets. To address this, the SpineMed ecosystem was created in collaboration with spine surgeons, offering SpineMed-450k, a dataset for vertebral-level reasoning across different imaging modalities, and SpineBench, an evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k comprises over 450,000 instruction instances curated from various sources and ensured high quality via a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline. Evaluating advanced large vision-language models (LVLMs) on SpineBench revealed deficiencies in level-specific reasoning, whereas a model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k displayed notable enhancements across tasks. Clinician feedback confirmed the model's diagnostic clarity and practicality. This initiative demonstrates a significant advancement in AI-assisted diagnosis for spine disorders, improving clinical decision-making and patient outcomes.

arXiv:2510.03160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized, spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets, and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations, and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes, including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning. Our comprehensive evaluation of several recently advanced large vision-language models (LVLMs) on SpineBench reveals systematic weaknesses in fine-grained, level-specific reasoning. In contrast, our model fine-tuned on SpineMed-450k demonstrates consistent and significant improvements across all tasks. Clinician assessments confirm the diagnostic clarity and practical utility of our model's outputs.

Abstract: With the rapid advancements in image generation, synthetic images have become increasingly realistic, posing significant societal risks, such as misinformation and fraud. Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield, the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel approach called ROGR for reconstructing a relightable 3D model of an object captured from multiple views. This approach is driven by a generative relighting model that simulates placing the object under different environmental illuminations. ROGR samples the object's appearance under various lighting conditions to create a dataset used to train a lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). The NeRF utilizes a dual-branch architecture to encode general lighting effects and specularities separately, enabling efficient feed-forward relighting under any input environmental lighting. Evaluation on TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets shows improvement over state-of-the-art methods, and real-world object captures demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach. <div>

Abstract: We introduce ROGR, a novel approach that reconstructs a relightable 3D model of an object captured from multiple views, driven by a generative relighting model that simulates the effects of placing the object under novel environment illuminations. Our method samples the appearance of the object under multiple lighting environments, creating a dataset that is used to train a lighting-conditioned Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) that outputs the object's appearance under any input environmental lighting. The lighting-conditioned NeRF uses a novel dual-branch architecture to encode the general lighting effects and specularities separately. The optimized lighting-conditioned NeRF enables efficient feed-forward relighting under arbitrary environment maps without requiring per-illumination optimization or light transport simulation. We evaluate our approach on the established TensoIR and Stanford-ORB datasets, where it improves upon the state-of-the-art on most metrics, and showcase our approach on real-world object captures.

<title>Product-Quantised Image Representation for High-Quality Image Synthesis</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.03191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Product quantisation (PQ) is a classical method for scalable vector encoding, yet it has seen limited usage for latent representations in high-fidelity image generation. In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.

arXiv:2510.03198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models have proved effective for world modeling and interactive scene generation, with Minecraft gameplay as a representative application. To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate natural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency when revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must compress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which exposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency, whereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene generation quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context. We present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols with a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct gameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during exploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward Training extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained predictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial memory for maintaining consistency. Point-to-Frame Retrieval efficiently retrieves history by mapping currently visible points to their source frames, while Incremental 3D Reconstruction maintains and updates an explicit 3D cache. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Memory Forcing achieves superior long-term spatial consistency and generative quality across diverse environments, while maintaining computational efficiency for extended sequences.

Abstract: Intention drives human movement in complex environments, but such movement can only happen if the surrounding context supports it. Despite the intuitive nature of this mechanism, existing research has not yet provided tools to evaluate the alignment between skeletal movement (motion), intention (text), and the surrounding context (scene). In this work, we introduce MonSTeR, the first MOtioN-Scene-TExt Retrieval model. Inspired by the modeling of higher-order relations, MonSTeR constructs a unified latent space by leveraging unimodal and cross-modal representations. This allows MonSTeR to capture the intricate dependencies between modalities, enabling flexible but robust retrieval across various tasks. Our results show that MonSTeR outperforms trimodal models that rely solely on unimodal representations. Furthermore, we validate the alignment of our retrieval scores with human preferences through a dedicated user study. We demonstrate the versatility of MonSTeR's latent space on zero-shot in-Scene Object Placement and Motion Captioning. Code and pre-trained models are available at github.com/colloroneluca/MonSTeR.

<title>Test-Time Defense Against Adversarial Attacks via Stochastic Resonance of Latent Ensembles</title>

Abstract: We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks: imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing, which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free, architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time, establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9% on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently achieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining the advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches. However, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving cross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to the overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a novel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its core, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a dual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel relationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for building rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the interesting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture benchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges. The source code will be available upon publication.

arXiv:2510.03230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training. Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally, addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across diverse resolutions and platforms.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on general visual benchmarks but struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks in specialized domains such as medical imaging, where labeled data is limited and expensive. We introduce LEAML, a label-efficient adaptation framework that leverages both scarce labeled VQA samples and abundant unlabeled images. Our approach generates domain-relevant pseudo question-answer pairs for unlabeled data using a QA generator regularized by caption distillation. Importantly, we selectively update only those neurons most relevant to question-answering, enabling the QA Generator to efficiently acquire domain-specific knowledge during distillation. Experiments on gastrointestinal endoscopy and sports VQA demonstrate that LEAML consistently outperforms standard fine-tuning under minimal supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed LEAML framework.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) has facilitated the effortless creation of high-quality images, while simultaneously raising critical concerns regarding intellectual property protection, authenticity, and accountability. Watermarking has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges by distinguishing AI-generated images from natural content, ensuring provenance, and fostering trustworthy digital ecosystems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the current state of AI-generated image watermarking, addressing five key dimensions: (1) formalization of image watermarking systems; (2) an overview and comparison of diverse watermarking techniques; (3) evaluation methodologies with respect to visual quality, capacity, and detectability; (4) vulnerabilities to malicious attacks; and (5) prevailing challenges and future directions. The survey aims to equip researchers with a holistic understanding of AI-generated image watermarking technologies, thereby promoting their continued development.

Abstract: Objective: To develop an explainable multimodal large language model (MM-LLM) that (1) screens optic nerve head (ONH) OCT circle scans for quality and (2) generates structured clinical reports that include glaucoma diagnosis and sector-wise retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning assessments. Design: Retrospective cohort study of 1,310 subjects contributing 43,849 Spectralis ONH OCT circle scans (1,331 glaucomatous and 867 healthy eyes) from the DIGS and ADAGES cohorts. Methods: A MM-LLM (Llama 3.2 Vision-Instruct model) was fine-tuned to generate clinical descriptions of OCT imaging data. Training data included paired OCT images and automatically generated, structured clinical reports that described global and sectoral RNFL thinning. Poor-quality scans were labeled as unusable and paired with a fixed refusal statement. The model was evaluated on a held-out test set for three tasks: quality assessment, glaucoma detection, and RNFL thinning classification across seven anatomical sectors. Evaluation metrics included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. Model description quality was also evaluated using standard text evaluation metrics. Results: The model achieved 0.90 accuracy and 0.98 specificity for quality triage. For glaucoma detection, accuracy was 0.86 (sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.73, F1-score 0.91). RNFL thinning prediction accuracy ranged from 0.83 to 0.94, with highest performance in global and temporal sectors. Text generation scores showed strong alignment with reference reports (BLEU: 0.82; ROUGE-1: 0.94; ROUGE-2: 0.87; ROUGE-L: 0.92; BERTScore-F1: 0.99). Conclusions: The fine-tuned MM-LLM generated accurate clinical descriptions based on OCT imaging. The model achieved high accuracy in identifying image quality issues and detecting glaucoma. The model also provided sectoral descriptions of RNFL thinning to help support clinical OCT evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained purely on text ostensibly lack any direct perceptual experience, yet their internal representations are implicitly shaped by multimodal regularities encoded in language. We test the hypothesis that explicit sensory prompting can surface this latent structure, bringing a text-only LLM into closer representational alignment with specialist vision and audio encoders. When a sensory prompt tells the model to 'see' or 'hear', it cues the model to resolve its next-token predictions as if they were conditioned on latent visual or auditory evidence that is never actually supplied. Our findings reveal that lightweight prompt engineering can reliably activate modality-appropriate representations in purely text-trained LLMs.

Abstract: Driving scene manipulation with sensor data is emerging as a promising alternative to traditional virtual driving simulators. However, existing frameworks struggle to generate realistic scenarios efficiently due to limited editing capabilities. To address these challenges, we present SIMSplat, a predictive driving scene editor with language-aligned Gaussian splatting. As a language-controlled editor, SIMSplat enables intuitive manipulation using natural language prompts. By aligning language with Gaussian-reconstructed scenes, it further supports direct querying of road objects, allowing precise and flexible editing. Our method provides detailed object-level editing, including adding new objects and modifying the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians, while also incorporating predictive path refinement through multi-agent motion prediction to generate realistic interactions among all agents in the scene. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate SIMSplat's extensive editing capabilities and adaptability across a wide range of scenarios. Project page: https://sungyeonparkk.github.io/simsplat/

<title>Learning a distance measure from the information-estimation geometry of data</title>

Abstract: We introduce the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel form of distance function derived from an underlying continuous probability density over a domain of signals. The IEM is rooted in a fundamental relationship between information theory and estimation theory, which links the log-probability of a signal with the errors of an optimal denoiser, applied to noisy observations of the signal. In particular, the IEM between a pair of signals is obtained by comparing their denoising error vectors over a range of noise amplitudes. Geometrically, this amounts to comparing the score vector fields of the blurred density around the signals over a range of blur levels. We prove that the IEM is a valid global metric and derive a closed-form expression for its local second-order approximation, which yields a Riemannian metric. For Gaussian-distributed signals, the IEM coincides with the Mahalanobis distance. But for more complex distributions, it adapts, both locally and globally, to the geometry of the distribution. In practice, the IEM can be computed using a learned denoiser (analogous to generative diffusion models) and solving a one-dimensional integral. To demonstrate the value of our framework, we learn an IEM on the ImageNet database. Experiments show that this IEM is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image quality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel benchmark dataset of Visible and Near-Infrared (VNIR) hyperspectral imagery acquired via an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platform for landmine and unexploded ordnance (UXO) detection research. The dataset was collected over a controlled test field seeded with 143 realistic surrogate landmine and UXO targets, including surface, partially buried, and fully buried configurations. Data acquisition was performed using a Headwall Nano-Hyperspec sensor mounted on a multi-sensor drone platform, flown at an altitude of approximately 20.6 m, capturing 270 contiguous spectral bands spanning 398-1002 nm. Radiometric calibration, orthorectification, and mosaicking were performed followed by reflectance retrieval using a two-point Empirical Line Method (ELM), with reference spectra acquired using an SVC spectroradiometer. Cross-validation against six reference objects yielded RMSE values below 1.0 and SAM values between 1 and 6 degrees in the 400-900 nm range, demonstrating high spectral fidelity. The dataset is released alongside raw radiance cubes, GCP/AeroPoint data, and reference spectra to support reproducible research. This contribution fills a critical gap in open-access UAV-based hyperspectral data for landmine detection and offers a multi-sensor benchmark when combined with previously published drone-based electromagnetic induction (EMI) data from the same test field.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks present a significant threat to modern machine learning systems. Yet, existing detection methods often lack the ability to detect unseen attacks or detect different attack types with a high level of accuracy. In this work, we propose a statistical approach that establishes a detection baseline before a neural network's deployment, enabling effective real-time adversarial detection. We generate a metric of adversarial presence by comparing the behavior of a compressed/uncompressed neural network pair. Our method has been tested against state-of-the-art techniques, and it achieves near-perfect detection across a wide range of attack types. Moreover, it significantly reduces false positives, making it both reliable and practical for real-world applications.

<title>Image Enhancement Based on Pigment Representation</title>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel and efficient image enhancement method based on pigment representation. Unlike conventional methods where the color transformation is restricted to pre-defined color spaces like RGB, our method dynamically adapts to input content by transforming RGB colors into a high-dimensional feature space referred to as \textit{pigments}. The proposed pigment representation offers adaptability and expressiveness, achieving superior image enhancement performance. The proposed method involves transforming input RGB colors into high-dimensional pigments, which are then reprojected individually and blended to refine and aggregate the information of the colors in pigment spaces. Those pigments are then transformed back into RGB colors to generate an enhanced output image. The transformation and reprojection parameters are derived from the visual encoder which adaptively estimates such parameters based on the content in the input image. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods in image enhancement tasks, including image retouching and tone mapping, while maintaining relatively low computational complexity and small model size.

Abstract: Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law, which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates, founded on geometric Brownian motion.

<title>GCVAMD: A Modified CausalVAE Model for Causal Age-related Macular Degeneration Risk Factor Detection and Prediction</title>

Abstract: Age Related Macular Degeneration(AMD) has been one of the most leading causes of permanent vision impairment in ophthalmology. Though treatments, such as anti VEGF drugs or photodynamic therapies, were developed to slow down the degenerative process of AMD, there is still no specific cure to reverse vision loss caused by AMD. Thus, for AMD, detecting existence of risk factors of AMD or AMD itself within the patient retina in early stages is a crucial task to reduce the possibility of vision impairment. Apart from traditional approaches, deep learning based methods, especially attention mechanism based CNNs and GradCAM based XAI analysis on OCT scans, exhibited successful performance in distinguishing AMD retina from normal retinas, making it possible to use AI driven models to aid medical diagnosis and analysis by ophthalmologists regarding AMD. However, though having significant success, previous works mostly focused on prediction performance itself, not pathologies or underlying causal mechanisms of AMD, which can prohibit intervention analysis on specific factors or even lead to less reliable decisions. Thus, this paper introduces a novel causal AMD analysis model: GCVAMD, which incorporates a modified CausalVAE approach that can extract latent causal factors from only raw OCT images. By considering causality in AMD detection, GCVAMD enables causal inference such as treatment simulation or intervention analysis regarding major risk factors: drusen and neovascularization, while returning informative latent causal features that can enhance downstream tasks. Results show that through GCVAMD, drusen status and neovascularization status can be identified with AMD causal mechanisms in GCVAMD latent spaces, which can in turn be used for various tasks from AMD detection(classification) to intervention analysis.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning capabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several automobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging environments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct the \textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation. Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a reduction of around $3\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning ($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of REACT-Drive.

Abstract: What does it mean for a machine to recognize beauty? While beauty remains a culturally and experientially compelling but philosophically elusive concept, deep learning systems increasingly appear capable of modeling aesthetic judgment. In this paper, we explore the capacity of neural networks to represent beauty despite the immense formal diversity of objects for which the term applies. By drawing on recent work on cross-model representational convergence, we show how aesthetic content produces more similar and aligned representations between models which have been trained on distinct data and modalities - while unaesthetic images do not produce more aligned representations. This finding implies that the formal structure of beautiful images has a realist basis - rather than only as a reflection of socially constructed values. Furthermore, we propose that these realist representations exist because of a joint grounding of aesthetic form in physical and cultural substance. We argue that human perceptual and creative acts play a central role in shaping these the latent spaces of deep learning systems, but that a realist basis for aesthetics shows that machines are not mere creative parrots but can produce novel creative insights from the unique vantage point of scale. Our findings suggest that human-machine co-creation is not merely possible, but foundational - with beauty serving as a teleological attractor in both cultural production and machine perception.

Abstract: Assessing model generalization under distribution shift is essential for real-world deployment, particularly when labeled test data is unavailable. This paper presents a unified and practical framework for unsupervised model evaluation and ranking in two common deployment settings: (1) estimating the accuracy of a fixed model on multiple unlabeled test sets (dataset-centric evaluation), and (2) ranking a set of candidate models on a single unlabeled test set (model-centric evaluation). We demonstrate that two intrinsic properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes), together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model assessment in deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Upcoming astronomical surveys will produce petabytes of high-resolution images of the night sky, providing information about billions of stars and galaxies. Detecting and characterizing the astronomical objects in these images is a fundamental task in astronomy -- and a challenging one, as most of these objects are faint and many visually overlap with other objects. We propose an amortized variational inference procedure to solve this instance of small-object detection. Our key innovation is a family of spatially autoregressive variational distributions that partition and order the latent space according to a $K$-color checkerboard pattern. By construction, the conditional independencies of this variational family mirror those of the posterior distribution. We fit the variational distribution, which is parameterized by a convolutional neural network, using neural posterior estimation (NPE) to minimize an expectation of the forward KL divergence. Using images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We further demonstrate that the proposed autoregressive structure greatly improves posterior calibration.

Abstract: Visual navigation policy is widely regarded as a promising direction, as it mimics humans by using egocentric visual observations for navigation. However, optical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly modeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires intelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage the intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse navigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner. Specifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360 observations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation models. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three reinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information in three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation capabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA model using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is dynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through extensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model achieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student VLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of integrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further confirm the effectiveness of our method.

Abstract: For equitable deployment of AI tools in hospitals and healthcare facilities, we need Deep Segmentation Networks that offer high performance and can be trained on cost-effective GPUs with limited memory and large batch sizes. In this work, we propose Wave-GMS, a lightweight and efficient multi-scale generative model for medical image segmentation. Wave-GMS has a substantially smaller number of trainable parameters, does not require loading memory-intensive pretrained vision foundation models, and supports training with large batch sizes on GPUs with limited memory. We conducted extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets (BUS, BUSI, Kvasir-Instrument, and HAM10000), demonstrating that Wave-GMS achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance with superior cross-domain generalizability, while requiring only ~2.6M trainable parameters.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have shown incredible promise for zero shot image-to-image translation and editing. Most of these approaches work by combining or replacing network-specific features used in the generation of new images with those taken from the inversion of some guide image. Methods of this type are considered the current state-of-the-art in training-free approaches, but have some notable limitations: they tend to be costly in runtime and memory, and often depend on deterministic sampling that limits variation in generated results. We propose Filter-Guided Diffusion (FGD), an alternative approach that leverages fast filtering operations during the diffusion process to support finer control over the strength and frequencies of guidance and can work with non-deterministic samplers to produce greater variety. With its efficiency, FGD can be sampled over multiple seeds and hyperparameters in less time than a single run of other SOTA methods to produce superior results based on structural and semantic metrics. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments to evaluate the performance of FGD in translation tasks and also demonstrate its potential in localized editing when used with masks.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to transfer the supervision from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. The majority of existing UDA-SS works typically consider images whilst recent attempts have extended further to tackle videos by modeling the temporal dimension. Although the two lines of research share the major challenges -- overcoming the underlying domain distribution shift, their studies are largely independent, resulting in fragmented insights, a lack of holistic understanding, and missed opportunities for cross-pollination of ideas. This fragmentation prevents the unification of methods, leading to redundant efforts and suboptimal knowledge transfer across image and video domains. Under this observation, we advocate unifying the study of UDA-SS across video and image scenarios, enabling a more comprehensive understanding, synergistic advancements, and efficient knowledge sharing. To that end, we explore the unified UDA-SS from a general data augmentation perspective, serving as a unifying conceptual framework, enabling improved generalization, and potential for cross-pollination of ideas, ultimately contributing to the overall progress and practical impact of this field of research. Specifically, we propose a Quad-directional Mixup (QuadMix) method, characterized by tackling distinct point attributes and feature inconsistencies through four-directional paths for intra- and inter-domain mixing in a feature space. To deal with temporal shifts with videos, we incorporate optical flow-guided feature aggregation across spatial and temporal dimensions for fine-grained domain alignment. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art works by large margins on four challenging UDA-SS benchmarks. Our source code and models will be released at https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/UDASS.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is an important image processing operation for agricultural automation, providing precise delineation of individual objects within images and enabling tasks such as selective harvesting and precision pruning. This study compares the one stage YOLOv8 model with the two stage Mask R CNN model for instance segmentation under varying orchard conditions across two datasets. Dataset 1, collected in the dormant season, contains images of apple trees without foliage and was used to train multi object segmentation models delineating branches and trunks. Dataset 2, collected in the early growing season, includes canopy images with green foliage and immature apples and was used to train single object segmentation models delineating fruitlets. Results showed YOLOv8 outperformed Mask R CNN with higher precision and near perfect recall at a confidence threshold of 0.5. For Dataset 1, YOLOv8 achieved precision 0.90 and recall 0.95 compared to 0.81 and 0.81 for Mask R CNN. For Dataset 2, YOLOv8 reached precision 0.93 and recall 0.97 compared to 0.85 and 0.88. Inference times were also lower for YOLOv8, at 10.9 ms and 7.8 ms, versus 15.6 ms and 12.8 ms for Mask R CNN. These findings demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency of YOLOv8 for real time orchard automation tasks such as robotic harvesting and fruit thinning.

Abstract: Recent video generative models primarily rely on carefully written text prompts for specific tasks, like inpainting or style editing. They require labor-intensive textual descriptions for input videos, hindering their flexibility to adapt personal/raw videos to user specifications. This paper proposes RACCooN, a versatile and user-friendly video-to-paragraph-to-video generative framework that supports multiple video editing capabilities such as removal, addition, and modification, through a unified pipeline. RACCooN consists of two principal stages: Video-to-Paragraph (V2P) and Paragraph-to-Video (P2V). In the V2P stage, we automatically describe video scenes in well-structured natural language, capturing both the holistic context and focused object details. Subsequently, in the P2V stage, users can optionally refine these descriptions to guide the video diffusion model, enabling various modifications to the input video, such as removing, changing subjects, and/or adding new objects. The proposed approach stands out from other methods through several significant contributions: (1) RACCooN suggests a multi-granular spatiotemporal pooling strategy to generate well-structured video descriptions, capturing both the broad context and object details without requiring complex human annotations, simplifying precise video content editing based on text for users. (2) Our video generative model incorporates auto-generated narratives or instructions to enhance the quality and accuracy of the generated content. (3) RACCooN also plans to imagine new objects in a given video, so users simply prompt the model to receive a detailed video editing plan for complex video editing. The proposed framework demonstrates impressive versatile capabilities in video-to-paragraph generation, video content editing, and can be incorporated into other SoTA video generative models for further enhancement.

Abstract: Deep generative models have demonstrated impressive performance in various computer vision applications, including image synthesis, video generation, and medical analysis. Despite their significant advancements, these models may be used for malicious purposes, such as misinformation, deception, and copyright violation. In this paper, we provide a systematic and timely review of research efforts on defenses against AI-generated visual media, covering detection, disruption, and authentication. We review existing methods and summarize the mainstream defense-related tasks within a unified passive and proactive framework. Moreover, we survey the derivative tasks concerning the trustworthiness of defenses, such as their robustness and fairness. For each task, we formulate its general pipeline and propose a taxonomy based on methodological strategies that are uniformly applicable to the primary subtasks. Additionally, we summarize the commonly used evaluation datasets, criteria, and metrics. Finally, by analyzing the reviewed studies, we provide insights into current research challenges and suggest possible directions for future research.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have shown significant potential, particularly in zero-shot classification across diverse distribution shifts. Building on existing evaluations of overall classification robustness, this work aims to provide a more comprehensive assessment of CLIP by introducing several new perspectives. First, we investigate their robustness to variations in specific visual factors. Second, we assess two critical safety objectives--confidence uncertainty and out-of-distribution detection--beyond mere classification accuracy. Third, we evaluate the finesse with which CLIP models bridge the image and text modalities. Fourth, we extend our examination to 3D awareness in CLIP models, moving beyond traditional 2D image understanding. Finally, we explore the interaction between vision and language encoders within modern large multimodal models (LMMs) that utilize CLIP as the visual backbone, focusing on how this interaction impacts classification robustness. In each aspect, we consider the impact of six factors on CLIP models: model architecture, training distribution, training set size, fine-tuning, contrastive loss, and test-time prompts. Our study uncovers several previously unknown insights into CLIP. For instance, the architecture of the visual encoder in CLIP plays a significant role in their robustness against 3D corruption. CLIP models tend to exhibit a bias towards shape when making predictions. Moreover, this bias tends to diminish after fine-tuning on ImageNet. Vision-language models like LLaVA, leveraging the CLIP vision encoder, could exhibit benefits in classification performance for challenging categories over CLIP alone. Our findings are poised to offer valuable guidance for enhancing the robustness and reliability of CLIP models.

Abstract: Current zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) methods show remarkable success in prompting large pre-trained vision-language models to detect anomalies in a target dataset without using any dataset-specific training or demonstration. However, these methods often focus on crafting/learning prompts that capture only coarse-grained semantics of abnormality, e.g., high-level semantics like "damaged", "imperfect", or "defective" objects. They therefore have limited capability in recognizing diverse abnormality details that deviate from these general abnormal patterns in various ways. To address this limitation, we propose FAPrompt, a novel framework designed to learn Fine-grained Abnormality Prompts for accurate ZSAD. To this end, a novel Compound Abnormality Prompt learning (CAP) module is introduced in FAPrompt to learn a set of complementary, decomposed abnormality prompts, where abnormality prompts are enforced to model diverse abnormal patterns derived from the same normality semantic. On the other hand, the fine-grained abnormality patterns can be different from one dataset to another. To enhance the cross-dataset generalization, another novel module, namely Data-dependent Abnormality Prior learning (DAP), is introduced in FAPrompt to learn a sample-wise abnormality prior from abnormal features of each test image to dynamically adapt the abnormality prompts to individual test images. Comprehensive experiments on 19 real-world datasets, covering both industrial defects and medical anomalies, demonstrate that FAPrompt substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both image- and pixel-level ZSAD tasks.

Abstract: Can the relative performance of a pre-trained large multimodal model (LMM) be predicted without access to labels? As LMMs proliferate, it becomes increasingly important to develop efficient ways to choose between them when faced with new data or tasks. The usual approach does the equivalent of giving the models an exam and marking them. We opt to avoid marking and the associated labor of determining the ground-truth answers. Instead, we explore other signals elicited and ascertain how well the models know their own limits, evaluating the effectiveness of these signals at unsupervised model ranking. We evaluate $47$ state-of-the-art LMMs (\eg, LLaVA) across $9$ visual question answering benchmarks, analyzing how well uncertainty-based metrics can predict relative model performance. Our findings show that uncertainty scores derived from softmax distributions provide a robust and consistent basis for ranking models across various tasks. This facilitates the ranking of LMMs on unlabeled data, providing a practical approach for selecting models for diverse target domains without requiring manual annotation.

Abstract: In soccer video analysis, player detection is essential for identifying key events and reconstructing tactical positions. The presence of numerous players and frequent occlusions, combined with copyright restrictions, severely restricts the availability of datasets, leaving limited options such as SoccerNet-Tracking and SportsMOT. These datasets suffer from a lack of diversity, which hinders algorithms from adapting effectively to varied soccer video contexts. To address these challenges, we developed SoccerSynth-Detection, the first synthetic dataset designed for the detection of synthetic soccer players. It includes a broad range of random lighting and textures, as well as simulated camera motion blur. We validated its efficacy using the object detection model (Yolov8n) against real-world datasets (SoccerNet-Tracking and SportsMoT). In transfer tests, it matched the performance of real datasets and significantly outperformed them in images with motion blur; in pre-training tests, it demonstrated its efficacy as a pre-training dataset, significantly enhancing the algorithm's overall performance. Our work demonstrates the potential of synthetic datasets to replace real datasets for algorithm training in the field of soccer video analysis.

Abstract: The main challenges limiting the adoption of deep learning-based solutions in medical workflows are the availability of annotated data and the lack of interpretability of such systems. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) tackle the latter by constraining the model output on a set of predefined and human-interpretable concepts. However, the increased interpretability achieved through these concept-based explanations implies a higher annotation burden. Moreover, if a new concept needs to be added, the whole system needs to be retrained. Inspired by the remarkable performance shown by Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in few-shot settings, we propose a simple, yet effective, methodology, CBVLM, which tackles both of the aforementioned challenges. First, for each concept, we prompt the LVLM to answer if the concept is present in the input image. Then, we ask the LVLM to classify the image based on the previous concept predictions. Moreover, in both stages, we incorporate a retrieval module responsible for selecting the best examples for in-context learning. By grounding the final diagnosis on the predicted concepts, we ensure explainability, and by leveraging the few-shot capabilities of LVLMs, we drastically lower the annotation cost. We validate our approach with extensive experiments across four medical datasets and twelve LVLMs (both generic and medical) and show that CBVLM consistently outperforms CBMs and task-specific supervised methods without requiring any training and using just a few annotated examples.

Abstract: This paper introduces Gate-Shift-Pose, an enhanced version of Gate-Shift-Fuse networks, designed for athlete fall classification in figure skating by integrating skeleton pose data alongside RGB frames. We evaluate two fusion strategies: early-fusion, which combines RGB frames with Gaussian heatmaps of pose keypoints at the input stage, and late-fusion, which employs a multi-stream architecture with attention mechanisms to combine RGB and pose features. Experiments on the FR-FS dataset demonstrate that Gate-Shift-Pose significantly outperforms the RGB-only baseline, improving accuracy by up to 40% with ResNet18 and 20% with ResNet50. Early-fusion achieves the highest accuracy (98.08%) with ResNet50, leveraging the model's capacity for effective multimodal integration, while late-fusion is better suited for lighter backbones like ResNet18. These results highlight the potential of multimodal architectures for sports action recognition and the critical role of skeleton pose information in capturing complex motion patterns.

Abstract: Exemplar-free Class Incremental Learning (EFCIL) aims to learn from a sequence of tasks without having access to previous task data. In this paper, we consider the challenging Cold Start scenario in which insufficient data is available in the first task to learn a high-quality backbone. This is especially challenging for EFCIL since it requires high plasticity, resulting in feature drift which is difficult to compensate for in the exemplar-free setting. To address this problem, we propose an effective approach to consolidate feature representations by regularizing drift in directions highly relevant to previous tasks while employing prototypes to reduce task-recency bias. Our approach, which we call Elastic Feature Consolidation++ (EFC++) exploits a tractable second-order approximation of feature drift based on a proposed Empirical Feature Matrix (EFM). The EFM induces a pseudo-metric in feature space which we use to regularize feature drift in important directions and to update Gaussian prototypes. In addition, we introduce a post-training prototype re-balancing phase that updates classifiers to compensate for feature drift. Experimental results on CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-Subset, ImageNet-1K and DomainNet demonstrate that EFC++ is better able to learn new tasks by maintaining model plasticity and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Environment description-based localization in large-scale point cloud maps constructed through remote sensing is critically significant for the advancement of large-scale autonomous systems, such as delivery robots operating in the last mile. However, current approaches encounter challenges due to the inability of point cloud encoders to effectively capture local details and long-range spatial relationships, as well as a significant modality gap between text and point cloud representations. To address these challenges, we present Des4Pos, a novel two-stage text-driven remote sensing localization framework. In the coarse stage, the point-cloud encoder utilizes the Multi-scale Fusion Attention Mechanism (MFAM) to enhance local geometric features, followed by a bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) module to strengthen global spatial relationships. Concurrently, the Stepped Text Encoder (STE) integrates cross-modal prior knowledge from CLIP [1] and aligns text and point-cloud features using this prior knowledge, effectively bridging modality discrepancies. In the fine stage, we introduce a Cascaded Residual Attention (CRA) module to fuse cross-modal features and predict relative localization offsets, thereby achieving greater localization precision. Experiments on the KITTI360Pose test set demonstrate that Des4Pos achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-point-cloud place recognition. Specifically, it attains a top-1 accuracy of 40% and a top-10 accuracy of 77% under a 5-meter radius threshold, surpassing the best existing methods by 7% and 7%, respectively.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the task of multimodal-to-speech generation, which aims to synthesize high-quality speech from multiple input modalities: text, video, and reference audio. This task has gained increasing attention due to its wide range of applications, such as film production, dubbing, and virtual avatars. Despite recent progress, existing methods still suffer from limitations in speech intelligibility, audio-video synchronization, speech naturalness, and voice similarity to the reference speaker. To address these challenges, we propose AlignDiT, a multimodal Aligned Diffusion Transformer that generates accurate, synchronized, and natural-sounding speech from aligned multimodal inputs. Built upon the in-context learning capability of the DiT architecture, AlignDiT explores three effective strategies to align multimodal representations. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal classifier-free guidance mechanism that allows the model to adaptively balance information from each modality during speech synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignDiT significantly outperforms existing methods across multiple benchmarks in terms of quality, synchronization, and speaker similarity. Moreover, AlignDiT exhibits strong generalization capability across various multimodal tasks, such as video-to-speech synthesis and visual forced alignment, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Monocular height estimation (MHE) from very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery via deep learning is notoriously challenging due to the lack of sufficient structural information. Conventional digital elevation models (DEMs), typically derived from airborne LiDAR or multi-view stereo, remain costly and geographically limited. Recently, models trained on synthetic data and refined through domain adaptation have shown remarkable performance in MHE, yet it remains unclear how these models make predictions or how reliable they truly are. In this paper, we investigate a state-of-the-art MHE model trained purely on synthetic data to explore where the model looks when making height predictions. Through systematic analyses, we find that the model relies heavily on shadow cues, a factor that can lead to overestimation or underestimation of heights when shadows deviate from expected norms. Furthermore, the inherent difficulty of evaluating regression tasks with the human eye underscores additional limitations of purely synthetic training. To address these issues, we propose a novel correction pipeline that integrates sparse, imperfect global LiDAR measurements (ICESat-2) with deep-learning outputs to improve local accuracy and achieve spatially consistent corrections. Our method comprises two stages: pre-processing raw ICESat-2 data, followed by a random forest-based approach to densely refine height estimates. Experiments in three representative urban regions -- Saint-Omer, Tokyo, and Sao Paulo -- reveal substantial error reductions, with mean absolute error (MAE) decreased by 22.8\%, 6.9\%, and 4.9\%, respectively. These findings highlight the critical role of shadow awareness in synthetic data-driven models and demonstrate how fusing imperfect real-world LiDAR data can bolster the robustness of MHE, paving the way for more reliable and scalable 3D mapping solutions.

Abstract: Assessing human skill levels in complex activities is a challenging problem with applications in sports, rehabilitation, and training. In this work, we present SkillFormer, a parameter-efficient architecture for unified multi-view proficiency estimation from egocentric and exocentric videos. Building on the TimeSformer backbone, SkillFormer introduces a CrossViewFusion module that fuses view-specific features using multi-head cross-attention, learnable gating, and adaptive self-calibration. We leverage Low-Rank Adaptation to fine-tune only a small subset of parameters, significantly reducing training costs. In fact, when evaluated on the EgoExo4D dataset, SkillFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in multi-view settings while demonstrating remarkable computational efficiency, using 4.5x fewer parameters and requiring 3.75x fewer training epochs than prior baselines. It excels in multiple structured tasks, confirming the value of multi-view integration for fine-grained skill assessment. Project page at https://edowhite.github.io/SkillFormer

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-powered generative models have enabled the creation of increasingly realistic synthetic images, posing significant risks to information integrity and public trust on social media platforms. While robust detection frameworks and diverse, large-scale datasets are essential to mitigate these risks, existing academic efforts remain limited in scope: current datasets lack the diversity, scale, and realism required for social media contexts, while detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen generative technologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce So-Fake-Set, a comprehensive social media-oriented dataset with over 2 million high-quality images, diverse generative sources, and photorealistic imagery synthesized using 35 state-of-the-art generative models. To rigorously evaluate cross-domain robustness, we establish a novel and large-scale (100K) out-of-domain benchmark (So-Fake-OOD) featuring synthetic imagery from commercial models explicitly excluded from the training distribution, creating a realistic testbed for evaluating real-world performance. Leveraging these resources, we present So-Fake-R1, an advanced vision-language framework that employs reinforcement learning for highly accurate forgery detection, precise localization, and explainable inference through interpretable visual rationales. Extensive experiments show that So-Fake-R1 outperforms the second-best method, with a 1.3% gain in detection accuracy and a 4.5% increase in localization IoU. By integrating a scalable dataset, a challenging OOD benchmark, and an advanced detection framework, this work establishes a new foundation for social media-centric forgery detection research. The code, models, and datasets will be released publicly.

Abstract: Several variants of reweighted risk functionals, such as focal loss, inverse focal loss, and the Area Under the Risk--Coverage Curve (AURC), have been proposed for improving model calibration, yet their theoretical connections to calibration errors remain unclear. In this paper, we revisit a broad class of weighted risk functions commonly used in deep learning and establish a principled connection between calibration error and selective classification. We show that minimizing calibration error is closely linked to the selective classification paradigm and demonstrate that optimizing selective risk in low-confidence region naturally leads to improved calibration. This loss shares a similar reweighting strategy with dual focal loss but offers greater flexibility through the choice of confidence score functions (CSFs). Our approach uses a bin-based cumulative distribution function (CDF) approximation, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization without requiring expensive sorting and achieving $O(nK)$ complexity. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive calibration performance across a range of datasets and model architectures.

Abstract: Automated sports skill assessment requires capturing fundamental movement patterns that distinguish expert from novice performance, yet current video sampling methods disrupt the temporal continuity essential for proficiency evaluation. To this end, we introduce Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling (PATS), a novel sampling strategy that preserves complete fundamental movements within continuous temporal segments for multi-view skill assessment. PATS adaptively segments videos to ensure each analyzed portion contains full execution of critical performance components, repeating this process across multiple segments to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal coherence. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark with SkillFormer, PATS surpasses the state-of-the-art accuracy across all viewing configurations (+0.65% to +3.05%) and delivers substantial gains in challenging domains (+26.22% bouldering, +2.39% music, +1.13% basketball). Systematic analysis reveals that PATS successfully adapts to diverse activity characteristics-from high-frequency sampling for dynamic sports to fine-grained segmentation for sequential skills-demonstrating its effectiveness as an adaptive approach to temporal sampling that advances automated skill assessment for real-world applications.

Abstract: Action segmentation is a core challenge in high-level video understanding, aiming to partition untrimmed videos into segments and assign each a label from a predefined action set. Existing methods primarily address single-person activities with fixed action sequences, overlooking multi-person scenarios. In this work, we pioneer textual reference-guided human action segmentation in multi-person settings, where a textual description specifies the target person for segmentation. We introduce the first dataset for Referring Human Action Segmentation, i.e., RHAS133, built from 133 movies and annotated with 137 fine-grained actions with 33h video data, together with textual descriptions for this new task. Benchmarking existing action segmentation methods on RHAS133 using VLM-based feature extractors reveals limited performance and poor aggregation of visual cues for the target person. To address this, we propose a holistic-partial aware Fourier-conditioned diffusion framework, i.e., HopaDIFF, leveraging a novel cross-input gate attentional xLSTM to enhance holistic-partial long-range reasoning and a novel Fourier condition to introduce more fine-grained control to improve the action segmentation generation. HopaDIFF achieves state-of-the-art results on RHAS133 in diverse evaluation settings. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/KPeng9510/HopaDIFF.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have attracted increasing attention for their strong control capabilities. However, their high computational cost and low execution frequency hinder their suitability for real-time tasks such as robotic manipulation and autonomous navigation. Existing VLA acceleration methods primarily focus on structural optimization, overlooking the fact that these models operate in sequential decision-making environments. As a result, temporal redundancy in sequential action generation and spatial redundancy in visual input remain unaddressed. To this end, we propose SP-VLA, a unified framework that accelerates VLA models by jointly scheduling models and pruning tokens. Specifically, we design an action-aware model scheduling mechanism that reduces temporal redundancy by dynamically switching between VLA model and a lightweight generator. Inspired by the human motion pattern of focusing on key decision points while relying on intuition for other actions, we categorize VLA actions into deliberative and intuitive, assigning the former to the VLA model and the latter to the lightweight generator, enabling frequency-adaptive execution through collaborative model scheduling. To address spatial redundancy, we further develop a spatio-semantic dual-aware token pruning method. Tokens are classified into spatial and semantic types and pruned based on their dual-aware importance to accelerate VLA inference. These two mechanisms work jointly to guide the VLA in focusing on critical actions and salient visual information, achieving effective acceleration while maintaining high accuracy. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves 1.5$\times$ lossless acceleration in LIBERO and 2.4$\times$ in SimplerEnv, with up to 6% average performance gain. Inference frequency and latency improve by 2.2$\times$ in SimplerEnv and 1.4$\times$ in LIBERO.

Abstract: The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks: highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500 professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., canny edge) for fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning-based approaches. However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly from natural RGB distributions. Through an empirical analysis of existing methods, we identify a key limitation: the sampling schedule of condition features, previously unexplored, fails to account for the evolving interplay between structure preservation and domain alignment throughout diffusion steps. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible training-free framework that decouples the sampling schedule of condition features from the denoising process, and systematically investigate the spectrum of feature injection schedules for a higher-quality structure guidance in the feature space. Specifically, we find that condition features sampled from a single timestep are sufficient, yielding a simple yet efficient schedule that balances structure alignment and appearance quality. We further enhance the sampling process by introducing a restart refinement schedule, and improve the visual quality with an appearance-rich prompting strategy. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse zero-shot conditioning scenarios.

Abstract: Recent large-scale Vision Language Action (VLA) models have shown superior performance in robotic manipulation tasks guided by natural language. However, current VLA models suffer from two drawbacks: (i) generation of massive tokens leading to high inference latency and increased training cost, and (ii) insufficient utilization of generated actions resulting in potential performance loss. To address these issues, we develop a training framework to finetune VLA models for generating significantly fewer action tokens with high parallelism, effectively reducing inference latency and training cost. Furthermore, we introduce an inference optimization technique with a novel voting-based ensemble strategy to combine current and previous action predictions, improving the utilization of generated actions and overall performance. Our results demonstrate that we achieve superior performance compared with state-of-the-art VLA models, achieving significantly higher success rates and 39$\times$ faster inference than OpenVLA with 46 Hz throughput on edge platforms, demonstrating practical deployability.

Abstract: Speed bumps and potholes are the most common road anomalies, significantly affecting ride comfort and vehicle stability. Preview-based suspension control mitigates their impact by detecting such irregularities in advance and adjusting suspension parameters proactively. Accurate and real-time detection is essential, but embedded deployment is constrained by limited computational resources and the small size of targets in input images.To address these challenges, this paper proposes SBP-YOLO, an efficient detection framework for speed bumps and potholes in embedded systems. Built upon YOLOv11n, it integrates GhostConv and VoVGSCSPC modules in the backbone and neck to reduce computation while enhancing multi-scale semantic features. A P2-level branch improves small-object detection, and a lightweight and efficient detection head (LEDH) maintains accuracy with minimal overhead. A hybrid training strategy further enhances robustness under varying road and environmental conditions, combining NWD loss, BCKD knowledge distillation, and Albumentations-based augmentation. Experiments show that SBP-YOLO achieves 87.0% mAP, outperforming the YOLOv11n baseline by 5.8%. After TensorRT FP16 quantization, it runs at 139.5 FPS on Jetson AGX Xavier, yielding a 12.4% speedup over the P2-enhanced YOLOv11. These results demonstrate the framework's suitability for fast, low-latency road condition perception in embedded suspension control systems.

Abstract: Visual manipulation localization (VML) aims to identify tampered regions in images and videos, a task that has become increasingly challenging with the rise of advanced editing tools. Existing methods face two main issues: resolution diversity, where resizing or padding distorts forensic traces and reduces efficiency, and the modality gap, as images and videos often require separate models. To address these challenges, we propose RelayFormer, a unified framework that adapts to varying resolutions and modalities. RelayFormer partitions inputs into fixed-size sub-images and introduces Global-Local Relay (GLR) tokens, which propagate structured context through a global-local relay attention (GLRA) mechanism. This enables efficient exchange of global cues, such as semantic or temporal consistency, while preserving fine-grained manipulation artifacts. Unlike prior methods that rely on uniform resizing or sparse attention, RelayFormer naturally scales to arbitrary resolutions and video sequences without excessive overhead. Experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that RelayFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance with notable efficiency, combining resolution adaptivity without interpolation or excessive padding, unified modeling for both images and videos, and a strong balance between accuracy and computational cost. Code is available at: https://github.com/WenOOI/RelayFormer.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-audio (TTA) generation excel at synthesizing short audio clips but struggle with long-form narrative audio, which requires temporal coherence and compositional reasoning. To address this gap, we propose AudioStory, a unified framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with TTA systems to generate structured, long-form audio narratives. AudioStory possesses strong instruction-following reasoning generation capabilities. It employs LLMs to decompose complex narrative queries into temporally ordered sub-tasks with contextual cues, enabling coherent scene transitions and emotional tone consistency. AudioStory has two appealing features: (1) Decoupled bridging mechanism: AudioStory disentangles LLM-diffuser collaboration into two specialized components, i.e., a bridging query for intra-event semantic alignment and a residual query for cross-event coherence preservation. (2) End-to-end training: By unifying instruction comprehension and audio generation within a single end-to-end framework, AudioStory eliminates the need for modular training pipelines while enhancing synergy between components. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark AudioStory-10K, encompassing diverse domains such as animated soundscapes and natural sound narratives. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AudioStory on both single-audio generation and narrative audio generation, surpassing prior TTA baselines in both instruction-following ability and audio fidelity.

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning. Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized Representation Learning that integrates both affordance-guided reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet structures . This enables our model to identify tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns language with image content at both global and regional levels. These contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. The source code is available at https://github.com/lzzhhh1019/CRL.

Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances.

<title>Towards Size-invariant Salient Object Detection: A Generic Evaluation and Optimization Approach</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15573</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2509.15573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient Object Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols, particularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly different sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed. The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present generalization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the validity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments speak to the efficacy of our proposed approach. The code is available at https://github.com/Ferry-Li/SI-SOD.

Abstract: Streaming visual transformers like StreamVGGT achieve strong 3D perception but suffer from unbounded growth of key value (KV) memory, which limits scalability. We propose a training-free, inference-time token eviction policy that bounds memory by discarding redundant tokens while keeping the most informative ones. Our method uses significantly less memory with little to no drop in accuracy: on 7-Scenes with long sequences it reduces peak memory from 18.63 GB to 9.39 GB while accuracy and completeness drop by only 0.003. Under strict memory budgets, eviction enables denser frame sampling, which improves reconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline. Experiments across video depth estimation (Sintel, KITTI), 3D reconstruction (7-Scenes, NRGBD), and camera pose estimation (Sintel, TUM-dynamics) show that our approach closely matches StreamVGGT at a fraction of the memory and makes long-horizon streaming inference more practical.

<title>Addressing Representation Collapse in Vector Quantized Models with One Linear Layer</title>

Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is essential for discretizing continuous representations in unsupervised learning but suffers from representation collapse, causing low codebook utilization and limiting scalability. Existing solutions often rely on complex optimizations or reduce latent dimensionality, which compromises model capacity and fails to fully solve the problem. We identify the root cause as disjoint codebook optimization, where only a few code vectors are updated via gradient descent. To fix this, we propose \textbf{Sim}ple\textbf{VQ}, which reparameterizes code vectors through a learnable linear transformation layer over a latent basis, optimizing the \textit{entire linear space} rather than nearest \textit{individual code vectors}. Although the multiplication of two linear matrices is equivalent to applying a single linear layer, this simple approach effectively prevents collapse. Extensive experiments on image and audio tasks demonstrate that SimVQ improves codebook usage, is easy to implement, and generalizes well across modalities and architectures.

<title>WaveNet-SF: A Hybrid Network for Retinal Disease Detection Based on Wavelet Transform in Spatial-Frequency Domain</title>

Abstract: Retinal diseases are a leading cause of vision impairment and blindness, with timely diagnosis being critical for effective treatment. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) has become a standard imaging modality for retinal disease diagnosis, but OCT images often suffer from issues such as speckle noise, complex lesion shapes, and varying lesion sizes, making interpretation challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, WaveNet-SF, to enhance retinal disease detection by integrating the spatial-domain and frequency-domain learning. The framework utilizes wavelet transforms to decompose OCT images into low- and high-frequency components, enabling the model to extract both global structural features and fine-grained details. To improve lesion detection, we introduce a Multi-Scale Wavelet Spatial Attention (MSW-SA) module, which enhances the model's focus on regions of interest at multiple scales. Additionally, a High-Frequency Feature Compensation (HFFC) block is incorporated to recover edge information lost during wavelet decomposition, suppress noise, and preserve fine details crucial for lesion detection. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) classification accuracies of 97.82% and 99.58% on the OCT-C8 and OCT2017 datasets, respectively, surpassing existing methods. These results demonstrate the efficacy of WaveNet-SF in addressing the challenges of OCT image analysis and its potential as a powerful tool for retinal disease diagnosis.

Abstract: The hierarchical structure of 3D scene graphs shows a high relevance for representations purposes, as it fits common patterns from man-made environments. But, additionally, the semantic and geometric information in such hierarchical representations could be leveraged to speed up the optimization and management of map elements and robot poses.
  In this direction, we present our work Situational Graphs 2.0 (S-Graphs 2.0), which leverages the hierarchical structure of indoor scenes for efficient data management and optimization. Our algorithm begins by constructing a situational graph that represents the environment into four layers: Keyframes, Walls, Rooms, and Floors. Our first novelty lies in the front-end, which includes a floor detection module capable of identifying stairways and assigning floor-level semantic relations to the underlying layers. Floor-level semantics allows us to propose a floor-based loop closure strategy, that effectively rejects false positive closures that typically appear due to aliasing between different floors of a building. Our second novelty lies in leveraging our representation hierarchy in the optimization. Our proposal consists of: (1) local optimization over a window of recent keyframes and their connected components across the four representation layers, (2) floor-level global optimization, which focuses only on keyframes and their connections within the current floor during loop closures, and (3) room-level local optimization, marginalizing redundant keyframes that share observations within the room, which reduces the computational footprint. We validate our algorithm extensively in different real multi-floor environments. Our approach shows state-of-art-art accuracy metrics in large-scale multi-floor environments, estimating hierarchical representations up to 10x faster, in average, than competing baselines

Abstract: Self-modeling enables robots to build task-agnostic models of their morphology and kinematics based on data that can be automatically collected, with minimal human intervention and prior information, thereby enhancing machine intelligence. Recent research has highlighted the potential of data-driven technology in modeling the morphology and kinematics of robots. However, existing self-modeling methods suffer from either low modeling quality or excessive data acquisition costs. Beyond morphology and kinematics, texture is also a crucial component of robots, which is challenging to model and remains unexplored. In this work, a high-quality, texture-aware, and link-level method is proposed for robot self-modeling. We utilize three-dimensional (3D) Gaussians to represent the static morphology and texture of robots, and cluster the 3D Gaussians to construct neural ellipsoid bones, whose deformations are controlled by the transformation matrices generated by a kinematic neural network. The 3D Gaussians and kinematic neural network are trained using data pairs composed of joint angles, camera parameters and multi-view images without depth information. By feeding the kinematic neural network with joint angles, we can utilize the well-trained model to describe the corresponding morphology, kinematics and texture of robots at the link level, and render robot images from different perspectives with the aid of 3D Gaussian splatting. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the established model can be exploited to perform downstream tasks such as motion planning and inverse kinematics.

Abstract: We present a benchmarking study of vision-based robotic grasping algorithms with distinct approaches, and provide a comparative analysis. In particular, we compare two machine-learning-based and two analytical algorithms using an existing benchmarking protocol from the literature and determine the algorithm's strengths and weaknesses under different experimental conditions. These conditions include variations in lighting, background textures, cameras with different noise levels, and grippers. We also run analogous experiments in simulations and with real robots and present the discrepancies. Some experiments are also run in two different laboratories using same protocols to further analyze the repeatability of our results. We believe that this study, comprising 5040 experiments, provides important insights into the role and challenges of systematic experimentation in robotic manipulation, and guides the development of new algorithms by considering the factors that could impact the performance. The experiment recordings and our benchmarking software are publicly available.

arXiv:2505.01476v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) seeks to localize the anomaly mask of an input image with respect to normal samples. Either by reconstructing normal counterparts (reconstruction-based) or by learning an image feature embedding space (embedding-based), existing approaches fundamentally rely on image-level or feature-level matching to derive anomaly scores. Often, such a matching process is inaccurate yet overlooked, leading to sub-optimal detection. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of cost filtering, borrowed from classical matching tasks, such as depth and flow estimation, into the UAD problem. We call this approach {\em CostFilter-AD}. Specifically, we first construct a matching cost volume between the input and normal samples, comprising two spatial dimensions and one matching dimension that encodes potential matches. To refine this, we propose a cost volume filtering network, guided by the input observation as an attention query across multiple feature layers, which effectively suppresses matching noise while preserving edge structures and capturing subtle anomalies. Designed as a generic post-processing plug-in, CostFilter-AD can be integrated with either reconstruction-based or embedding-based methods. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA benchmarks validate the generic benefits of CostFilter-AD for both single- and multi-class UAD tasks. Code and models will be released at https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD.

Abstract: Generative models have recently been explored for synthesizing neural network weights. These approaches take neural network checkpoints as training data and aim to generate high-performing weights during inference. In this work, we examine four representative, well-known methods on their ability to generate novel model weights, i.e., weights that are different from the checkpoints seen during training. Contrary to claims in prior work, we find that these methods synthesize weights largely by memorization: they produce either replicas, or, at best, simple interpolations of the training checkpoints. Moreover, they fail to outperform simple baselines, such as adding noise to the weights or taking a simple weight ensemble, in obtaining different and simultaneously high-performing models. Our further analysis suggests that this memorization might result from limited data, overparameterized models, and the underuse of structural priors specific to weight data. These findings highlight the need for more careful design and rigorous evaluation of generative models when applied to new domains. Our code is available at https://github.com/boyazeng/weight_memorization.

Abstract: Recent progress in dense SLAM has primarily targeted monocular setups, often at the expense of robustness and geometric coverage. We present MCGS-SLAM, the first purely RGB-based multi-camera SLAM system built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike prior methods relying on sparse maps or inertial data, MCGS-SLAM fuses dense RGB inputs from multiple viewpoints into a unified, continuously optimized Gaussian map. A multi-camera bundle adjustment (MCBA) jointly refines poses and depths via dense photometric and geometric residuals, while a scale consistency module enforces metric alignment across views using low-rank priors. The system supports RGB input and maintains real-time performance at large scale. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that MCGS-SLAM consistently yields accurate trajectories and photorealistic reconstructions, usually outperforming monocular baselines. Notably, the wide field of view from multi-camera input enables reconstruction of side-view regions that monocular setups miss, critical for safe autonomous operation. These results highlight the promise of multi-camera Gaussian Splatting SLAM for high-fidelity mapping in robotics and autonomous driving.

Summary: Computational imaging methods are advancing with the use of generative diffusion models for image restoration tasks. Current techniques based on zero-shot image inverse solvers rely on text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve high accuracy and quality efficiently. However, extending these methods to high-definition video restoration has been challenging due to the need for fine spatial detail and temporal consistency. The new approach proposed in this study, LVTINO, leverages Video Consistency Models (VCMs) to capture temporal causality and achieve high-definition video restoration efficiently. By encoding priors using VCMs, LVTINO outperforms existing methods by providing strong measurement consistency, smooth temporal transitions, and improved reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate significant perceptual enhancements, establishing a new benchmark in video restoration fidelity and computational efficiency. <br /><br /> <div>

Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular, state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model, by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset, whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions, to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.

<div> struggle determination, skill acquisition, dataset, temporal action localization, experimental results 

Summary: 
The article presents a new dataset aimed at determining when a person struggles during skill acquisition. The dataset consists of 61.68 hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated struggle segments from 76 participants performing tasks such as tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and shuffling cards. Participants repeated tasks five times to capture the evolution of their skills. The struggle determination problem is defined as a temporal action localization task to identify and localize struggle segments accurately. Experimental results show that Temporal Action Localization models can effectively detect struggle cues across different tasks and activities, achieving an average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across activities. The dataset, along with the research findings, can help optimize human learning and develop assistive systems for skill acquisition. Available dataset: https://github.com/FELIXFENG2019/EvoStruggle.

Abstract: The ability to determine when a person struggles during skill acquisition is crucial for both optimizing human learning and enabling the development of effective assistive systems. As skills develop, the type and frequency of struggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to determining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing manipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time. In this work, we collect a dataset for struggle determination, featuring 61.68 hours of video recordings, 2,793 videos, and 5,385 annotated temporal struggle segments collected from 76 participants. The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped into four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and shuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition, participants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of skill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action localization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle segments with start and end times. Experimental results show that Temporal Action Localization models can successfully learn to detect struggle cues, even when evaluated on unseen tasks or activities. The models attain an overall average mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across activities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various skill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in struggle detection.

Abstract: We introduce Small PDE U-Net Solver (SPUS), a compact and efficient foundation model (FM) designed as a unified neural operator for solving a wide range of partial differential equations (PDEs). Unlike existing state-of-the-art PDE FMs-primarily based on large complex transformer architectures with high computational and parameter overhead-SPUS leverages a lightweight residual U-Net-based architecture that has been largely underexplored as a foundation model architecture in this domain. To enable effective learning in this minimalist framework, we utilize a simple yet powerful auto-regressive pretraining strategy which closely replicates the behavior of numerical solvers to learn the underlying physics. SPUS is pretrained on a diverse set of fluid dynamics PDEs and evaluated across 6 challenging unseen downstream PDEs spanning various physical systems. Experimental results demonstrate that SPUS using residual U-Net based architecture achieves state-of-the-art generalization on these downstream tasks while requiring significantly fewer parameters and minimal fine-tuning data, highlighting its potential as a highly parameter-efficient FM for solving diverse PDE systems.

Summary: 
DisCo introduces the DisCo framework, which uses RL to optimize identity diversity in multi-human image generation. It fine-tunes flow-matching models using Group-Relative Policy Optimization and rewards that penalize facial similarity within images, discourage identity repetition across samples, enforce accurate person counts, and maintain visual fidelity based on human preference scores. DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and excellent Global Identity Spread on the DiverseHumans Testset, surpassing existing methods like Gemini and GPT-Image while maintaining high perceptual quality. This approach is scalable, requires no extra annotations, and sets a new benchmark for compositional multi-human generation, addressing the identity crisis commonly seen in generative models. <div>

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at realism but collapse on multi-human prompts - duplicating faces, merging identities, and miscounting individuals. We introduce DisCo (Reinforcement with Diversity Constraints), the first RL-based framework to directly optimize identity diversity in multi-human generation. DisCo fine-tunes flow-matching models via Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a compositional reward that (i) penalizes intra-image facial similarity, (ii) discourages cross-sample identity repetition, (iii) enforces accurate person counts, and (iv) preserves visual fidelity through human preference scores. A single-stage curriculum stabilizes training as complexity scales, requiring no extra annotations. On the DiverseHumans Testset, DisCo achieves 98.6 Unique Face Accuracy and near-perfect Global Identity Spread - surpassing both open-source and proprietary methods (e.g., Gemini, GPT-Image) while maintaining competitive perceptual quality. Our results establish DisCo as a scalable, annotation-free solution that resolves the long-standing identity crisis in generative models and sets a new benchmark for compositional multi-human generation.

Summary: <br /><br /> The study focuses on worldwide visual geo-localization using a novel geographic representation that models the world as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. The approach efficiently fuses appearance features of the query image with its semantic segmentation map to create a robust visual representation. Results show improvement in 22 out of 25 metrics across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art methods and Large Vision-Language Models. Ablation studies suggest that the gains are primarily due to the combination of geographic and visual representations. <div>

Abstract: Worldwide visual geo-localization seeks to determine the geographic location of an image anywhere on Earth using only its visual content. Learned representations of geography for visual geo-localization remain an active research topic despite much progress. We formulate geo-localization as aligning the visual representation of the query image with a learned geographic representation. Our novel geographic representation explicitly models the world as a hierarchy of geographic embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an approach to efficiently fuse the appearance features of the query image with its semantic segmentation map, forming a robust visual representation. Our main experiments demonstrate improved all-time bests in 22 out of 25 metrics measured across five benchmark datasets compared to prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Additional ablation studies support the claim that these gains are primarily driven by the combination of geographic and visual representations.

Summary:<br />
This article introduces XMAS, a method for data-efficient instruction tuning of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). The approach is based on the principle that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during instruction tuning have similar gradients, thus influencing model parameters in a similar manner. By clustering examples based on attention matrix trajectories, XMAS efficiently removes redundancy in training data. Experiments demonstrate that XMAS can discard a significant portion of the dataset while maintaining performance on downstream benchmarks and speeding up training. Specifically, XMAS achieves a 30% greater data reduction compared to the best baseline method for LVLMs, showcasing its effectiveness in optimizing data utilization for large-scale models.

Abstract: Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at https://bigml-cs-ucla.github.io/XMAS-project-page/.

Summary:  
Purrception introduces a novel approach for vector-quantized image generation by combining Variational Flow Matching with categorical supervision. By learning categorical posteriors over codebook indices and computing velocity fields in the continuous embedding space, the method bridges continuous transport dynamics with discrete supervision. This allows for uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled generation. Evaluation on ImageNet-1k shows faster convergence in training compared to baseline methods, with competitive FID scores against state-of-the-art models. Purrception demonstrates the effectiveness of combining continuous and discrete approaches for improved training efficiency in image generation.<br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models. This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency in image generation.

<div> Keyword: deep learning, contrast-enhanced CT, abdominal aortic aneurysms, image synthesis, anatomical segmentation

Summary: 
This study introduces a unified deep learning framework to generate synthetic contrast-enhanced CT images of abdominal aortic aneurysms without the need for iodinated contrast agents. The framework combines conditional diffusion models with multi-task learning, allowing for simultaneous image synthesis and anatomical segmentation. Unlike previous models, this approach eliminates the need for initial predictions and utilizes a semi-supervised training strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels. Evaluation on a patient cohort demonstrates superior performance in image synthesis and anatomical segmentation compared to state-of-the-art models. The model achieved a PSNR of 25.61 dB for image synthesis and improved lumen and thrombus Dice scores. These enhancements lead to more accurate clinical measurements, reducing errors in lumen diameter and thrombus area. The code for this framework is available on GitHub for further research and development. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks, including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning, enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of 264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61 dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation, it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to nnU-Net.

Summary:
This paper introduces a framework for prototyping pipelines for multi-modal content analysis, addressing the challenges of combining pre-trained models with complex data like videos. The framework proposes a recipe that utilizes a set of pre-trained models to convert videos into a temporal semi-structured data format. It further transforms this data into a frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation, allowing for query-able and continual learning capabilities. The system enables the dynamic integration of new domain-specific knowledge through interactive means, facilitating knowledge expansion and evolution over time. This approach streamlines the computational process of analyzing multi-modal content and enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of content analysis tasks. The framework offers a flexible and interactive platform for developing and refining multi-modal content analysis pipelines, making it easier for researchers and practitioners to explore and leverage pre-trained models in the context of videos.

Abstract: Analysis of multi-modal content can be tricky, computationally expensive, and require a significant amount of engineering efforts. Lots of work with pre-trained models on static data is out there, yet fusing these opensource models and methods with complex data such as videos is relatively challenging. In this paper, we present a framework that enables efficiently prototyping pipelines for multi-modal content analysis. We craft a candidate recipe for a pipeline, marrying a set of pre-trained models, to convert videos into a temporal semi-structured data format. We translate this structure further to a frame-level indexed knowledge graph representation that is query-able and supports continual learning, enabling the dynamic incorporation of new domain-specific knowledge through an interactive medium.

Summary:  
WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools) is a framework that aims to enhance browser automation by reverse-engineering website functionality into reusable tools. Instead of relying on step-by-step UI interactions, WALT enables agents to call high-level operations such as search, filter, and sort, shifting the computational burden from fragile reasoning to reliable tool invocation. By abstracting away low-level execution details, WALT allows agents to achieve higher success rates with fewer steps and less dependency on heavy LLM reasoning. The framework exposes robust implementations of automations already present in websites, including discovery, communication, and content management tasks. Through experiments on VisualWebArena and WebArena, WALT demonstrates a more robust and generalizable approach to browser automation.

arXiv:2510.01524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web agents promise to automate complex browser tasks, but current methods remain brittle -- relying on step-by-step UI interactions and heavy LLM reasoning that break under dynamic layouts and long horizons. Humans, by contrast, exploit website-provided functionality through high-level operations like search, filter, and sort. We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools), a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation. On VisualWebArena and WebArena, WALT achieves higher success with fewer steps and less LLM-dependent reasoning, establishing a robust and generalizable paradigm for browser automation.

In the field of histopathology image analysis, a novel semi-supervised segmentation framework has been introduced to effectively capture meaningful semantic structures from unlabeled data. The method utilizes multiple perturbed predictions generated through stochastic dropouts and temporal training snapshots to enforce topological consistency, aiding in distinguishing biologically relevant structures from noise. A unique matching strategy combining spatial overlap with global structural alignment is employed to accurately match corresponding topological features across predictions. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the approach in reducing topological errors and producing more robust and accurate segmentations crucial for downstream analysis.

arXiv:2510.01532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In semi-supervised segmentation, capturing meaningful semantic structures from unlabeled data is essential. This is particularly challenging in histopathology image analysis, where objects are densely distributed. To address this issue, we propose a semi-supervised segmentation framework designed to robustly identify and preserve relevant topological features. Our method leverages multiple perturbed predictions obtained through stochastic dropouts and temporal training snapshots, enforcing topological consistency across these varied outputs. This consistency mechanism helps distinguish biologically meaningful structures from transient and noisy artifacts. A key challenge in this process is to accurately match the corresponding topological features across the predictions in the absence of ground truth. To overcome this, we introduce a novel matching strategy that integrates spatial overlap with global structural alignment, minimizing discrepancies among predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces topological errors, resulting in more robust and accurate segmentations essential for reliable downstream analysis.

Summary:
Diffusion-LPO proposes a framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models using ranked human feedback data. By extending Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to consider listwise preferences under the Plackett-Luce model, Diffusion-LPO achieves more precise alignment of text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences. The method enforces consistency in rankings, ensuring that each sample is preferred over all lower-ranked alternatives. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO in tasks such as text-to-image generation, image editing, and personalized preference alignment. Compared to pairwise DPO baselines, Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms in terms of visual quality and preference alignment. This approach holds promise for improving the alignment between machine-generated images and human preferences, making it a valuable contribution to the field of reinforcement learning from human feedback. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has proven effectiveness for aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with human preferences. Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is widely adopted for its computational efficiency and avoidance of explicit reward modeling, its applications to diffusion models have primarily relied on pairwise preferences. The precise optimization of listwise preferences remains largely unaddressed. In practice, human feedback on image preferences often contains implicit ranked information, which conveys more precise human preferences than pairwise comparisons. In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective framework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with listwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list of images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the Plackett-Luce model. Diffusion-LPO enforces consistency across the entire ranking by encouraging each sample to be preferred over all of its lower-ranked alternatives. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of Diffusion-LPO across various tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, and personalized preference alignment. Diffusion-LPO consistently outperforms pairwise DPO baselines on visual quality and preference alignment.

Summary:
Bridge is a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that combines visual understanding and generation using a Mixture-of-Transformers architecture. It introduces a semantic-to-pixel discrete representation to enhance visual generation fidelity with minimal sequence length increase. The model achieves strong language alignment and precise visual detail description. Experimental results on various multimodal benchmarks show that Bridge outperforms existing unified MLLMs in both understanding and generation tasks while requiring less training data and time. The model addresses the challenges of combining continuous embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives and maintaining the autoregressive paradigm. <div>
arXiv:2510.01546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time compared to prior unified MLLMs.

Summary:<br />
- Oral cancer is a prevalent and deadly disease, especially in areas with limited healthcare access.
- Deep learning models traditionally struggle with overfitting and confidence issues, requiring large datasets.
- A hybrid model combining CNN with Bayesian deep learning shows promise in oral cancer classification with small training sets.
- The model achieves high accuracy on diverse test datasets, demonstrating superior generalizability compared to traditional CNNs.
- Bayesian inference improves model reliability and generalizability in data-scarce environments, enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.01547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oral cancer ranks among the most prevalent cancers globally, with a particularly high mortality rate in regions lacking adequate healthcare access. Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94% for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving model reliability and generalizability.

Summary:
CADTrans is a novel approach for source-free domain adaptation that addresses the limitations of existing methods by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency. By introducing an assistant domain module, CADTrans can obtain diverse representations and differentiate between easy and hard samples. Multiple consistent strategies are employed to obtain invariable features, and a conditional multi-kernel max mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy is used to align hard samples with corresponding easy samples. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing methods. The code for CADTrans is available for further experimentation.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of adapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly. However, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic invariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily focus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely resemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain with the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples and influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant Domains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue by constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency. Concretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain diversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions, which addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing diversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature representations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be used to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples to the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max mean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same category and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted on various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and DomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our proposed approaches.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal large language models, Visual interpretation, Blind and Low Vision users, Context-aware descriptions, VizWiz-LF dataset

Summary:
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been utilized in visual interpretation applications for Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users due to their accuracy and ability to provide detailed descriptions. However, these applications often give lengthy descriptions that may not be relevant to the specific information sought by users. To address this issue, a system was developed that leverages historical BLV users' questions to guide MLLMs in generating contextually-relevant descriptions. The system uses past visual contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and associated questions to enhance the relevance of descriptions. Evaluation by human labelers showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users' questions in 76.1% of cases and were preferred in 54.4% of comparisons. This approach aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of visual interpretation applications for BLV users. 

<br /><br />Summary: Multimodal large language models are integrated into visual interpretation applications for Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users, but often provide irrelevant, lengthy descriptions. To address this, a system was developed that utilizes historical BLV users' questions to guide the generation of context-aware descriptions from MLLMs. Evaluation results show that context-aware descriptions were able to anticipate and answer users' questions in the majority of cases and were preferred over context-free descriptions. This approach aims to improve the user experience and efficiency of visual interpretation applications for BLV users. <div>

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been integrated into visual interpretation applications to support Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users because of their accuracy and ability to provide rich, human-like interpretations. However, these applications often default to comprehensive, lengthy descriptions regardless of context. This leads to inefficient exchanges, as users must go through irrelevant details rather than receiving the specific information they are likely to seek. To deliver more contextually-relevant information, we developed a system that draws on historical BLV users questions. When given an image, our system identifies similar past visual contexts from the VizWiz-LF dataset and uses the associated questions to guide the MLLM generate descriptions more relevant to BLV users. An evaluation with three human labelers who revised 92 context-aware and context-free descriptions showed that context-aware descriptions anticipated and answered users' questions in 76.1% of cases (70 out of 92) and were preferred in 54.4% of comparisons (50 out of 92). Our paper reviews, and data analysis are publicly available in a Github repository at https://github.com/rgonzalezp/guiding-multimodal-large-language-models-with-blind-and-low-vision-people-visual-questions .

<div> Keywords: Imaging inverse problems, Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space, regularization, reconstruction fidelity, deep learning.

Summary: 
The paper introduces a novel regularization method called Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space (NPN) for imaging inverse problems. Unlike traditional handcrafted regularizers or learned models, NPN focuses on the structure of the sensing matrix's null-space to constrain the solution space. This approach offers interpretability by capturing information orthogonal to the signal components that are blind to the sensing process. NPN is also flexible and adaptable to various inverse problems, enhancing reconstruction fidelity in tasks such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging. The theoretical guarantees provided by NPN ensure convergence and reconstruction accuracy when integrated with plug-and-play methods. Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate the effectiveness of NPN in improving reconstruction outcomes with various imaging inverse problems and deep learning techniques such as unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity, prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work, we propose \textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems, compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods. Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods, unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.

Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making, this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation in genomic medicine.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models aim to unify perception, language understanding, and action generation, offering strong cross-task and cross-scene generalization with broad impact on embodied AI. However, current VLA models often lack explicit step-by-step reasoning, instead emitting final actions without considering affordance constraints or geometric relations. Their post-training pipelines also rarely reinforce reasoning quality, relying primarily on supervised fine-tuning with weak reward design. To address these challenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and execution. Specifically, we design an RLVR-based post-training strategy with verifiable rewards for region alignment, trajectory consistency, and output formatting, thereby strengthening reasoning robustness and execution accuracy. Moreover, we develop VLA-CoT-13K, a high-quality dataset that provides chain-of-thought supervision explicitly aligned with affordance and trajectory annotations. Furthermore, extensive evaluations on in-domain, out-of-domain, simulation, and real-robot platforms demonstrate that VLA-R1 achieves superior generalization and real-world performance compared to prior VLA methods. We plan to release the model, code, and dataset following the publication of this work. Code: https://github.com/GigaAI-research/VLA-R1. Website: https://gigaai-research.github.io/VLA-R1.

Summary:<br />
- The study addresses the issue of defocus blur in macrophotography, hindering clear imaging and high-quality 3D reconstruction.
- Traditional methods for image deblurring require numerous images and annotations, lacking a multi-view 3D reconstruction technique for macrophotography.
- A joint deblurring and 3D reconstruction method is proposed, optimizing the clear 3D model and defocus blur kernel of each pixel from multi-view blurry images.
- The framework employs differentiable rendering for self-supervised optimization of the 3D model and blur kernel.
- Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve high-quality image deblurring and recover a high-fidelity 3D appearance with minimal multi-view images. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macro lens has the advantages of high resolution and large magnification, and 3D modeling of small and detailed objects can provide richer information. However, defocus blur in macrophotography is a long-standing problem that heavily hinders the clear imaging of the captured objects and high-quality 3D reconstruction of them. Traditional image deblurring methods require a large number of images and annotations, and there is currently no multi-view 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. In this work, we propose a joint deblurring and 3D reconstruction method for macrophotography. Starting from multi-view blurry images captured, we jointly optimize the clear 3D model of the object and the defocus blur kernel of each pixel. The entire framework adopts a differentiable rendering method to self-supervise the optimization of the 3D model and the defocus blur kernel. Extensive experiments show that from a small number of multi-view images, our proposed method can not only achieve high-quality image deblurring but also recover high-fidelity 3D appearance.

Summary:  
FideDiff introduces a single-step diffusion model, enhancing image motion deblurring by aligning timesteps for temporal consistency. The model reformulates deblurring as a diffusion-like process, improving fidelity while addressing long inference times. By incorporating Kernel ControlNet for kernel estimation and adaptive timestep prediction, FideDiff outperforms previous diffusion-based methods and competes with other state-of-the-art models on full-reference metrics. This novel approach offers a promising direction for utilizing pre-trained diffusion models in high-fidelity image restoration tasks and sets a robust baseline for further industrial applications. The dataset and code for FideDiff are publicly available on GitHub, providing a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field.  
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image motion deblurring, driven by CNNs and transformers, have made significant progress. Large-scale pre-trained diffusion models, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for high-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger generative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However, challenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still limit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce FideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity deblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where each timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a consistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By reconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns temporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance model performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation and introducing adaptive timestep prediction. Our model achieves superior performance on full-reference metrics, surpassing previous diffusion-based methods and matching the performance of other state-of-the-art models. FideDiff offers a new direction for applying pre-trained diffusion models to high-fidelity image restoration tasks, establishing a robust baseline for further advancing diffusion models in real-world industrial applications.

Summary:
A new dataset of Bronze Inscriptions (BI) images with annotated characters is introduced to tackle the challenges of automatic BI recognition. A two-stage detection-recognition pipeline is developed to localize inscriptions and transcribe characters, with the addition of LadderMoE to handle domain variability and rare classes. Experimental results show significant improvement in recognition accuracy compared to existing methods, across various categories and acquisition modalities. This advancement paves the way for more effective bronze inscription recognition and enables further archaeological analysis. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial stage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for archaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition remains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability across photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed character distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI dataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters spanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation. Building on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition pipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual characters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the pipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with ladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger robustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page recognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy across head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities. These results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition and downstream archaeological analysis.

<div> Keywords: UDA pipelines, visual reprogramming, domain adaptation, parameter-efficient, textural bias

Summary: 
VirDA is a new approach for domain adaptation that utilizes domain-specific textural biases without the need to fine-tune the full backbone. By adding a visual reprogramming layer to the backbone, VirDA optimizes the visual prompts to adapt the style of input images to a target domain. This method allows for the reuse of well-trained backbone parameters across different domains, reducing the number of trainable parameters and storage memory required. Evaluations on the Office-31 dataset show that VirDA achieves a mean accuracy of 92.8% with only 1.5M trainable parameters, outperforming existing methods like PDA, CDTrans, and FixBi while using significantly fewer parameters. Compared to current strong methods like PMTrans and TVT, VirDA maintains competitive accuracy while utilizing only a fraction of their parameters. VirDA demonstrates the potential for efficient and effective domain adaptation in computer vision tasks. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing UDA pipelines fine-tune already well-trained backbone parameters for every new source-and-target pair, resulting in the number of training parameters and storage memory growing linearly with each new pair, and also preventing the reuse of these well-trained backbone parameters.
  Inspired by recent implications that existing backbones have textural biases, we propose making use of domain-specific textural bias for domain adaptation via visual reprogramming, namely VirDA.Instead of fine-tuning the full backbone, VirDA prepends a domain-specific visual reprogramming layer to the backbone. This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias to the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize these visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that optimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when domain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require modifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused across different domains.
  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M trainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art parameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its parameters. Compared with full-backbone fine-tuning, VirDA outperforms CDTrans and FixBi by +0.2% and +1.4%, respectively, while requiring only 1.7% and 2.8% of their trainable parameters. Relative to the strongest current methods (PMTrans and TVT), VirDA uses ~1.7% of their parameters and trades off only 2.2% and 1.1% accuracy, respectively.

Summary: 
Facial expression analysis is crucial for understanding human behavior, but existing systems like FACS have limitations. The proposed Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE) method uses a Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE) to learn a dictionary of facial expressions from 3D mesh sequences. By leveraging a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) to extract identity-invariant features, DFE can capture precise facial behaviors. The DFE approach outperforms FACS and other encoding methods in psychological tasks such as stress detection, personality prediction, and depression detection. Using a Bag-of-Words model on learned tokens, DFE surpasses traditional pipelines and image/video representation learning models like Masked Autoencoders. The versatility and effectiveness of DFE indicate its potential as a scalable alternative to FACS for applications in psychological and affective computing.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial expression analysis is central to understanding human behavior, yet existing coding systems such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) are constrained by limited coverage and costly manual annotation. In this work, we introduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven alternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from 3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant expression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively disentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode these features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a shared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial deformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures more precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives. We evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level psychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression detection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned tokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and strong image and video representation learning models such as Masked Autoencoders. Further analysis reveals that our representation covers a wider variety of facial displays, highlighting its potential as a scalable and effective alternative to FACS for psychological and affective computing applications.

Abstract: Non-rigid structure-from-motion (NRSfM), a promising technique for addressing the mapping challenges in monocular visual deformable simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), has attracted growing attention. We introduce a novel method, called Con-NRSfM, for NRSfM under conformal deformations, encompassing isometric deformations as a subset. Our approach performs point-wise reconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based framework. Unlike existing methods that rely on strict assumptions, such as locally planar surfaces or locally linear deformations, and fail to recover the conformal scale, our method eliminates these constraints and accurately computes the local conformal scale. Additionally, our framework decouples constraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other approaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity of the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative optimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework, utilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D point clouds with texture. Simulation and experimental results using both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and robustness. The code for the proposed method will be made publicly available on the project website: https://sites.google.com/view/con-nrsfm.

<div> Keywords: robust reconstruction, image inconsistencies, neural 3D scene representations, UniVerse, video diffusion model

Summary:
Robust reconstruction is a challenging task involving reconstructing a 3D scene from inconsistent multi-view images. Previous methods integrated image degradation modeling into neural 3D scene representations, relying heavily on dense observations for parameter optimization. To simplify the optimization process, a new approach called UniVerse decouples robust reconstruction into restoration and reconstruction subtasks. This framework utilizes a video diffusion model, converting inconsistent images into initial videos, restoring them into consistent images, and reconstructing the 3D scenes. The diffusion model learns a general scene prior from large-scale data, enhancing its applicability to diverse image inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets showcase the method's strong generalization capability and superior performance in robust reconstruction. Additionally, UniVerse allows for controlling the style of the reconstructed 3D scene. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of reconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some recent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and perform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D scene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations for robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to decouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and reconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this end, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based on a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent images into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion model to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D scenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view degradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from large-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image inconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of our method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style of the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page: https://jin-cao-tma.github.io/UniVerse.github.io/

<div> Keywords: template matching, geometric pose estimation, deep learning, dynamic convolution, industrial inspection<br />
<br />
Summary: <br />
This article introduces a novel framework for template matching in industrial inspection and component alignment tasks. The proposed approach integrates joint localization and geometric regression to estimate a target's position, rotation angle, and scaling under complex backgrounds efficiently. A Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution Module (TDCM) is used to guide generalizable matching by dynamically injecting template features at inference. The lightweight network design, incorporating depthwise separable convolutions and pixel shuffle, enables high precision and fast inference. Geometric-annotation-free training is achieved through a rotation-shear-based augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight refinement module further enhances angle and scale precision through local optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the model's strong robustness in various scenarios, making it well-suited for real-time industrial applications. <div>

Abstract: In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching requires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state (rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream operations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and scales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile, most deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without explicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end framework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and geometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and independent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic Convolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to guide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise separable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable geometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based augmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight refinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local optimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms inference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong robustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly suitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications.

<br />
Summary: 
The article introduces a novel framework for adaptive pixel reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to enhance their performance on tasks requiring precise understanding of fine-grained visual elements. By dynamically determining necessary pixel-level operations based on input queries, the proposed framework improves efficiency and reduces distraction from irrelevant visual details. The framework involves operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence, followed by a rollout-guided reinforcement learning approach that allows the VLM to decide when to use pixel operations based on query difficulty. Experimental results on various multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the model achieves superior performance with significantly reduced unnecessary visual operations. Specifically, the model achieves 73.4% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while minimizing tool usage by 66.5% compared to existing methods. <div>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they frequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of fine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during image encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model achieves 73.4\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of only 20.1\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by 66.5\% compared to the previous methods.

Summary: <br />
This paper introduces a new framework called augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) to address fairness and reliability concerns in chest radiograph (CXR) interpretation using deep learning models. The ASRS framework leverages clinically plausible rotations and measures embedding shifts to identify error-prone CXR cases. By stratifying samples based on sensitivity scores, ASRS helps to highlight highly sensitive cases that exhibit lower recall despite high AUROC and confidence levels. This approach provides a label-free method for selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in medical AI applications. ASRS complements existing error detection methods by focusing on within-distribution errors, which are often overlooked. By integrating image augmentation and sensitivity analysis, ASRS offers a promising strategy for enhancing the performance and reliability of deep learning models in CXR interpretation. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve strong performance in chest radiograph (CXR) interpretation, yet fairness and reliability concerns persist. Models often show uneven accuracy across patient subgroups, leading to hidden failures not reflected in aggregate metrics. Existing error detection approaches -- based on confidence calibration or out-of-distribution (OOD) detection -- struggle with subtle within-distribution errors, while image- and representation-level consistency-based methods remain underexplored in medical imaging. We propose an augmentation-sensitivity risk scoring (ASRS) framework to identify error-prone CXR cases. ASRS applies clinically plausible rotations ($\pm 15^\circ$/$\pm 30^\circ$) and measures embedding shifts with the RAD-DINO encoder. Sensitivity scores stratify samples into stability quartiles, where highly sensitive cases show substantially lower recall ($-0.2$ to $-0.3$) despite high AUROC and confidence. ASRS provides a label-free means for selective prediction and clinician review, improving fairness and safety in medical AI.

Summary:<br />
The paper introduces FreeViS, a training-free video stylization framework that addresses the challenges of temporal consistency and style richness. By integrating multiple stylized references into a pretrained image-to-video model, FreeViS effectively reduces propagation errors without introducing flickers or stutters. It also utilizes high-frequency compensation and flow-based motion cues to constrain content layout and preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through evaluations, FreeViS demonstrates higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal consistency compared to recent baselines, gaining strong human preference. This training-free pipeline offers a practical and cost-effective solution for generating high-quality, temporally coherent stylized videos. <div>
arXiv:2510.01686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a challenging problem. Na\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts temporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a dedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free video stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style details and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized references to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating the propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers and stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to constrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues to preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive evaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal consistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human preference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution for high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization.

- MedQ-Bench includes tasks for assessing low-level perceptual capability and reasoning ability on medical images across different modalities and quality attributes.<br />
- Evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs shows preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills, indicating the need for targeted optimization in medical IQA.<br />

- Comparison of model judgments with radiologists demonstrates the current insufficient accuracy of MLLMs for reliable clinical use. <br /> <div>
arXiv:2510.01691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical Image Quality Assessment (IQA) serves as the first-mile safety gate for clinical AI, yet existing approaches remain constrained by scalar, score-based metrics and fail to reflect the descriptive, human-like reasoning process central to expert evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce MedQ-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that establishes a perception-reasoning paradigm for language-based evaluation of medical image quality with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MedQ-Bench defines two complementary tasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via human-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2) MedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks, aligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The benchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes, totaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering diverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with simulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated images. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging protocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further conduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement with radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates that models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills, with insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight the need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that MedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential of MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces InstaFormer, a network designed for holistic order prediction in visual models. It tackles the challenge of understanding instance-wise geometries in controlled settings, providing full occlusion and depth orderings for all instances in a scene in a single forward pass based solely on an input RGB image. InstaFormer leverages interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors to semantically represent objects and provide complementary information. By addressing limitations such as expensive input formats and high inference costs, InstaFormer offers a more efficient solution for understanding geometries in visual models. The approach is comprehensively benchmarked and ablated to showcase its effectiveness, with open-source code and models available for further exploration. <div>

Abstract: Even in controlled settings, understanding instance-wise geometries is a challenging task for a wide range of visual models. Although specialized systems exist, modern arts rely on expensive input formats (category labels, binary segmentation masks) and inference costs (a quadratic amount of forward passes). We mitigate these limitations by proposing InstaFormer, a network capable of holistic order prediction. That is, solely given an input RGB image, InstaFormer returns the full occlusion and depth orderings for all the instances in the scene in a single forward pass. At its core, InstaFormer relies on interactions between object queries and latent mask descriptors that semantically represent the same objects while carrying complementary information. We comprehensively benchmark and ablate our approach to highlight its effectiveness. Our code and models are open-source and available at this URL: https://github.com/SNU-VGILab/InstaOrder.

The model incorporates reinforcement learning to optimize stylization and accelerate convergence. Trained on Microsoft COCO and WikiArt datasets, PyramidStyler achieves significant reductions in content and style loss after 4000 epochs, with real-time inference.

Abstract: Neural Style Transfer (NST) has evolved from Gatys et al.'s (2015) CNN-based algorithm, enabling AI-driven artistic image synthesis. However, existing CNN and transformer-based models struggle to scale efficiently to complex styles and high-resolution inputs. We introduce PyramidStyler, a transformer framework with Pyramidal Positional Encoding (PPE): a hierarchical, multi-scale encoding that captures both local details and global context while reducing computational load. We further incorporate reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize stylization, accelerating convergence. Trained on Microsoft COCO and WikiArt, PyramidStyler reduces content loss by 62.6% (to 2.07) and style loss by 57.4% (to 0.86) after 4000 epochs--achieving 1.39 s inference--and yields further improvements (content 2.03; style 0.75) with minimal speed penalty (1.40 s) when using RL. These results demonstrate real-time, high-quality artistic rendering, with broad applications in media and design.

Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient representation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However, scaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains difficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by partitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i) partitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits do not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines fail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model and incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel Load-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers the large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning method that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based strategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational load -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and selective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on large-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves up to $2\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to scenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.

It scales well with video length, maintains computational efficiency, and prevents error accumulation. Direct Forcing is introduced as an efficient strategy to improve training-inference alignment and reduce error propagation during inference. These two contributions enhance context consistency and reliability in autoregressive video models, making them more practical for generating long-form videos. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-form video generation presents a dual challenge: models must capture long-range dependencies while preventing the error accumulation inherent in autoregressive decoding. To address these challenges, we make two contributions. First, for dynamic context modeling, we propose MemoryPack, a learnable context-retrieval mechanism that leverages both textual and image information as global guidance to jointly model short- and long-term dependencies, achieving minute-level temporal consistency. This design scales gracefully with video length, preserves computational efficiency, and maintains linear complexity. Second, to mitigate error accumulation, we introduce Direct Forcing, an efficient single-step approximating strategy that improves training-inference alignment and thereby curtails error propagation during inference. Together, MemoryPack and Direct Forcing substantially enhance the context consistency and reliability of long-form video generation, advancing the practical usability of autoregressive video models.

Summary: <br />
This study focuses on confidence calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors in autonomous systems. The authors emphasize the importance of considering the calibration of the entire predictive confidence distribution across all classes, introducing a metric that captures the calibration of both dominant and secondary class predictions. They propose two regularizing loss terms to train for calibration of either the dominant prediction or the full prediction vector. Evaluating various methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet, and DSVT-Pillar, they find that combining their proposed loss term with isotonic regression yields the best calibration for CenterPoint and PillarNet in terms of both dominant and secondary class predictions. However, they observe that DSVT-Pillar cannot be simultaneously calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same approach. <div>

Abstract: In autonomous systems, precise object detection and uncertainty estimation are critical for self-aware and safe operation. This work addresses confidence calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same method.

DiffPS introduces a new framework for person search that utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model to improve person localization and re-identification in scene images. The framework resolves conflicts between detection and re-identification tasks and includes specialized modules like Diffusion-Guided Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for accurate localization, Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to reduce shape bias, and Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) for leveraging text-aligned diffusion features. By leveraging diffusion priors, DiffPS achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets like CUHK-SYSU and PRW. The framework showcases enhanced person localization, shape bias mitigation, and efficient feature aggregation, setting a new benchmark for person search tasks. Improved performance on challenging datasets validates the effectiveness of DiffPS in capturing complex spatial context and fine-grained identity cues necessary for accurate person search.<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Person search aims to jointly perform person detection and re-identification by localizing and identifying a query person within a gallery of uncropped scene images. Existing methods predominantly utilize ImageNet pre-trained backbones, which may be suboptimal for capturing the complex spatial context and fine-grained identity cues necessary for person search. Moreover, they rely on a shared backbone feature for both person detection and re-identification, leading to suboptimal features due to conflicting optimization objectives. In this paper, we propose DiffPS (Diffusion Prior Knowledge for Person Search), a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained diffusion model while eliminating the optimization conflict between two sub-tasks. We analyze key properties of diffusion priors and propose three specialized modules: (i) Diffusion-Guided Region Proposal Network (DGRPN) for enhanced person localization, (ii) Multi-Scale Frequency Refinement Network (MSFRN) to mitigate shape bias, and (iii) Semantic-Adaptive Feature Aggregation Network (SFAN) to leverage text-aligned diffusion features. DiffPS sets a new state-of-the-art on CUHK-SYSU and PRW.

Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU) integrates flow matching into hyperspectral imaging (HSI) reconstruction through a deep unfolding framework. By incorporating a mean velocity loss to ensure global consistency of the flow, FMU provides a more robust and accurate reconstruction of three-dimensional HSI data, overcoming the limitations of existing approaches. This hybrid design leverages the interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of flow matching, resulting in improved efficiency in reconstructing fine spectral details. Extensive experiments on simulated and real datasets demonstrate that FMU outperforms current methods in reconstruction quality. The code and models for FMU are available on GitHub for further exploration and application in HSI research. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.01912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides rich spatial-spectral information but remains costly to acquire due to hardware limitations and the difficulty of reconstructing three-dimensional data from compressed measurements. Although compressive sensing systems such as CASSI improve efficiency, accurate reconstruction is still challenged by severe degradation and loss of fine spectral details. We propose the Flow-Matching-guided Unfolding network (FMU), which, to our knowledge, is the first to integrate flow matching into HSI reconstruction by embedding its generative prior within a deep unfolding framework. To further strengthen the learned dynamics, we introduce a mean velocity loss that enforces global consistency of the flow, leading to a more robust and accurate reconstruction. This hybrid design leverages the interpretability of optimization-based methods and the generative capacity of flow matching. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real datasets show that FMU significantly outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction quality.

Abstract: Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated (v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation. The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.

<div> Few-shot anomaly detection, industrial safety inspection, large-scale pre-training, visual encoders, FoundAD <br />
<br />
Summary: 
The article discusses the challenges of few-shot anomaly detection in industrial safety inspections due to limited samples and category-agnostic conditions. It introduces FoundAD, a few-shot anomaly detector that utilizes the anomaly amount in images to design a nonlinear projection operator for characterizing out-of-distribution regions. The operator helps in differentiating normal and abnormal features by learning embeddings and identifying anomalies in images. FoundAD achieves competitive performance in multi-class detection with fewer parameters than prior methods. It also highlights the importance of large-scale pre-training of visual encoders in learning the general distribution of normal images. Experimental evaluations with various encoders, including DINOv3, support the effectiveness of FoundAD in advancing the field of few-shot anomaly detection. <div>

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection streamlines and simplifies industrial safety inspection. However, limited samples make accurate differentiation between normal and abnormal features challenging, and even more so under category-agnostic conditions. Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual encoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to learn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly detection.

Summary: 
ClustViT is a novel approach that enhances Vision Transformers for semantic segmentation tasks in real-world robotic systems.

This allows for more efficient processing and faster inference, with up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x increased speed on various datasets. The Regenerator module further refines fine details for downstream tasks, leading to comparable segmentation accuracy. By expanding upon the ViT backbone, ClustViT improves the practical applicability of Vision Transformers for dense prediction tasks.

Abstract: Vision Transformers can achieve high accuracy and strong generalization across various contexts, but their practical applicability on real-world robotic systems is limited due to their quadratic attention complexity. Recent works have focused on dynamically merging tokens according to the image complexity. Token merging works well for classification but is less suited to dense prediction. We propose ClustViT, where we expand upon the Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone and address semantic segmentation. Within our architecture, a trainable Cluster module merges similar tokens along the network guided by pseudo-clusters from segmentation masks. Subsequently, a Regenerator module restores fine details for downstream heads. Our approach achieves up to 2.18x fewer GFLOPs and 1.64x faster inference on three different datasets, with comparable segmentation accuracy. Our code and models will be made publicly available.

<div> Keywords: Multimodal large language models, Patch-as-Decodable Token, Visual Reference Tokens, visual perception tasks, state-of-the-art performance

Summary:
Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT) introduces a unified paradigm for multimodal large language models to directly generate textual and visual outputs for various vision tasks. It incorporates Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs) derived from visual patch embeddings to improve localization and differentiation among objects. The lightweight decoder in PaDT transforms model outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically expands the embedding table, enhancing performance. A tailored training strategy includes supervised fine-tuning with random VRT selection and a per-token cross-entropy loss for robust training. Empirical studies across visual perception tasks demonstrate PaDT consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, surpassing larger MLLM models. The code for PaDT is available for further exploration and implementation at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

arXiv:2510.01954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years. However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect representations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which limits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a unified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and diverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs), derived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly with LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's outputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior methods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically expands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation among similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by randomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust per-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual perception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM models. The code is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/PaDT.

Summary: 
The article addresses the trust deficit in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce by introducing the Trust Pyramid model based on dual-source verification. It identifies quality as the key factor in building trust. The study highlights the limitations of traditional grading standards in agriculture and introduces the concept of the "impossible triangle" consisting of biological characteristics, timeliness, and economic viability. To quantify this trade-off, the Triangular Trust Index (TTI) is proposed.

Abstract: The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the inability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of product quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through 'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality is the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in agricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics, timeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional absolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose the 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from 'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases', designing the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports trustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through multi-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the Bio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness Optimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization Engine for cost control. Additionally, the "Pre-Mapping Mechanism" encodes process data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information. Experiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than baseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the framework's balancing capability in addressing the "impossible triangle". This research provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building a trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from algorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.

Summary: <br />
The article introduces 4DGS-Craft, a framework for 4D Gaussian Splatting editing that addresses challenges related to consistency and user interaction. The framework incorporates a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model that ensures view and temporal consistency by utilizing 4D VGGT geometry features. It also includes a multi-view grid module to refine input images and optimize the underlying 4D scene. A novel Gaussian selection mechanism maintains consistency in non-edited regions by focusing on Gaussians within edited areas. For user interaction, an LLM-based module interprets user intent using an instruction template and reasoning with an LLM, enabling complex instructions to be decomposed into atomic operations. Overall, 4DGS-Craft improves the consistency and controllability of 4D scene editing, providing a more effective and user-friendly editing experience. <div>
arXiv:2510.01991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) editing still face challenges with view, temporal, and non-editing region consistency, as well as with handling complex text instructions. To address these issues, we propose 4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first introduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal consistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from the initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures during editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module that enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while jointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the consistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism, which identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions. Beyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective 4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent understanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic editing operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our framework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a logical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user commands and further enhance editing performance. Compared to related works, our approach enables more consistent and controllable 4D scene editing. Our code will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution counterparts, but the computational complexity of deep learning-based methods often hinders practical deployment. CAMixer is the pioneering work to integrate the advantages of existing lightweight SR methods and proposes a content-aware mixer to route token mixers of varied complexities according to the difficulty of content recovery. However, several limitations remain, such as poor adaptability, coarse-grained masking and spatial inflexibility, among others. We propose Pure-Pass (PP), a pixel-level masking mechanism that identifies pure pixels and exempts them from expensive computations. PP utilizes fixed color center points to classify pixels into distinct categories, enabling fine-grained, spatially flexible masking while maintaining adaptive flexibility. Integrated into the state-of-the-art ATD-light model, PP-ATD-light achieves superior SR performance with minimal overhead, outperforming CAMixer-ATD-light in reconstruction quality and parameter efficiency when saving a similar amount of computation.

Summary: This study utilized OpenAI GPT-4o to automatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs. A Self-correction Loop with Structured Output (SLSO) framework was implemented to improve accuracy. A 10-step process was used for 22 cases of jaw cysts, with iterative regeneration for inconsistencies. The SLSO framework showed improvements in output accuracy for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption. Consistently structured output was achieved after up to five regenerations.

Abstract: In this study, we utilized the multimodal capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4o to automatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs. To improve accuracy, we constructed a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output (SLSO) framework and verified its effectiveness. A 10-step process was implemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis, structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking, iterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding generation with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A comparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure, borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures, and tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved output accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the successful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to five regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because of the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative finding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number identification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive lesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is required to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding generation system.

Abstract: This work proposed a 3D autoencoder architecture, named LiLa-Net, which encodes efficient features from real traffic environments, employing only the LiDAR's point clouds. For this purpose, we have real semi-autonomous vehicle, equipped with Velodyne LiDAR.

Key changes include reducing the number of encoder layers and simplifying the skip connections, while still producing an efficient and representative latent space which allows to accurately reconstruct the original point cloud. Furthermore, an effective balance has been achieved between the information carried by the skip connections and the latent encoding, leading to improved reconstruction quality without compromising performance. Finally, the model demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, successfully reconstructing objects unrelated to the original traffic environment.

Summary:
kabr-tools is introduced as an open-source package for automated multi-species behavioral monitoring, utilizing drone-based video and machine learning systems. The framework allows for the extraction of various behavioral, social, and spatial metrics from wildlife footage, providing insights into time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to traditional ground-based methods, drone-based observations offer improved behavioral granularity, capturing more transitions with higher accuracy. Three case studies validate the effectiveness of kabr-tools, analyzing 969 behavioral sequences and revealing findings such as the impact of herd size on vigilance in Plains and Grevy's zebras, behavioral inertia, and spatial segregation within mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at scale, kabr-tools serves as a valuable tool for ecosystem-wide studies, contributing to conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable approaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral patterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection, tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics, including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods, drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity, reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies, analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras, vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.

arXiv:2510.02034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce GaussianMorphing, a novel framework for semantic-aware 3D shape and texture morphing from multi-view images. Previous approaches usually rely on point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured data. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling. The core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors 3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent transformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware constraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic correspondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains structural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This integrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence throughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our proposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior 2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by 26.2%.

<title>Zero-shot Human Pose Estimation using Diffusion-based Inverse solvers</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02043</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.02043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction is conditioned on both  measurements from the sensors. Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users, primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains the sparse on-body measurements.

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures. Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries.
  In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor details.
  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines. Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor segmentation.

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl in France before the 1970s is hindered by the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data. This study bridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract urban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which produces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this pivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to handle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The first pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that identifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data augmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output of the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces false positives. Deployed on a high-performance computing cluster, our method processes 941 high-resolution tiles covering the entirety of metropolitan France. The final mosaic achieves an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively capturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming common artifacts like labels and contour lines. We openly release the code, training datasets, and the resulting nationwide urban raster to support future research in long-term urbanization dynamics.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) models such as SAM2 offer promising zero-shot tracking capabilities for surgical videos using minimal user input. Among the available input types, point-based tracking offers an efficient and low-cost alternative, yet its reliability and failure cases in complex surgical environments are not well understood. In this work, we systematically analyze the failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy videos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and L-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with segmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is competitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical targets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure. Through qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking outcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and placing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.

Abstract: Federeated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution for Semantic Segmentation (SS) tasks to adapt to new domains, but faces significant challenges from these domain shifts, particularly when client data is unlabeled. However, most existing FL methods unrealistically assume access to labeled data on remote clients or fail to leverage the power of modern Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Here, we propose a novel and challenging task, FFREEDG, in which a model is pretrained on a server's labeled source dataset and subsequently trained across clients using only their unlabeled data, without ever re-accessing the source. To solve FFREEDG, we propose FRIEREN, a framework that leverages the knowledge of a VFM by integrating vision and language modalities. Our approach employs a Vision-Language decoder guided by CLIP-based text embeddings to improve semantic disambiguation and uses a weak-to-strong consistency learning strategy for robust local training on pseudo-labels. Our experiments on synthetic-to-real and clear-to-adverse-weather benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively tackles this new task, achieving competitive performance against established domain generalization and adaptation methods and setting a strong baseline for future research.

Abstract: Prompting has emerged as a practical way to adapt frozen vision-language models (VLMs) for video anomaly detection (VAD). Yet, existing prompts are often overly abstract, overlooking the fine-grained human-object interactions or action semantics that define complex anomalies in surveillance videos. We propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for explainable video anomaly detection.

Abstract: Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to 3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with 3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the 2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency. Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about 1.5% of the training data. Our codes and checkpoints are available at [https://github.com/tj12323/GeoPurify](https://github.com/tj12323/GeoPurify).

Abstract: Accurate livestock identification is a cornerstone of modern farming: it supports health monitoring, breeding programs, and productivity tracking. However, common pig identification methods, such as ear tags and microchips, are often unreliable, costly, target pure breeds, and thus impractical for small-scale farmers. To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric identification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein patterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed pigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a standard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision pipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and spatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then classified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM) achieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision across mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to classification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating feasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile physical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides farmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification. More broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein biometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to extend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural communities.

Abstract: Density map estimation can be used to estimate object counts in dense and occluded scenes where discrete counting-by-detection methods fail. We propose a multicategory counting framework that leverages a Twins pyramid vision-transformer backbone and a specialised multi-class counting head built on a state-of-the-art multiscale decoding approach. A two-task design adds a segmentation-based Category Focus Module, suppressing inter-category cross-talk at training time. Training and evaluation on the VisDrone and iSAID benchmarks demonstrates superior performance versus prior multicategory crowd-counting approaches (33%, 43% and 64% reduction to MAE), and the comparison with YOLOv11 underscores the necessity of crowd counting methods in dense scenes. The method's regional loss opens up multi-class crowd counting to new domains, demonstrated through the application to a biodiversity monitoring dataset, highlighting its capacity to inform conservation efforts and enable scalable ecological insights.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications, including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as action and audio-aligned generation.

<title>RewardMap: Tackling Sparse Rewards in Fine-grained Visual Reasoning via Multi-Stage Reinforcement Learning</title>

Abstract: Fine-grained visual reasoning remains a core challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap by showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in structured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear practical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover, models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6 benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding and reasoning capabilities.

<title>DragFlow: Unleashing DiT Priors with Region Based Supervision for Drag Editing</title>
<link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02253</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.02253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion, are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly: unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm, where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities. For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench) featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image editing. Code and datasets will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the "needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips, which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and 10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world video understanding applications.

<title>Paving the Way Towards Kinematic Assessment Using Monocular Video: A Preclinical Benchmark of State-of-the-Art Deep-Learning-Based 3D Human Pose Estimators Against Inertial Sensors in Daily Living Activities</title>

Abstract: Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for capturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories. Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical benchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with inertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a total of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both commodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks (MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17 keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\deg \pm 4.80\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\deg \pm 4.18\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \pm 0.15$) and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \pm 0.28$). The results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for telehealth and remote patient monitoring.

Abstract: Reconstructing visual information from brain activity via computer vision technology provides an intuitive understanding of visual neural mechanisms. Despite progress in decoding fMRI data with generative models, achieving accurate cross-subject reconstruction of visual stimuli remains challenging and computationally demanding. This difficulty arises from inter-subject variability in neural representations and the brain's abstract encoding of core semantic features in complex visual inputs. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroSwift, which integrates complementary adapters via diffusion: AutoKL for low-level features and CLIP for semantics. NeuroSwift's CLIP Adapter is trained on Stable Diffusion generated images paired with COCO captions to emulate higher visual cortex encoding. For cross-subject generalization, we pretrain on one subject and then fine-tune only 17 percent of parameters (fully connected layers) for new subjects, while freezing other components. This enables state-of-the-art performance with only one hour of training per subject on lightweight GPUs (three RTX 4090), and it outperforms existing methods.

arXiv:2510.02270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks. Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model (LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP) within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided $\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling, and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation. Our code is available at https://github.com/sathiiii/microCLIP.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI-generated videos, there is an urgent need for effective detection tools to mitigate societal risks such as misinformation and reputational harm. In addition to accurate classification, it is essential that detection models provide interpretable explanations to ensure transparency for regulators and end users. To address these challenges, we introduce VidGuard-R1, the first video authenticity detector that fine-tunes a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) using group relative policy optimization (GRPO). Our model delivers both highly accurate judgments and insightful reasoning. We curate a challenging dataset of 140k real and AI-generated videos produced by state-of-the-art generation models, carefully designing the generation process to maximize discrimination difficulty. We then fine-tune Qwen-VL using GRPO with two specialized reward models that target temporal artifacts and generation complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VidGuard-R1 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on existing benchmarks, with additional training pushing accuracy above 95%. Case studies further show that VidGuard-R1 produces precise and interpretable rationales behind its predictions. The code is publicly available at https://VidGuard-R1.github.io.

Abstract: Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos. Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to 20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency.

Abstract: Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however, current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore, KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size. Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Current video models fail as world model as they lack fine-graiend control. General-purpose household robots require real-time fine motor control to handle delicate tasks and urgent situations. In this work, we introduce fine-grained multimodal actions to capture such precise control. We consider senses of proprioception, kinesthesia, force haptics, and muscle activation. Such multimodal senses naturally enables fine-grained interactions that are difficult to simulate with text-conditioned generative models. To effectively simulate fine-grained multisensory actions, we develop a feature learning paradigm that aligns these modalities while preserving the unique information each modality provides. We further propose a regularization scheme to enhance causality of the action trajectory features in representing intricate interaction dynamics. Experiments show that incorporating multimodal senses improves simulation accuracy and reduces temporal drift. Extensive ablation studies and downstream applications demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our work.

Abstract: Video understanding in multimodal language models remains limited by context length: models often miss key transition frames and struggle to maintain coherence across long time scales. To address this, we adapt Native Sparse Attention (NSA) to video-language models. Our method, VideoNSA, adapts Qwen2.5-VL through end-to-end training on a 216K video instruction dataset. We employ a hardware-aware hybrid approach to attention, preserving dense attention for text, while employing NSA for video. Compared to token-compression and training-free sparse baselines, VideoNSA achieves improved performance on long-video understanding, temporal reasoning, and spatial benchmarks. Further ablation analysis reveals four key findings: (1) reliable scaling to 128K tokens; (2) an optimal global-local attention allocation at a fixed budget; (3) task-dependent branch usage patterns; and (4) the learnable combined sparse attention help induce dynamic attention sinks.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often fail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions than those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size. NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent artifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.

Abstract: We study the task of predicting dynamic physical properties from videos. More specifically, we consider physical properties that require temporal information to be inferred: elasticity of a bouncing object, viscosity of a flowing liquid, and dynamic friction of an object sliding on a surface. To this end, we make the following contributions: (i) We collect a new video dataset for each physical property, consisting of synthetic training and testing splits, as well as a real split for real world evaluation. (ii) We explore three ways to infer the physical property from videos: (a) an oracle method where we supply the visual cues that intrinsically reflect the property using classical computer vision techniques; (b) a simple read out mechanism using a visual prompt and trainable prompt vector for cross-attention on pre-trained video generative and self-supervised models; and (c) prompt strategies for Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). (iii) We show that video foundation models trained in a generative or self-supervised manner achieve a similar performance, though behind that of the oracle, and MLLMs are currently inferior to the other models, though their performance can be improved through suitable prompting.

Abstract: Can a model distinguish between the sound of a spoon hitting a hardwood floor versus a carpeted one? Everyday object interactions produce sounds unique to the objects involved. We introduce the sounding object detection task to evaluate a model's ability to link these sounds to the objects directly involved. Inspired by human perception, our multimodal object-aware framework learns from in-the-wild egocentric videos. To encourage an object-centric approach, we first develop an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masks of the objects involved to guide the model's focus during training towards the most informative regions of the interaction. A slot attention visual encoder is used to further enforce an object prior. We demonstrate state of the art performance on our new task along with existing multimodal action understanding tasks.

Abstract: 3D scene representation methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have significantly advanced novel view synthesis. As these methods become prevalent, addressing their vulnerabilities becomes critical. We analyze 3DGS robustness against image-level poisoning attacks and propose a novel density-guided poisoning method. Our method strategically injects Gaussian points into low-density regions identified via Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), embedding viewpoint-dependent illusory objects clearly visible from poisoned views while minimally affecting innocent views. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive noise strategy to disrupt multi-view consistency, further enhancing attack effectiveness. We propose a KDE-based evaluation protocol to assess attack difficulty systematically, enabling objective benchmarking for future research. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Project page: https://hentci.github.io/stealthattack/

<title>Optimal Control Meets Flow Matching: A Principled Route to Multi-Subject Fidelity</title>

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with multi-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity entanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical framework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling dynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through stochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as control over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic algorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base velocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight fine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal while preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior attention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion correspondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed for multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and Stable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject alignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs efficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited prompts generalize to unseen ones. We further highlight FOCUS (Flow Optimal Control for Unentangled Subjects), which achieves state-of-the-art multi-subject fidelity across models.

Abstract: Access to obstetric ultrasound is often limited in low-resource settings, particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. This work proposes a human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to assist midwives in acquiring diagnostically relevant fetal images using blind sweep protocols. The system incorporates a classification model along with a web-based platform for asynchronous specialist reviews. By identifying key frames in blind sweep studies, the AI system allows specialists to concentrate on interpretation rather than having to review entire videos. To evaluate its performance, blind sweep videos captured by a small group of soft-trained midwives using a low-cost Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) device were analyzed. The system demonstrated promising results in identifying standard fetal planes from sweeps made by non-experts. A field evaluation indicated good usability and a low cognitive workload, suggesting that it has the potential to expand access to prenatal imaging in underserved regions.

Abstract: Eye tracking has become a key technology for gaze-based interactions in Extended Reality (XR). However, conventional frame-based eye-tracking systems often fall short of XR's stringent requirements for high accuracy, low latency, and energy efficiency. Event cameras present a compelling alternative, offering ultra-high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we present JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware accelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse, high-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural network architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the traditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving computational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our proposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+ dataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of activation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization. Through software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at 400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames Per Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $\mu$J/frame. JaneEye sets a new benchmark in low-power, high-performance eye-tracking solutions suitable for integration into next-generation XR wearables.

Abstract: Audio-video generation has often relied on complex multi-stage architectures or sequential synthesis of sound and visuals. We introduce Ovi, a unified paradigm for audio-video generation that models the two modalities as a single generative process. By using blockwise cross-modal fusion of twin-DiT modules, Ovi achieves natural synchronization and removes the need for separate pipelines or post hoc alignment. To facilitate fine-grained multimodal fusion modeling, we initialize an audio tower with an architecture identical to that of a strong pretrained video model. Trained from scratch on hundreds of thousands of hours of raw audio, the audio tower learns to generate realistic sound effects, as well as speech that conveys rich speaker identity and emotion. Fusion is obtained by jointly training the identical video and audio towers via blockwise exchange of timing (via scaled-RoPE embeddings) and semantics (through bidirectional cross-attention) on a vast video corpus. Our model enables cinematic storytelling with natural speech and accurate, context-matched sound effects, producing movie-grade video clips. All the demos, code and model weights are published at https://aaxwaz.github.io/Ovi

Abstract: Deep learning-based 3-dimensional (3D) shape reconstruction from 2-dimensional (2D) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become increasingly important in medical disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and computational modeling. This review surveys the methodological landscape of 3D MRI reconstruction, focusing on 4 primary approaches: point cloud, mesh-based, shape-aware, and volumetric models. For each category, we analyze the current state-of-the-art techniques, their methodological foundation, limitations, and applications across anatomical structures. We provide an extensive overview ranging from cardiac to neurological to lung imaging. We also focus on the clinical applicability of models to diseased anatomy, and the influence of their training and testing data. We examine publicly available datasets, computational demands, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight the emerging research directions including multimodal integration and cross-modality frameworks. This review aims to provide researchers with a structured overview of current 3D reconstruction methodologies to identify opportunities for advancing deep learning towards more robust, generalizable, and clinically impactful solutions.

Abstract: Simulating in silico cellular responses to interventions is a promising direction to accelerate high-content image-based assays, critical for advancing drug discovery and gene editing. To support this, we introduce MorphGen, a state-of-the-art diffusion-based generative model for fluorescent microscopy that enables controllable generation across multiple cell types and perturbations. To capture biologically meaningful patterns consistent with known cellular morphologies, MorphGen is trained with an alignment loss to match its representations to the phenotypic embeddings of OpenPhenom, a state-of-the-art biological foundation model. Unlike prior approaches that compress multichannel stains into RGB images -- thus sacrificing organelle-specific detail -- MorphGen generates the complete set of fluorescent channels jointly, preserving per-organelle structures and enabling a fine-grained morphological analysis that is essential for biological interpretation. We demonstrate biological consistency with real images via CellProfiler features, and MorphGen attains an FID score over $35\%$ lower than the prior state-of-the-art MorphoDiff, which only generates RGB images for a single cell type. Code is available at https://github.com/czi-ai/MorphGen.

<title>An Efficient Quality Metric for Video Frame Interpolation Based on Motion-Field Divergence</title>

Abstract: Video frame interpolation is a fundamental tool for temporal video enhancement, but existing quality metrics struggle to evaluate the perceptual impact of interpolation artefacts effectively. Metrics like PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS ignore temporal coherence. State-of-the-art quality metrics tailored towards video frame interpolation, like FloLPIPS, have been developed but suffer from computational inefficiency that limits their practical application. We present $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$, a novel full-reference quality metric that enhances PSNR through motion divergence weighting, a technique adapted from archival film restoration where it was developed to detect temporal inconsistencies. Our approach highlights singularities in motion fields which is then used to weight image errors. Evaluation on the BVI-VFI dataset (180 sequences across multiple frame rates, resolutions and interpolation methods) shows $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ achieves statistically significant improvements: +0.09 Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient over FloLPIPS, while being 2.5$\times$ faster and using 4$\times$ less memory. Performance remains consistent across all content categories and are robust to the motion estimator used. The efficiency and accuracy of $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ enables fast quality evaluation and practical use as a loss function for training neural networks for video frame interpolation tasks. An implementation of our metric is available at www.github.com/conalld/psnr-div.

Abstract: Robots must adapt to diverse human instructions and operate safely in unstructured, open-world environments. Recent Vision-Language models (VLMs) offer strong priors for grounding language and perception, but remain difficult to steer for navigation due to differences in action spaces and pretraining objectives that hamper transferability to robotics tasks. Towards addressing this, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes internet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of directly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a visual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware navigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these visual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows natural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors. To scale training, we supervise on path masks derived from self-supervised tracking models paired with VLM-augmented captions, avoiding manual pixel-level annotation or highly engineered data collection setups. In extensive real-world evaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines on object reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks, improving success rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen scenarios. Notably, we find that VENTURA generalizes to unseen combinations of distinct tasks, revealing emergent compositional capabilities.

Abstract: Image compression and reconstruction are crucial for various digital applications. While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.

Abstract: The role that highly curated knowledge, provided by domain experts, could play in creating effective tutoring systems is often overlooked within the AI for education community. In this paper, we highlight this topic by discussing two ways such highly curated expert knowledge could help in creating novel educational systems. First, we will look at how one could use explainable AI (XAI) techniques to automatically create lessons. Most existing XAI methods are primarily aimed at debugging AI systems. However, we will discuss how one could use expert specified rules about solving specific problems along with novel XAI techniques to automatically generate lessons that could be provided to learners. Secondly, we will see how an expert specified curriculum for learning a target concept can help develop adaptive tutoring systems, that can not only provide a better learning experience, but could also allow us to use more efficient algorithms to create these systems. Finally, we will highlight the importance of such methods using a case study of creating a tutoring system for pollinator identification, where such knowledge could easily be elicited from experts.

Abstract: Humans intuitively perceive complex social signals in visual scenes, yet it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art AI models encode the same similarity structure. We study (Q1) whether modern video and language models capture human-perceived similarity in social videos, and (Q2) how to instill this structure into models using human behavioral data. To address this, we introduce a new benchmark of over 49,000 odd-one-out similarity judgments on 250 three-second video clips of social interactions, and discover a modality gap: despite the task being visual, caption-based language embeddings align better with human similarity than any pretrained video model. We close this gap by fine-tuning a TimeSformer video model on these human judgments with our novel hybrid triplet-RSA objective using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), aligning pairwise distances to human similarity. This fine-tuning protocol yields significantly improved alignment with human perceptions on held-out videos in terms of both explained variance and odd-one-out triplet accuracy. Variance partitioning shows that the fine-tuned video model increases shared variance with language embeddings and explains additional unique variance not captured by the language model. Finally, we test transfer via linear probes and find that human-similarity fine-tuning strengthens the encoding of social-affective attributes (intimacy, valence, dominance, communication) relative to the pretrained baseline. Overall, our findings highlight a gap in pretrained video models' social recognition and demonstrate that behavior-guided fine-tuning shapes video representations toward human social perception.

Abstract: We present ActiveUMI, a framework for a data collection system that transfers in-the-wild human demonstrations to robots capable of complex bimanual manipulation. ActiveUMI couples a portable VR teleoperation kit with sensorized controllers that mirror the robot's end-effectors, bridging human-robot kinematics via precise pose alignment. To ensure mobility and data quality, we introduce several key techniques, including immersive 3D model rendering, a self-contained wearable computer, and efficient calibration methods. ActiveUMI's defining feature is its capture of active, egocentric perception. By recording an operator's deliberate head movements via a head-mounted display, our system learns the crucial link between visual attention and manipulation. We evaluate ActiveUMI on six challenging bimanual tasks. Policies trained exclusively on ActiveUMI data achieve an average success rate of 70\% on in-distribution tasks and demonstrate strong generalization, retaining a 56\% success rate when tested on novel objects and in new environments. Our results demonstrate that portable data collection systems, when coupled with learned active perception, provide an effective and scalable pathway toward creating generalizable and highly capable real-world robot policies.

Abstract: While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation from visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with loose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works address this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from limited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we present MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view videos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as photorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics modeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which we carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact with the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and a novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme with our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with quasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic animations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1) dynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and efficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar generalizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not achievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation generalizability.

Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental problem in computer vision and medical imaging. However, real-world images are often degraded by structured noise with strong anisotropic correlations that existing methods struggle to remove. Most data-driven approaches rely on large datasets with high-quality labels and still suffer from limited generalizability, whereas existing zero-shot methods avoid this limitation but remain effective only for independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise. To address this gap, we propose Median2Median (M2M), a zero-shot denoising framework designed for structured noise. M2M introduces a novel sampling strategy that generates pseudo-independent sub-image pairs from a single noisy input. This strategy leverages directional interpolation and generalized median filtering to adaptively exclude values distorted by structured artifacts. To further enlarge the effective sampling space and eliminate systematic bias, a randomized assignment strategy is employed, ensuring that the sampled sub-image pairs are suitable for Noise2Noise training. In our realistic simulation studies, M2M performs on par with state-of-the-art zero-shot methods under i.i.d. noise, while consistently outperforming them under correlated noise. These findings establish M2M as an efficient, data-free solution for structured noise suppression and mark the first step toward effective zero-shot denoising beyond the strict i.i.d. assumption.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages information fusion from diverse modalities (e.g., text, audio, visual) to enhance sentiment prediction. However, simple fusion techniques often fail to account for variations in modality quality, such as those that are noisy, missing, or semantically conflicting. This oversight leads to suboptimal performance, especially in discerning subtle emotional nuances. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a simple yet efficient \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}ated \textbf{F}usion \textbf{N}etwork that adaptively adjusts feature weights via a dual gate fusion mechanism based on information entropy and modality importance. This mechanism mitigates the influence of noisy modalities and prioritizes informative cues following unimodal encoding and cross-modal interaction. Experiments on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI show that AGFN significantly outperforms strong baselines in accuracy, effectively discerning subtle emotions with robust performance. Visualization analysis of feature representations demonstrates that AGFN enhances generalization by learning from a broader feature distribution, achieved by reducing the correlation between feature location and prediction error, thereby decreasing reliance on specific locations and creating more robust multimodal feature representations.

Abstract: Preference finetuning methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with AI-generated feedback have shown promise in aligning Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with human preferences. However, existing techniques overlook the prevalence of noise in synthetic preference annotations in the form of stylistic and length biases. To this end, we introduce a hard-negative response generation framework based on LLM-guided response editing, that produces rejected responses with targeted errors, maintaining stylistic and length similarity to the accepted ones. Using this framework, we develop the VaPR dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families: LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes). Our VaPR models deliver significant performance improvements across ten benchmarks, achieving average gains of 6.5% (LLaVA), 4.0% (Qwen2VL), and 1.5% (Qwen2.5VL), with notable improvements on reasoning tasks. A scaling analysis shows that performance consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer "Yes" in binary questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on \name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o.

Abstract: Photonic crystals enable fine control over light propagation at the nanoscale, and thus play a central role in the development of photonic and quantum technologies. Photonic band diagrams (BDs) are a key tool to investigate light propagation into such inhomogeneous structured materials. However, computing BDs requires solving Maxwell's equations across many configurations, making it numerically expensive, especially when embedded in optimization loops for inverse design techniques, for example. To address this challenge, we introduce the first approach for BD generation based on diffusion models, with the capacity to later generalize and scale to arbitrary three dimensional structures. Our method couples a transformer encoder, which extracts contextual embeddings from the input structure, with a latent diffusion model to generate the corresponding BD. In addition, we provide insights into why transformers and diffusion models are well suited to capture the complex interference and scattering phenomena inherent to photonics, paving the way for new surrogate modeling strategies in this domain.

Abstract: Latent representations are critical for the performance and robustness of machine learning models, as they encode the essential features of data in a compact and informative manner. However, in vision tasks, these representations are often affected by noisy or irrelevant features, which can degrade the model's performance and generalization capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach for enhancing latent representations using unsupervised Dynamic Feature Selection (DFS). For each instance, the proposed method identifies and removes misleading or redundant information in images, ensuring that only the most relevant features contribute to the latent space. By leveraging an unsupervised framework, our approach avoids reliance on labeled data, making it broadly applicable across various domains and datasets. Experiments conducted on image datasets demonstrate that models equipped with unsupervised DFS achieve significant improvements in generalization performance across various tasks, including clustering and image generation, while incurring a minimal increase in the computational cost.

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-and-language models consist of many parameters and learn from enormous datasets, surpassing the amounts of linguistic data that children are exposed to as they acquire a language. This paper presents our approach to the multimodal track of the BabyLM challenge addressing this discrepancy. We develop language-only and multimodal models in low-resource settings using developmentally plausible datasets, with our multimodal models outperforming previous BabyLM baselines. One finding in the multimodal language model literature is that these models tend to underperform in \textit{language-only} tasks. Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \textit{model merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of language-only models using weighted linear interpolation. Our results corroborate the findings that multimodal models underperform in language-only benchmarks that focus on grammar, and model merging with text-only models can help alleviate this problem to some extent, while maintaining multimodal performance.

<title>GFSR-Net: Guided Focus via Segment-Wise Relevance Network for Interpretable Deep Learning in Medical Imaging</title>

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis, however its adoption in clinical practice is limited by a lack of interpretability. These models often make correct predictions without explaining their reasoning. They may also rely on image regions unrelated to the disease or visual cues, such as annotations, that are not present in real-world conditions. This can reduce trust and increase the risk of misleading diagnoses. We introduce the Guided Focus via Segment-Wise Relevance Network (GFSR-Net), an approach designed to improve interpretability and reliability in medical imaging. GFSR-Net uses a small number of human annotations to approximate where a person would focus within an image intuitively, without requiring precise boundaries or exhaustive markings, making the process fast and practical. During training, the model learns to align its focus with these areas, progressively emphasizing features that carry diagnostic meaning. This guidance works across different types of natural and medical images, including chest X-rays, retinal scans, and dermatological images. Our experiments demonstrate that GFSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy while producing saliency maps that better reflect human expectations. This reduces the reliance on irrelevant patterns and increases confidence in automated diagnostic tools.

<title>ZK-WAGON: Imperceptible Watermark for Image Generation Models using ZK-SNARKs</title>

Abstract: As image generation models grow increasingly powerful and accessible, concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse of synthetic media have become critical. The ability to generate lifelike images indistinguishable from real ones introduces risks such as misinformation, deepfakes, and intellectual property violations. Traditional watermarking methods either degrade image quality, are easily removed, or require access to confidential model internals - making them unsuitable for secure and scalable deployment. We are the first to introduce ZK-WAGON, a novel system for watermarking image generation models using the Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non Interactive Argument of Knowledge (ZK-SNARKs). Our approach enables verifiable proof of origin without exposing model weights, generation prompts, or any sensitive internal information. We propose Selective Layer ZK-Circuit Creation (SL-ZKCC), a method to selectively convert key layers of an image generation model into a circuit, reducing proof generation time significantly. Generated ZK-SNARK proofs are imperceptibly embedded into a generated image via Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography. We demonstrate this system on both GAN and Diffusion models, providing a secure, model-agnostic pipeline for trustworthy AI image generation.

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of efficiently reconstructing 3D scenes with high detail on objects of interest. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods allocate resources uniformly across the scene, limiting fine detail to Regions Of Interest (ROIs) and leading to inflated model size. We propose ROI-GS, an object-aware framework that enhances local details through object-guided camera selection, targeted Object training, and seamless integration of high-fidelity object of interest reconstructions into the global scene. Our method prioritizes higher resolution details on chosen objects while maintaining real-time performance. Experiments show that ROI-GS significantly improves local quality (up to 2.96 dB PSNR), while reducing overall model size by $\approx 17\%$ of baseline and achieving faster training for a scene with a single object of interest, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise, thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently, to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations, demonstrate that our $\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Abstract: Automated semantic segmentation of whole-slide images (WSIs) stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) is essential for large-scale artificial intelligence-based biomarker analysis in breast cancer. However, existing public datasets for breast cancer segmentation lack the morphological diversity needed to support model generalizability and robust biomarker validation across heterogeneous patient cohorts. We introduce BrEast cancEr hisTopathoLogy sEgmentation (BEETLE), a dataset for multiclass semantic segmentation of H&amp;E-stained breast cancer WSIs. It consists of 587 biopsies and resections from three collaborating clinical centers and two public datasets, digitized using seven scanners, and covers all molecular subtypes and histological grades. Using diverse annotation strategies, we collected annotations across four classes - invasive epithelium, non-invasive epithelium, necrosis, and other - with particular focus on morphologies underrepresented in existing datasets, such as ductal carcinoma in situ and dispersed lobular tumor cells. The dataset's diversity and relevance to the rapidly growing field of automated biomarker quantification in breast cancer ensure its high potential for reuse. Finally, we provide a well-curated, multicentric external evaluation set to enable standardized benchmarking of breast cancer segmentation models.

Abstract: Accurate reconstruction and relighting of glossy objects remain a longstanding challenge, as object shape, material properties, and illumination are inherently difficult to disentangle. Existing neural rendering approaches often rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse and specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits relighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a microfacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian Splatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically consistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface normals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate ambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates convergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections. Extensive experiments on complex, glossy scenes demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality geometry and material reconstruction, delivering substantially more realistic and consistent relighting under novel illumination compared to existing Gaussian splatting methods.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
arXiv:2510.02109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in medical imaging, yet their real-world deployment remains challenging due to spurious correlations, where models can learn non-clinical features instead of meaningful medical patterns. Existing medical imaging datasets are not designed to systematically study this issue, largely due to restrictive licensing and limited supplementary patient data. To address this gap, we introduce SpurBreast, a curated breast MRI dataset that intentionally incorporates spurious correlations to evaluate their impact on model performance. Analyzing over 100 features involving patient, device, and imaging protocol, we identify two dominant spurious signals: magnetic field strength (a global feature influencing the entire image) and image orientation (a local feature affecting spatial alignment). Through controlled dataset splits, we demonstrate that DNNs can exploit these non-clinical signals, achieving high validation accuracy while failing to generalize to unbiased test data. Alongside these two datasets containing spurious correlations, we also provide benchmark datasets without spurious correlations, allowing researchers to systematically investigate clinically relevant and irrelevant features, uncertainty estimation, adversarial robustness, and generalization strategies. Models and datasets are available at https://github.com/utkuozbulak/spurbreast.

Abstract: 3D indoor layout synthesis is crucial for creating virtual environments. Traditional methods struggle with generalization due to fixed datasets. While recent LLM and VLM-based approaches offer improved semantic richness, they often lack robust and flexible refinement, resulting in suboptimal layouts. We develop DisCo-Layout, a novel framework that disentangles and coordinates physical and semantic refinement. For independent refinement, our Semantic Refinement Tool (SRT) corrects abstract object relationships, while the Physical Refinement Tool (PRT) resolves concrete spatial issues via a grid-matching algorithm. For collaborative refinement, a multi-agent framework intelligently orchestrates these tools, featuring a planner for placement rules, a designer for initial layouts, and an evaluator for assessment. Experiments demonstrate DisCo-Layout's state-of-the-art performance, generating realistic, coherent, and generalizable 3D indoor layouts. Our code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Understanding how neural populations in higher visual areas encode object-centered visual information remains a central challenge in computational neuroscience. Prior works have investigated representational alignment between artificial neural networks and the visual cortex. Nevertheless, these findings are indirect and offer limited insights to the structure of neural populations themselves. Similarly, decoding-based methods have quantified semantic features from neural populations but have not uncovered their underlying organizations. This leaves open a scientific question: "how feature-specific visual information is distributed across neural populations in higher visual areas, and whether it is organized into structured, semantically meaningful subspaces." To tackle this problem, we present MIG-Vis, a method that leverages the generative power of diffusion models to visualize and validate the visual-semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces. Our method first uses a variational autoencoder to infer a group-wise disentangled neural latent subspace from neural populations. Subsequently, we propose a mutual information (MI)-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the specific visual-semantic features encoded by each latent group. We validate MIG-Vis on multi-session neural spiking datasets from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of two macaques. The synthesized results demonstrate that our method identifies neural latent groups with clear semantic selectivity to diverse visual features, including object pose, inter-category transformations, and intra-class content. These findings provide direct, interpretable evidence of structured semantic representation in the higher visual cortex and advance our understanding of its encoding principles.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become powerful generative priors for solving inverse imaging problems, but their reliance on slow multi-step sampling limits practical deployment. Consistency models address this bottleneck by enabling high-quality generation in a single or only a few steps, yet their direct adaptation to inverse problems is underexplored. In this paper, we present a modified consistency sampling approach tailored for inverse problem reconstruction: the sampler's stochasticity is guided by a measurement-consistency mechanism tied to the measurement operator, which enforces fidelity to the acquired measurements while retaining the efficiency of consistency-based generation. Experiments on Fashion-MNIST and LSUN Bedroom datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual and pixel-level metrics, including Fr\'echet Inception Distance, Kernel Inception Distance, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index measure, compared to baseline consistency sampling, yielding competitive or superior reconstructions with only a handful of steps.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key method for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent evidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather than expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/mail-research/SELF-llm-interference.

Abstract: Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold promise for automating everyday digital tasks, but their unreliability and high variance hinder their application to long-horizon, complex tasks. We introduce Behavior Best-of-N (bBoN), a method that scales over agents by generating multiple rollouts and selecting among them using behavior narratives that describe the agents' rollouts. It enables both wide exploration and principled trajectory selection, substantially improving robustness and success rates. On OSWorld, our bBoN scaling method establishes a new state of the art (SoTA) at 69.9%, significantly outperforming prior methods and approaching human-level performance at 72%, with comprehensive ablations validating key design choices. We further demonstrate strong generalization results to different operating systems on WindowsAgentArena and AndroidWorld. Crucially, our results highlight the unreasonable effectiveness of scaling CUAs, when you do it right: effective scaling requires structured trajectory understanding and selection, and bBoN provides a practical framework to achieve this.

Abstract: We study view-invariant imitation learning by explicitly conditioning policies on camera extrinsics. Using Plucker embeddings of per-pixel rays, we show that conditioning on extrinsics significantly improves generalization across viewpoints for standard behavior cloning policies, including ACT, Diffusion Policy, and SmolVLA. To evaluate policy robustness under realistic viewpoint shifts, we introduce six manipulation tasks in RoboSuite and ManiSkill that pair "fixed" and "randomized" scene variants, decoupling background cues from camera pose. Our analysis reveals that policies without extrinsics often infer camera pose using visual cues from static backgrounds in fixed scenes; this shortcut collapses when workspace geometry or camera placement shifts. Conditioning on extrinsics restores performance and yields robust RGB-only control without depth. We release the tasks, demonstrations, and code at https://ripl.github.io/know_your_camera/ .

Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and text-guided editing.

Abstract: We introduce VLM-Lens, a toolkit designed to enable systematic benchmarking, analysis, and interpretation of vision-language models (VLMs) by supporting the extraction of intermediate outputs from any layer during the forward pass of open-source VLMs. VLM-Lens provides a unified, YAML-configurable interface that abstracts away model-specific complexities and supports user-friendly operation across diverse VLMs. It currently supports 16 state-of-the-art base VLMs and their over 30 variants, and is extensible to accommodate new models without changing the core logic.
  The toolkit integrates easily with various interpretability and analysis methods. We demonstrate its usage with two simple analytical experiments, revealing systematic differences in the hidden representations of VLMs across layers and target concepts. VLM-Lens is released as an open-sourced project to accelerate community efforts in understanding and improving VLMs.

Abstract: Updating diffusion models in an incremental setting would be practical in real-world applications yet computationally challenging. We present a novel learning strategy of Concept Neuron Selection (CNS), a simple yet effective approach to perform personalization in a continual learning scheme. CNS uniquely identifies neurons in diffusion models that are closely related to the target concepts. In order to mitigate catastrophic forgetting problems while preserving zero-shot text-to-image generation ability, CNS finetunes concept neurons in an incremental manner and jointly preserves knowledge learned of previous concepts. Evaluation of real-world datasets demonstrates that CNS achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameter adjustments, outperforming previous methods in both single and multi-concept personalization works. CNS also achieves fusion-free operation, reducing memory storage and processing time for continual personalization.

Abstract: We introduce Equilibrium Matching (EqM), a generative modeling framework built from an equilibrium dynamics perspective. EqM discards the non-equilibrium, time-conditional dynamics in traditional diffusion and flow-based generative models and instead learns the equilibrium gradient of an implicit energy landscape. Through this approach, we can adopt an optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256$\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.

Abstract: In recent years, point cloud perception tasks have been garnering increasing attention. This paper presents the first attempt to estimate 3D human body mesh from sparse LiDAR point clouds. We found that the major challenge in estimating human pose and mesh from point clouds lies in the sparsity, noise, and incompletion of LiDAR point clouds. Facing these challenges, we propose an effective sparse-to-dense reconstruction scheme to reconstruct 3D human mesh. This involves estimating a sparse representation of a human (3D human pose) and gradually reconstructing the body mesh. To better leverage the 3D structural information of point clouds, we employ a cascaded graph transformer (graphormer) to introduce point cloud features during sparse-to-dense reconstruction. Experimental results on three publicly available databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Code: https://github.com/soullessrobot/LiDAR-HMR/

Abstract: Building accurate models for rare skin diseases remains challenging due to the lack of sufficient labeled data and the inherently long-tailed distribution of available samples. These issues are further complicated by inconsistencies in how datasets are collected and their varying objectives. To address these challenges, we compare three learning strategies: episodic learning, supervised transfer learning, and contrastive self-supervised pretraining, within a few-shot learning framework. We evaluate five training setups on three benchmark datasets: ISIC2018, Derm7pt, and SD-198. Our findings show that traditional transfer learning approaches, particularly those based on MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, consistently outperform episodic and self-supervised methods as the number of training examples increases. When combined with batch-level data augmentation techniques such as MixUp, CutMix, and ResizeMix, these models achieve state-of-the-art performance on the SD-198 and Derm7pt datasets, and deliver highly competitive results on ISIC2018. All the source codes related to this work will be made publicly available soon at the provided URL.

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as powerful tools across various domains including language, vision, and multimodal tasks. While prior works have addressed unsupervised image segmentation, they significantly lag behind supervised models. In this paper, we use a diffusion UNet encoder as a foundation vision encoder and introduce DiffCut, an unsupervised zero-shot segmentation method that solely harnesses the output features from the final self-attention block. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the utilization of these diffusion features in a graph based segmentation algorithm, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot segmentation. Specifically, we leverage a recursive Normalized Cut algorithm that softly regulates the granularity of detected objects and produces well-defined segmentation maps that precisely capture intricate image details. Our work highlights the remarkably accurate semantic knowledge embedded within diffusion UNet encoders that could then serve as foundation vision encoders for downstream tasks.

Abstract: We propose a means of computing fitted frames on the boundary and in the interior of objects and using them to provide the basis for producing geometric features from them that are not only alignment-free but most importantly can be made to correspond locally across a population of objects. We describe a representation targeted for anatomic objects which is designed to enable this strong locational correspondence within object populations and thus to provide powerful object statistics. It accomplishes this by understanding an object as the diffeomorphic deformation of the closure of the interior of an ellipsoid and by using a skeletal representation fitted throughout the deformation to produce a model of the target object, where the object is provided initially in the form of a boundary mesh. Via classification performance on hippocampi shape between individuals with a disorder vs. others, we compare our method to two state-of-theart methods for producing object representations that are intended to capture geometric correspondence across a population of objects and to yield geometric features useful for statistics, and we show notably improved classification performance by this new representation, which we call the evolutionary s-rep. The geometric features that are derived from each of the representations, especially via fitted frames, are discussed.

<title>Sparkle: Mastering Basic Spatial Capabilities in Vision Language Models Elicits Generalization to Spatial Reasoning</title>

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) perform well on many tasks but often fail at spatial reasoning, which is essential for navigation and interaction with physical environments. Many spatial reasoning tasks depend on fundamental two-dimensional (2D) skills, yet our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art VLMs give implausible or incorrect answers to composite spatial problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans solve effortlessly. To address this, we enhance 2D spatial reasoning in VLMs by training them only on basic spatial capabilities. We first disentangle 2D spatial reasoning into three core components: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. We hypothesize that mastering these skills substantially improves performance on complex spatial tasks that require advanced reasoning and combinatorial problem solving, while also generalizing to real-world scenarios. To test this, we introduce Sparkle, a framework that generates synthetic data to provide targeted supervision across these three capabilities and yields an instruction dataset for each. Experiments show that VLMs fine-tuned with \emph{Sparkle} improve not only on basic tasks but also on composite and out-of-distribution real-world spatial reasoning tasks. These results indicate that enhancing basic spatial skills through synthetic generalization effectively advances complex spatial reasoning and offers a systematic strategy for boosting the spatial understanding of VLMs. Source codes of Sparkle are available at https://github.com/YihongT/Sparkle.

Abstract: Diffusion Models achieve state-of-the-art performance in generating new samples but lack a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the data into editable features. Inversion-based methods address this by reversing the denoising trajectory, transferring images to their approximated starting noise. In this work, we thoroughly analyze this procedure and focus on the relation between the initial noise, the generated samples, and their corresponding latent encodings obtained through the DDIM inversion. First, we show that latents exhibit structural patterns in the form of less diverse noise predicted for smooth image areas (e.g., plain sky). Through a series of analyses, we trace this issue to the first inversion steps, which fail to provide accurate and diverse noise. Consequently, the DDIM inversion space is notably less manipulative than the original noise. We show that prior inversion methods do not fully resolve this issue, but our simple fix, where we replace the first DDIM Inversion steps with a forward diffusion process, successfully decorrelates latent encodings and enables higher quality editions and interpolations.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has been a popular and effective method for model compression. One important assumption of KD is that the teacher's original dataset will also be available when training the student. However, in situations such as continual learning and distilling large models trained on company-withheld datasets, having access to the original data may not always be possible. This leads practitioners towards utilizing other sources of supplemental data, which could yield mixed results. One must then ask: "what makes a good dataset for transferring knowledge from teacher to student?" Many would assume that only real in-domain imagery is viable, but is that the only option? In this work, we explore multiple possible surrogate distillation datasets and demonstrate that many different datasets, even unnatural synthetic imagery, can serve as a suitable alternative in KD. From examining these alternative datasets, we identify and present various criteria describing what makes a good dataset for distillation. Source code is available at https://github.com/osu-cvl/good-kd-dataset.

Abstract: Current video generation models excel at short clips but fail to produce cohesive multi-shot narratives due to disjointed visual dynamics and fractured storylines. Existing solutions either rely on extensive manual scripting/editing or prioritize single-shot fidelity over cross-scene continuity, limiting their practicality for movie-like content. We introduce VideoGen-of-Thought (VGoT), a step-by-step framework that automates multi-shot video synthesis from a single sentence by systematically addressing three core challenges: (1) Narrative fragmentation: Existing methods lack structured storytelling. We propose dynamic storyline modeling, which turns the user prompt into concise shot drafts and then expands them into detailed specifications across five domains (character dynamics, background continuity, relationship evolution, camera movements, and HDR lighting) with self-validation to ensure logical progress. (2) Visual inconsistency: previous approaches struggle to maintain consistent appearance across shots. Our identity-aware cross-shot propagation builds identity-preserving portrait (IPP) tokens that keep character identity while allowing controlled trait changes (expressions, aging) required by the story. (3) Transition artifacts: Abrupt shot changes disrupt immersion. Our adjacent latent transition mechanisms implement boundary-aware reset strategies that process adjacent shots' features at transition points, enabling seamless visual flow while preserving narrative continuity. Combined in a training-free pipeline, VGoT surpasses strong baselines by 20.4\% in within-shot face consistency and 17.4\% in style consistency, while requiring 10x fewer manual adjustments. VGoT bridges the gap between raw visual synthesis and director-level storytelling for automated multi-shot video generation.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and SigLIP, have found remarkable success in classification, retrieval, and generative tasks. For this, VLMs deterministically map images and text descriptions to a joint latent space in which their similarity is assessed using the cosine similarity. However, a deterministic mapping of inputs fails to capture uncertainties over concepts arising from domain shifts when used in downstream tasks. In this work, we propose post-hoc uncertainty estimation in VLMs that does not require additional training. Our method leverages a Bayesian posterior approximation over the last layers in VLMs and analytically quantifies uncertainties over cosine similarities. We demonstrate its effectiveness for uncertainty quantification and support set selection in active learning. Compared to baselines, we obtain improved and well-calibrated predictive uncertainties, interpretable uncertainty estimates, and sample-efficient active learning. Our results show promise for safety-critical applications of large-scale models.

Abstract: Currently, the success of large language models (LLMs) illustrates that a unified multitasking approach can significantly enhance model usability, streamline deployment, and foster synergistic benefits across different tasks. However, in computer vision, while text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved generation quality through scaling up, their framework design did not initially consider how to unify with downstream tasks, such as various types of editing. To address this, we introduce DreamOmni, a unified model for image generation and editing. We begin by analyzing existing frameworks and the requirements of downstream tasks, proposing a unified framework that integrates both T2I models and various editing tasks. Furthermore, another key challenge is the efficient creation of high-quality editing data, particularly for instruction-based and drag-based editing. To this end, we develop a synthetic data pipeline using sticker-like elements to synthesize accurate, high-quality datasets efficiently, which enables editing data scaling up for unified model training. For training, DreamOmni jointly trains T2I generation and downstream tasks. T2I training enhances the model's understanding of specific concepts and improves generation quality, while editing training helps the model grasp the nuances of the editing task. This collaboration significantly boosts editing performance. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of DreamOmni. The code and model will be released.

Abstract: Model compression is essential in the deployment of large Computer Vision models on embedded devices. However, static optimization techniques (e.g. pruning, quantization, etc.) neglect the fact that different inputs have different complexities, thus requiring different amount of computations. Dynamic Neural Networks allow to condition the number of computations to the specific input. The current literature on the topic is very extensive and fragmented. We present a comprehensive survey that synthesizes and unifies existing Dynamic Neural Networks research in the context of Computer Vision. Additionally, we provide a logical taxonomy based on which component of the network is adaptive: the output, the computation graph or the input. Furthermore, we argue that Dynamic Neural Networks are particularly beneficial in the context of Sensor Fusion for better adaptivity, noise reduction and information prioritization. We present preliminary works in this direction. We complement this survey with a curated repository listing all the surveyed papers, each with a brief summary of the solution and the code base when available: https://github.com/DTU-PAS/awesome-dynn-for-cv .

Abstract: The diffusion models are widely used for image and video generation, but their iterative generation process is slow and expansive. While existing distillation approaches have demonstrated the potential for one-step generation in the image domain, they still suffer from significant quality degradation. In this work, we propose Adversarial Post-Training (APT) against real data following diffusion pre-training for one-step video generation. To improve the training stability and quality, we introduce several improvements to the model architecture and training procedures, along with an approximated R1 regularization objective. Empirically, our experiments show that our adversarial post-trained model, Seaweed-APT, can generate 2-second, 1280x720, 24fps videos in real time using a single forward evaluation step. Additionally, our model is capable of generating 1024px images in a single step, achieving quality comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

<title>Multiple Queries with Multiple Keys: A Precise Prompt Matching Paradigm for Prompt-based Continual Learning</title>

Abstract: Continual learning requires machine learning models to continuously acquire new knowledge in dynamic environments while avoiding the forgetting of previous knowledge. Prompt-based continual learning methods effectively address the issue of catastrophic forgetting through prompt expansion and selection. However, existing approaches often suffer from low accuracy in prompt selection, which can result in the model receiving biased knowledge and making biased predictions. To address this issue, we propose the Multiple Queries with Multiple Keys (MQMK) prompt matching paradigm for precise prompt selection. The goal of MQMK is to select the prompts whose training data distribution most closely matches that of the test sample. Specifically, Multiple Queries enable precise breadth search by introducing task-specific knowledge, while Multiple Keys perform deep search by representing the feature distribution of training samples at a fine-grained level. Each query is designed to perform local matching with a designated task to reduce interference across queries. Experiments show that MQMK enhances the prompt matching rate by over 30\% in challenging scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three widely adopted continual learning benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/DunweiTu/MQMK.

Abstract: The spatio-temporal relationship between the pixels of a video carries critical information for low-level 4D perception tasks. A single model that reasons about it should be able to solve several such tasks well. Yet, most state-of-the-art methods rely on architectures specialized for the task at hand. We present L4P, a feedforward, general-purpose architecture that solves low-level 4D perception tasks in a unified framework. L4P leverages a pre-trained ViT-based video encoder and combines it with per-task heads that are lightweight and therefore do not require extensive training. Despite its general and feedforward formulation, our method is competitive with existing specialized methods on both dense tasks, such as depth or optical flow estimation, and sparse tasks, such as 2D/3D tracking. Moreover, it solves all tasks at once in a time comparable to that of single-task methods.

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models are commonly used to generate clean data (e.g., images) from random noises, effectively forming pairs of noises and corresponding clean images. Distillation on these pre-trained models can be viewed as the process of constructing advanced trajectories within the pair to accelerate sampling. For instance, consistency model distillation develops consistent projection functions to regulate trajectories, although sampling efficiency remains a concern. Rectified flow method enforces straight trajectories to enable faster sampling, yet relies on numerical ODE solvers, which may introduce approximation errors. In this work, we bridge the gap between the consistency model and the rectified flow method by proposing a Straight Consistent Trajectory~(SCoT) model. SCoT enjoys the benefits of both approaches for fast sampling, producing trajectories with consistent and straight properties simultaneously. These dual properties are strategically balanced by targeting two critical objectives: (1) regulating the gradient of SCoT's mapping to a constant, (2) ensuring trajectory consistency. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SCoT.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) generation models have achieved remarkable sucess by training on billion-scale datasets, following a `bigger is better' paradigm that prioritizes data quantity over availability (closed vs open source) and reproducibility (data decay vs established collections). We challenge this established paradigm by demonstrating that one can achieve capabilities of models trained on massive web-scraped collections, using only ImageNet enhanced with well-designed text and image augmentations. With this much simpler setup, we achieve a +6% overall score over SD-XL on GenEval and +5% on DPGBench while using just 1/10th the parameters and 1/1000th the training images. We also show that ImageNet pretrained models can be finetuned on task specific datasets (like for high resolution aesthetic applications) with good results, indicating that ImageNet is sufficient for acquiring general capabilities. This opens the way for more reproducible research as ImageNet is widely available and the proposed standardized training setup only requires 500 hours of H100 to train a text-to-image model.

Abstract: Purpose High dimensional, multimodal data can nowadays be analyzed by huge deep neural networks with little effort. Several fusion methods for bringing together different modalities have been developed. Given the prevalence of high-dimensional, multimodal patient data in medicine, the development of multimodal models marks a significant advancement. However, how these models process information from individual sources in detail is still underexplored. Methods To this end, we implemented an occlusion-based modality contribution method that is both model- and performance-agnostic. This method quantitatively measures the importance of each modality in the dataset for the model to fulfill its task. We applied our method to three different multimodal medical problems for experimental purposes. Results Herein we found that some networks have modality preferences that tend to unimodal collapses, while some datasets are imbalanced from the ground up. Moreover, we provide fine-grained quantitative and visual attribute importance for each modality. Conclusion Our metric offers valuable insights that can support the advancement of multimodal model development and dataset creation. By introducing this method, we contribute to the growing field of interpretability in deep learning for multimodal research. This approach helps to facilitate the integration of multimodal AI into clinical practice. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/ChristianGappGit/MC_MMD.

Abstract: Rice is a staple food for a significant portion of the world's population, providing essential nutrients and serving as a versatile in-gredient in a wide range of culinary traditions. Recently, the use of deep learning has enabled automated classification of rice, im-proving accuracy and efficiency. However, classical models based on first-stage training may face difficulties in distinguishing between rice varieties with similar external characteristics, thus leading to misclassifications. Considering the transparency and feasibility of model, we selected and gradually improved pure fully connected neural network to achieve classification of rice grain. The dataset we used contains both global and domestic rice images obtained from websites and laboratories respectively. First, the training mode was changed from one-stage training to two-stage training, which significantly contributes to distinguishing two similar types of rice. Secondly, the preprocessing method was changed from random tilting to horizontal or vertical position cor-rection. After those two enhancements, the accuracy of our model increased notably from 97% to 99%. In summary, two subtle methods proposed in this study can remarkably enhance the classification ability of deep learning models in terms of the classification of rice grain.

Abstract: Moving object segmentation (MOS) on LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous systems like self-driving vehicles. Previous supervised approaches rely heavily on costly manual annotations, while LiDAR sequences naturally capture temporal motion cues that can be leveraged for self-supervised learning. In this paper, we propose Temporal Overlapping Prediction (TOP), a self-supervised pre-training method that alleviate the labeling burden for MOS. TOP explores the temporal overlapping points that commonly observed by current and adjacent scans, and learns spatiotemporal representations by predicting the occupancy states of temporal overlapping points. Moreover, we utilize current occupancy reconstruction as an auxiliary pre-training objective, which enhances the current structural awareness of the model. We conduct extensive experiments and observe that the conventional metric Intersection-over-Union (IoU) shows strong bias to objects with more scanned points, which might neglect small or distant objects. To compensate for this bias, we introduce an additional metric called mIoU_obj to evaluate object-level performance. Experiments on nuScenes and SemanticKITTI show that TOPoutperforms both supervised training-from-scratch baseline and other self-supervised pre-training baselines by up to 28.77% relative improvement, demonstrating strong transferability across LiDAR setups and generalization to other tasks. Code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

Abstract: Object-centric understanding is fundamental to human vision and required for complex reasoning. Traditional methods define slot-based bottlenecks to learn object properties explicitly, while recent self-supervised vision models like DINO have shown emergent object understanding. We investigate the effectiveness of self-supervised representations from models such as CLIP, DINOv2 and DINOv3, as well as slot-based approaches, for multi-object instance retrieval, where specific objects must be faithfully identified in a scene. This scenario is increasingly relevant as pre-trained representations are deployed in downstream tasks, e.g., retrieval, manipulation, and goal-conditioned policies that demand fine-grained object understanding. Our findings reveal that self-supervised vision models and slot-based representations excel at identifying edge-derived geometry (shape, size) but fail to preserve non-geometric surface-level cues (colour, material, texture), which are critical for disambiguating objects when reasoning about or selecting them in such tasks. We show that learning an auxiliary latent space over segmented patches, where VAE regularisation enforces compact, disentangled object-centric representations, recovers these missing attributes. Augmenting the self-supervised methods with such latents improves retrieval across all attributes, suggesting a promising direction for making self-supervised representations more reliable in downstream tasks that require precise object-level reasoning.

Abstract: Diffusion models for super-resolution (SR) produce high-quality visual results but require expensive computational costs. Despite the development of several methods to accelerate diffusion-based SR models, some (e.g., SinSR) fail to produce realistic perceptual details, while others (e.g., OSEDiff) may hallucinate non-existent structures. To overcome these issues, we present RSD, a new distillation method for ResShift, one of the top diffusion-based SR models. Our method is based on training the student network to produce such images that a new fake ResShift model trained on them will coincide with the teacher model. RSD achieves single-step restoration and outperforms the teacher by a large margin. We show that our distillation method can surpass the other distillation-based method for ResShift - SinSR - making it on par with state-of-the-art diffusion-based SR distillation methods. Compared to SR methods based on pre-trained text-to-image models, RSD produces competitive perceptual quality, provides images with better alignment to degraded input images, and requires fewer parameters and GPU memory. We provide experimental results on various real-world and synthetic datasets, including RealSR, RealSet65, DRealSR, ImageNet, and DIV2K.

Our pipeline estimates editable material properties and environment illumination while employing a directional residual pass that captures leftover view-dependent effects for further refining novel view synthesis. In contrast to per-Gaussian shading with shortest-axis normals and normal residuals, which tends to result in more noisy geometry and specular appearance, a pixel-deferred surfel formulation with specular residuals yields sharper highlights, cleaner materials, and improved editability. We evaluate our approach on rendering and reconstruction quality on three popular datasets featuring glossy objects, and also demonstrate high-quality relighting and material editing.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, place recognition is critical for global localization in GPS-denied environments. LiDAR and radar-based place recognition methods have garnered increasing attention, as LiDAR provides precise ranging, whereas radar excels in adverse weather resilience. However, effectively leveraging LiDAR-radar fusion for place recognition remains challenging. The noisy and sparse nature of radar data limits its potential to further improve recognition accuracy. In addition, heterogeneous radar configurations complicate the development of unified cross-modality fusion frameworks. In this paper, we propose LRFusionPR, which improves recognition accuracy and robustness by fusing LiDAR with either single-chip or scanning radar. Technically, a dual-branch network is proposed to fuse different modalities within the unified polar coordinate bird's eye view (BEV) representation. In the fusion branch, cross-attention is utilized to perform cross-modality feature interactions. The knowledge from the fusion branch is simultaneously transferred to the distillation branch, which takes radar as its only input to further improve the robustness. Ultimately, the descriptors from both branches are concatenated, producing the multimodal global descriptor for place retrieval. Extensive evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our LRFusionPR achieves accurate place recognition, while maintaining robustness under varying weather conditions. Our open-source code will be released at https://github.com/QiZS-BIT/LRFusionPR.

Abstract: Humans (and many vertebrates) face the problem of fusing together multiple fixations of a scene in order to obtain a representation of the whole, where each fixation uses a high-resolution fovea and decreasing resolution in the periphery. In this paper we explicitly represent the retinal transformation of a fixation as a linear downsampling of a high-resolution latent image of the scene, exploiting the known geometry. This linear transformation allows us to carry out exact inference for the latent variables in factor analysis (FA) and mixtures of FA models of the scene. Further, this allows us to formulate and solve the choice of "where to look next" as a Bayesian experimental design problem using the Expected Information Gain criterion. Experiments on the Frey faces and MNIST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our models.

Abstract: We introduce the novel task of Language-Guided Object Placement in Real 3D Scenes. Our model is given a 3D scene's point cloud, a 3D asset, and a textual prompt broadly describing where the 3D asset should be placed. The task here is to find a valid placement for the 3D asset that respects the prompt. Compared with other language-guided localization tasks in 3D scenes such as grounding, this task has specific challenges: it is ambiguous because it has multiple valid solutions, and it requires reasoning about 3D geometric relationships and free space. We inaugurate this task by proposing a new benchmark and evaluation protocol. We also introduce a new dataset for training 3D LLMs on this task, as well as the first method to serve as a non-trivial baseline. We believe that this challenging task and our new benchmark could become part of the suite of benchmarks used to evaluate and compare generalist 3D LLM models.

<title>Accelerating Targeted Hard-Label Adversarial Attacks in Low-Query Black-Box Settings</title>

Abstract: Deep neural networks for image classification remain vulnerable to adversarial examples -- small, imperceptible perturbations that induce misclassifications. In black-box settings, where only the final prediction is accessible, crafting targeted attacks that aim to misclassify into a specific target class is particularly challenging due to narrow decision regions. Current state-of-the-art methods often exploit the geometric properties of the decision boundary separating a source image and a target image rather than incorporating information from the images themselves. In contrast, we propose Targeted Edge-informed Attack (TEA), a novel attack that utilizes edge information from the target image to carefully perturb it, thereby producing an adversarial image that is closer to the source image while still achieving the desired target classification. Our approach consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art methods across different models in low query settings (nearly 70% fewer queries are used), a scenario especially relevant in real-world applications with limited queries and black-box access. Furthermore, by efficiently generating a suitable adversarial example, TEA provides an improved target initialization for established geometry-based attacks.

Abstract: We present \textbf{GARLIC}, a representation learning approach for Euclidean approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in high dimensions. Existing partitions tend to rely on isotropic cells, fixed global resolution, or balanced constraints, which fragment dense regions and merge unrelated points in sparse ones, thereby increasing the candidate count when probing only a few cells. Our method instead partitions \(\mathbb{R}^d\) into anisotropic Gaussian cells whose shapes align with local geometry and sizes adapt to data density. Information-theoretic objectives balance coverage, overlap, and geometric alignment, while split/clone refinement introduces Gaussians only where needed. At query time, Mahalanobis distance selects relevant cells and localized quantization prunes candidates. This yields partitions that reduce cross-cell neighbor splits and candidate counts under small probe budgets, while remaining robust even when trained on only a small fraction of the dataset. Overall, GARLIC introduces a geometry-aware space-partitioning paradigm that combines information-theoretic objectives with adaptive density refinement, offering competitive recall--efficiency trade-offs for Euclidean ANN search.

Abstract: Existing large-scale video generation models are computationally intensive, preventing adoption in real-time and interactive applications. In this work, we propose autoregressive adversarial post-training (AAPT) to transform a pre-trained latent video diffusion model into a real-time, interactive video generator. Our model autoregressively generates a latent frame at a time using a single neural function evaluation (1NFE). The model can stream the result to the user in real time and receive interactive responses as controls to generate the next latent frame. Unlike existing approaches, our method explores adversarial training as an effective paradigm for autoregressive generation. This not only allows us to design an architecture that is more efficient for one-step generation while fully utilizing the KV cache, but also enables training the model in a student-forcing manner that proves to be effective in reducing error accumulation during long video generation. Our experiments demonstrate that our 8B model achieves real-time, 24fps, streaming video generation at 736x416 resolution on a single H100, or 1280x720 on 8xH100 up to a minute long (1440 frames).

Abstract: We propose Legato, a new end-to-end model for optical music recognition (OMR), a task of converting music score images to machine-readable documents. Legato is the first large-scale pretrained OMR model capable of recognizing full-page or multi-page typeset music scores and the first to generate documents in ABC notation, a concise, human-readable format for symbolic music. Bringing together a pretrained vision encoder with an ABC decoder trained on a dataset of more than 214K images, our model exhibits the strong ability to generalize across various typeset scores. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a range of datasets and metrics and demonstrate that Legato outperforms the previous state of the art. On our most realistic dataset, we see a 68\% and 47.6\% absolute error reduction on the standard metrics TEDn and OMR-NED, respectively.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs), represented by Stable Diffusion, which generate highly realistic images based on textual input, have been widely used, but their flexibility also makes them prone to misuse for producing harmful or unsafe content. Concept unlearning has been used to prevent text-to-image diffusion models from being misused to generate undesirable visual content. However, existing methods struggle to trade off unlearning effectiveness with the preservation of generation quality. To address this limitation, we propose Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU), which selectively fine-tunes the model at key steps to the target concept. KSCU is inspired by the fact that different diffusion denoising steps contribute unequally to the final generation. Compared to previous approaches, which treat all denoising steps uniformly, KSCU avoids over-optimization of unnecessary steps for higher effectiveness and reduces the number of parameter updates for higher efficiency. For example, on the I2P dataset, KSCU outperforms ESD by 8.3% in nudity unlearning accuracy while improving FID by 8.4%, and achieves a high overall score of 0.92, substantially surpassing all other SOTA methods.

Abstract: Conventional flow matching and diffusion-based policies sample through iterative denoising from standard noise distributions (e.g., Gaussian), and require conditioning mechanisms to incorporate visual information during the generative process, incurring substantial time and memory overhead. To reduce the complexity, we develop VITA(VIsion-To-Action policy), a noise-free and conditioning-free policy learning framework that directly maps visual representations to latent actions using flow matching. VITA treats latent visual representations as the source of the flow, thus eliminating the need of conditioning. As expected, bridging vision and action is challenging, because actions are lower-dimensional, less structured, and sparser than visual representations; moreover, flow matching requires the source and target to have the same dimensionality. To overcome this, we introduce an action autoencoder that maps raw actions into a structured latent space aligned with visual latents, trained jointly with flow matching. To further prevent latent space collapse, we propose flow latent decoding, which anchors the latent generation process by backpropagating the action reconstruction loss through the flow matching ODE (ordinary differential equations) solving steps. We evaluate VITA on 8 simulation and 2 real-world tasks from ALOHA and Robomimic. VITA outperforms or matches state-of-the-art generative policies, while achieving 1.5-2.3x faster inference compared to conventional methods with conditioning.

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000 pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model (MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA (TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module, inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing training resource consumption by a substantial margin.

Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However, existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world streaming scenarios.

Abstract: Prompt tuning has shown promising results, but its robustness and generalization to unseen categories remain limited. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the complete removal of semantic noise is a key factor restricting robustness. Existing methods typically suppress or filter out semantic noise in the prompt space, inadvertently hindering the model's robustness and its ability to generalize to unseen categories. To address this, we propose ANPrompt, a robust prompt tuning framework that actively incorporates weak semantic noise. By clustering weakly perturbed features into noise prompts and integrating them with learnable tokens in both the text and vision encoders, ANPrompt ensures controlled exposure to semantic variations. To enhance the visual pathway, we introduce the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype (NRVPP), which stabilizes visual semantics under weak perturbations. Additionally, we propose a Weak Alignment Loss (WALoss) at the logits level to enforce consistency between clean and perturbed predictions, providing stable supervision. By combining weak semantic noise exposure with logits-based consistency, ANPrompt prevents overfitting to specific phrasings while preserving semantic integrity. Extensive experiments across 11 benchmarks, including base-to-new splits, show that ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning methods, offering superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization across tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have made training object detectors more efficient and effective; however, assessing their performance in real-world applications still relies on costly manual annotation. To address this limitation, we develop an automated model evaluation (AutoEval) framework for object detection. We propose Prediction Consistency and Reliability (PCR), which leverages the multiple candidate bounding boxes that conventional detectors generate before non-maximum suppression (NMS). PCR estimates detection performance without ground-truth labels by jointly measuring 1) the spatial consistency between boxes before and after NMS, and 2) the reliability of the retained boxes via the confidence scores of overlapping boxes. For a more realistic and scalable evaluation, we construct a meta-dataset by applying image corruptions of varying severity. Experimental results demonstrate that PCR yields more accurate performance estimates than existing AutoEval methods, and the proposed meta-dataset covers a wider range of detection performance. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/autoeval-det.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level priors to determine caching timings and adopting handcrafted rules for multi-step cache utilization. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail to cope with diverse samples. In this paper, a strong sample-specific correlation is revealed between the variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion model and those of deep-layer features. Moreover, we have observed that the features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a shallow-layer online probe to obtain an on-the-fly indicator for the caching error in real time, enabling the model to dynamically customize the caching schedule for each sample. (2) Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment adaptively approximates the deep-layer feature output from multi-step historical caches based on the shallow-layer feature trajectory, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved fidelity over state-of-the-art approaches on various leading diffusion models including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo and Flux.

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant malformations.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved significant success across various tasks. These models usually encode visual inputs into dense token sequences, which are then concatenated with textual tokens and jointly processed by a language model. However, the increased token count substantially raises computational and memory costs during inference. Token pruning has emerged as a promising approach to address this issue. Existing token pruning methods often rely on costly calibration or suboptimal importance metrics, leading to redundant retained tokens. In this paper, we analyze the redundancy differences between visual and textual tokens and propose pruning exclusively on visual tokens. Based on this, we propose a visual token pruning strategy that explicitly preserves both cross-modal alignment and intra-modal informational diversity. We introduce a mutual information-based token pruning strategy that removes visual tokens semantically misaligned with textual tokens, effectively preserving the alignment between the visual and textual modalities. To further improve the representational quality of the retained tokens, we additionally prune redundant visual tokens by maximizing the expected pairwise distances in the embedding space, which is solved efficiently with a greedy algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains strong performance while reducing tokens by 88.9% on models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-NEXT-7B, resulting in a 56.7% improvement in inference speed.

Abstract: Methane is a potent greenhouse gas and a major driver of climate change, making its timely detection critical for effective mitigation. Machine learning (ML) deployed onboard satellites can enable rapid detection while reducing downlink costs, supporting faster response systems. Conventional methane detection methods often rely on image processing techniques, such as orthorectification to correct geometric distortions and matched filters to enhance plume signals. We introduce a novel approach that bypasses these preprocessing steps by using \textit{unorthorectified} data (UnorthoDOS). We find that ML models trained on this dataset achieve performance comparable to those trained on orthorectified data. Moreover, we also train models on an orthorectified dataset, showing that they can outperform the matched filter baseline (mag1c). We release model checkpoints and two ML-ready datasets comprising orthorectified and unorthorectified hyperspectral images from the Earth Surface Mineral Dust Source Investigation (EMIT) sensor at https://huggingface.co/datasets/SpaceML/UnorthoDOS , along with code at https://github.com/spaceml-org/plume-hunter.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection represents a critical challenge in remote sensing applications, where reliable identification of novel or anomalous patterns is essential for autonomous monitoring, disaster response, and environmental assessment. Despite remarkable progress in OOD detection for natural images, existing methods and benchmarks remain poorly suited to remote sensing imagery due to data scarcity, complex multi-scale scene structures, and pronounced distribution shifts. To this end, we propose RS-OOD, a novel framework that leverages remote sensing-specific vision-language modeling to enable robust few-shot OOD detection. Our approach introduces three key innovations: spatial feature enhancement that improved scene discrimination, a dual-prompt alignment mechanism that cross-verifies scene context against fine-grained semantics for spatial-semantic consistency, and a confidence-guided self-training loop that dynamically mines pseudo-labels to expand training data without manual annotation. RS-OOD consistently outperforms existing methods across multiple remote sensing benchmarks and enables efficient adaptation with minimal labeled data, demonstrating the critical value of spatial-semantic integration.

Abstract: Dense self-supervised learning (SSL) methods showed its effectiveness in enhancing the fine-grained semantic understandings of vision models. However, existing approaches often rely on parametric assumptions or complex post-processing (e.g., clustering, sorting), limiting their flexibility and stability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a non-parametric, kernel-based approach that improves the dense representations of pretrained vision encoders with a post-(pre)training. Our method propose a robust and effective alignment objective that captures statistical dependencies which matches the intrinsic structure of high-dimensional dense feature distributions. In addition, we revisit the augmentation strategies inherited from image-level SSL and propose a refined augmentation strategy for dense SSL. Our framework improves dense representations by conducting a lightweight post-training stage on top of a pretrained model. With only 14 hours of additional training on a single GPU, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating both efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at: https://github.com/YanXY000/LLFDisc

Abstract: As a developing country, Fiji is facing rapid urbanisation, which is visible in the massive development projects that include housing, roads, and civil works. In this study, we present machine learning and remote sensing frameworks to compare land use and land cover change from 2013 to 2024 in Nadi, Fiji. The ultimate goal of this study is to provide technical support in land cover/land use modelling and change detection. We used Landsat-8 satellite image for the study region and created our training dataset with labels for supervised machine learning. We used Google Earth Engine and unsupervised machine learning via k-means clustering to generate the land cover map. We used convolutional neural networks to classify the selected regions' land cover types. We present a visualisation of change detection, highlighting urban area changes over time to monitor changes in the map.

Abstract: Exams are a fundamental test of expert-level intelligence and require integrated understanding, reasoning, and generation. Existing exam-style benchmarks mainly focus on understanding and reasoning tasks, and current generation benchmarks emphasize the illustration of world knowledge and visual concepts, neglecting the evaluation of rigorous drawing exams. We introduce GenExam, the first benchmark for multidisciplinary text-to-image exams, featuring 1,000 samples across 10 subjects with exam-style prompts organized under a four-level taxonomy. Each problem is equipped with ground-truth images and fine-grained scoring points to enable a precise evaluation of semantic correctness and visual plausibility. Experiments show that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-Image-1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image achieve less than 15% strict scores, and most models yield almost 0%, suggesting the great challenge of our benchmark. By framing image generation as an exam, GenExam offers a rigorous assessment of models' ability to integrate understanding, reasoning, and generation, providing insights on the path to general AGI. Our benchmark and evaluation code are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/GenExam.

Abstract: MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) have showcased remarkable capabilities, but their performance in high-stakes, domain-specific scenarios like surgical settings, remains largely under-explored. To address this gap, we develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery analysis, grounded in structured clinical knowledge to evaluate cognition across \textit{Perception}, \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}. EyePCR offers a richly annotated corpus with more than 210k VQAs, which cover 1048 fine-grained attributes for multi-view perception, medical knowledge graph of more than 25k triplets for comprehension, and four clinically grounded reasoning tasks. The rich annotations facilitate in-depth cognitive analysis, simulating how surgeons perceive visual cues and combine them with domain knowledge to make decisions, thus greatly improving models' cognitive ability. In particular, \textbf{EyePCR-MLLM}, a domain-adapted variant of Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieves the highest accuracy on MCQs for \textit{Perception} among compared models and outperforms open-source models in \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}, rivalling commercial models like GPT-4.1. EyePCR reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs in surgical cognition and lays the foundation for benchmarking and enhancing clinical reliability of surgical video understanding models.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation in histopathology faces unique challenges: preserving tissue heterogeneity, capturing subtle morphological features, and scaling to unannotated datasets. We present a latent diffusion model that generates realistic heterogeneous histopathology images through a novel dual-conditioning approach combining semantic segmentation maps with tissue-specific visual crops. Unlike existing methods that rely on text prompts or abstract visual embeddings, our approach preserves critical morphological details by directly incorporating raw tissue crops from corresponding semantic regions. For annotated datasets (i.e., Camelyon16, Panda), we extract patches ensuring 20-80% tissue heterogeneity. For unannotated data (i.e., TCGA), we introduce a self-supervised extension that clusters whole-slide images into 100 tissue types using foundation model embeddings, automatically generating pseudo-semantic maps for training. Our method synthesizes high-fidelity images with precise region-wise annotations, achieving superior performance on downstream segmentation tasks. When evaluated on annotated datasets, models trained on our synthetic data show competitive performance to those trained on real data, demonstrating the utility of controlled heterogeneous tissue generation. In quantitative evaluation, prompt-guided synthesis reduces Frechet Distance by up to 6X on Camelyon16 (from 430.1 to 72.0) and yields 2-3x lower FD across Panda and TCGA. Downstream DeepLabv3+ models trained solely on synthetic data attain test IoU of 0.71 and 0.95 on Camelyon16 and Panda, within 1-2% of real-data baselines (0.72 and 0.96). By scaling to 11,765 TCGA whole-slide images without manual annotations, our framework offers a practical solution for an urgent need for generating diverse, annotated histopathology data, addressing a critical bottleneck in computational pathology.

Abstract: Text-guided image editing has been allowing users to transform and synthesize images through natural language instructions, offering considerable flexibility. However, most existing image editing models naively attempt to follow all user instructions, even if those instructions are inherently infeasible or contradictory, often resulting in nonsensical output. To address these challenges, we propose a context-aware method for image editing named as CAMILA (Context-Aware Masking for Image Editing with Language Alignment). CAMILA is designed to validate the contextual coherence between instructions and the image, ensuring that only relevant edits are applied to the designated regions while ignoring non-executable instructions. For comprehensive evaluation of this new method, we constructed datasets for both single- and multi-instruction image editing, incorporating the presence of infeasible requests. Our method achieves better performance and higher semantic alignment than state-of-the-art models, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling complex instruction challenges while preserving image integrity.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds great promise in reshaping the industry owing to its precision, efficiency, and objectivity. However, the brittleness of DL models to noisy and out-of-distribution inputs is ailing their deployment in sensitive fields. Current models often lack uncertainty quantification, providing only point estimates. We propose SUPER-Net, a Bayesian framework for trustworthy image segmentation via uncertainty propagation. Using Taylor series approximations, SUPER-Net propagates the mean and covariance of the model's posterior distribution across nonlinear layers. It generates two outputs simultaneously: the segmented image and a pixel-wise uncertainty map, eliminating the need for expensive Monte Carlo sampling. SUPER-Net's performance is extensively evaluated on MRI and CT scans under various noisy and adversarial conditions. Results show that SUPER-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models in robustness and accuracy. The uncertainty map identifies low-confidence areas affected by noise or attacks, allowing the model to self-assess segmentation reliability, particularly when errors arise from noise or adversarial examples.

Abstract: We consider the task of object grasping with a prosthetic hand capable of multiple grasp types. In this setting, communicating the intended grasp type often requires a high user cognitive load which can be reduced adopting shared autonomy frameworks. Among these, so-called eye-in-hand systems automatically control the hand pre-shaping before the grasp, based on visual input coming from a camera on the wrist. In this paper, we present an eye-in-hand learning-based approach for hand pre-shape classification from RGB sequences. Differently from previous work, we design the system to support the possibility to grasp each considered object part with a different grasp type. In order to overcome the lack of data of this kind and reduce the need for tedious data collection sessions for training the system, we devise a pipeline for rendering synthetic visual sequences of hand trajectories. We develop a sensorized setup to acquire real human grasping sequences for benchmarking and show that, compared on practical use cases, models trained with our synthetic dataset achieve better generalization performance than models trained on real data. We finally integrate our model on the Hannes prosthetic hand and show its practical effectiveness. We make publicly available the code and dataset to reproduce the presented results.

Abstract: The recently proposed optimization algorithm for deep neural networks Sharpness Aware Minimization (SAM) suggests perturbing parameters before gradient calculation by a gradient ascent step to guide the optimization into parameter space regions of flat loss. While significant generalization improvements and thus reduction of overfitting could be demonstrated, the computational costs are doubled due to the additionally needed gradient calculation, making SAM unfeasible in case of limited computationally capacities. Motivated by Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG) we propose Momentum-SAM (MSAM), which perturbs parameters in the direction of the accumulated momentum vector to achieve low sharpness without significant computational overhead or memory demands over SGD or Adam. We evaluate MSAM in detail and reveal insights on separable mechanisms of NAG, SAM and MSAM regarding training optimization and generalization. Code is available at https://github.com/MarlonBecker/MSAM.

Abstract: This paper addresses Visual Place Recognition (VPR), which is essential for the safe navigation of mobile robots. The solution we propose employs panoramic images and deep learning models, which are fine-tuned with triplet loss functions that integrate curriculum learning strategies. By progressively presenting more challenging examples during training, these loss functions enable the model to learn more discriminative and robust feature representations, overcoming the limitations of conventional contrastive loss functions. After training, VPR is tackled in two steps: coarse (room retrieval) and fine (position estimation). The results demonstrate that the curriculum-based triplet losses consistently outperform standard contrastive loss functions, particularly under challenging perceptual conditions. To thoroughly assess the robustness and generalization capabilities of the proposed method, it is evaluated in a variety of indoor and outdoor environments. The approach is tested against common challenges in real operation conditions, including severe illumination changes, the presence of dynamic visual effects such as noise and occlusions, and scenarios with limited training data. The results show that the proposed framework performs competitively in all these situations, achieving high recognition accuracy and demonstrating its potential as a reliable solution for real-world robotic applications. The code used in the experiments is available at https://github.com/MarcosAlfaro/TripletNetworksIndoorLocalization.git.

Abstract: Improving the efficiency of neural network inference is undeniably important in a time where commercial use of AI models increases daily. Node pruning is the art of removing computational units such as neurons, filters, attention heads, or even entire layers to significantly reduce inference time while retaining network performance. In this work, we propose the projection of unit activations to an orthogonal subspace in which there is no redundant activity and within which we may prune nodes while simultaneously recovering the impact of lost units via linear least squares. We furthermore show that the order in which units are orthogonalized can be optimized to maximally rank units by their redundancy. Finally, we leverage these orthogonal subspaces to automatically determine layer-wise pruning ratios based upon the relative scale of node activations in our subspace, equivalent to cumulative variance. Our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art pruning results on ImageNet-trained VGG-16, ResNet-50 and DeiT models while simultaneously having up to 24x lower computational cost than alternative methods. We also demonstrate that this method can be applied in a one-shot manner to OPT LLM models, again outperforming competing methods.

Abstract: Sound plays a major role in human perception. Along with vision, it provides essential information for understanding our surroundings. Despite advances in neural implicit representations, learning acoustics that align with visual scenes remains a challenge. We propose NeRAF, a method that jointly learns acoustic and radiance fields. NeRAF synthesizes both novel views and spatialized room impulse responses (RIR) at new positions by conditioning the acoustic field on 3D scene geometric and appearance priors from the radiance field. The generated RIR can be applied to auralize any audio signal. Each modality can be rendered independently and at spatially distinct positions, offering greater versatility. We demonstrate that NeRAF generates high-quality audio on SoundSpaces and RAF datasets, achieving significant performance improvements over prior methods while being more data-efficient. Additionally, NeRAF enhances novel view synthesis of complex scenes trained with sparse data through cross-modal learning. NeRAF is designed as a Nerfstudio module, providing convenient access to realistic audio-visual generation.

Abstract: Most control techniques for prosthetic grasping focus on dexterous fingers control, but overlook the wrist motion. This forces the user to perform compensatory movements with the elbow, shoulder and hip to adapt the wrist for grasping. We propose a computer vision-based system that leverages the collaboration between the user and an automatic system in a shared autonomy framework, to perform continuous control of the wrist degrees of freedom in a prosthetic arm, promoting a more natural approach-to-grasp motion. Our pipeline allows to seamlessly control the prosthetic wrist to follow the target object and finally orient it for grasping according to the user intent. We assess the effectiveness of each system component through quantitative analysis and finally deploy our method on the Hannes prosthetic arm.

Abstract: Time series analysis (TSA) is a longstanding research topic in the data mining community and has wide real-world significance. Compared to "richer" modalities such as language and vision, which have recently experienced explosive development and are densely connected, the time-series modality remains relatively underexplored and isolated. We notice that many recent TSA works have formed a new research field, i.e., Multiple Modalities for TSA (MM4TSA). In general, these MM4TSA works follow a common motivation: how TSA can benefit from multiple modalities. This survey is the first to offer a comprehensive review and a detailed outlook for this emerging field. Specifically, we systematically discuss three benefits: (1) reusing foundation models of other modalities for efficient TSA, (2) multimodal extension for enhanced TSA, and (3) cross-modality interaction for advanced TSA. We further group the works by the introduced modality type, including text, images, audio, tables, and others, within each perspective. Finally, we identify the gaps with future opportunities, including the reused modalities selections, heterogeneous modality combinations, and unseen tasks generalizations, corresponding to the three benefits. We release an up-to-date GitHub repository that includes key papers and resources.

Abstract: Transformer-based multimodal models are widely used in industrial-scale recommendation, search, and advertising systems for content understanding and relevance ranking. Enhancing labeled training data quality and cross-modal fusion significantly improves model performance, influencing key metrics such as quality view rates and ad revenue. High-quality annotations are crucial for advancing content modeling, yet traditional statistical-based active learning (AL) methods face limitations: they struggle to detect overconfident misclassifications and are less effective in distinguishing semantically similar items in deep neural networks. Additionally, audio information plays an increasing role, especially in short-video platforms, yet most pre-trained multimodal architectures primarily focus on text and images. While training from scratch across all three modalities is possible, it sacrifices the benefits of leveraging existing pre-trained visual-language (VL) and audio models. To address these challenges, we propose kNN-based Latent Space Broadening (LSB) to enhance AL efficiency and Vision-Language Modeling with Audio Enhancement (VLMAE), a mid-fusion approach integrating audio into VL models. This system deployed in production systems, leading to significant business gains.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation by drones using onboard sensors, combined with deep learning and computer vision algorithms, is impacting a number of domains. We examine the use of drones to autonomously follow and assist Visually Impaired People (VIPs) in navigating urban environments. Estimating the absolute distance between the drone and the VIP, and to nearby objects, is essential to design obstacle avoidance algorithms. Here, we present NeoARCADE (Neo), which uses depth maps over monocular video feeds, common in consumer drones, to estimate absolute distances to the VIP and obstacles. Neo proposes robust calibration technique based on depth score normalization and coefficient estimations to translate relative distances from depth map to absolute ones. It further develops a dynamic recalibration method that can adapt to changing scenarios. We also develop two baseline models, Regression and Geometric, and compare Neo with SOTA depth map approaches and the baselines. We provide detailed evaluations to validate their robustness and generalizability for distance estimation to VIPs and other obstacles in diverse and dynamic conditions, using datasets collected in a campus environment. Neo predicts distances to VIP with an error <30cm, and to different obstacles like cars and bicycles within a maximum error of 60cm, which are better than the baselines. Neo also clearly out-performs SOTA depth map methods, reporting errors up to 5.3-14.6x lower.

<title>Feature Representation Transferring to Lightweight Models via Perception Coherence</title>

arXiv:2505.06595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for transferring feature representation to lightweight student models from larger teacher models. We mathematically define a new notion called \textit{perception coherence}. Based on this notion, we propose a loss function, which takes into account the dissimilarities between data points in feature space through their ranking. At a high level, by minimizing this loss function, the student model learns to mimic how the teacher model \textit{perceives} inputs. More precisely, our method is motivated by the fact that the representational capacity of the student model is weaker than the teacher model. Hence, we aim to develop a new method allowing for a better relaxation. This means that, the student model does not need to preserve the absolute geometry of the teacher one, while preserving global coherence through dissimilarity ranking. Importantly, while rankings are defined only on finite sets, our notion of \textit{perception coherence} extends them into a probabilistic form. This formulation depends on the input distribution and applies to general dissimilarity metrics. Our theoretical insights provide a probabilistic perspective on the process of feature representation transfer. Our experiments results show that our method outperforms or achieves on-par performance compared to strong baseline methods for representation transferring.

Abstract: We study gradient-based data attribution, aiming to identify which training examples most influence a given output. Existing methods for this task either treat network parameters uniformly or rely on implicit weighting derived from Hessian approximations, which do not fully model functional heterogeneity of network parameters. To address this, we propose a method to explicitly learn parameter importance weights directly from data, without requiring annotated labels. Our approach improves attribution accuracy across diverse tasks, including image classification, language modeling, and diffusion, and enables fine-grained attribution for concepts like subject and style.

<title>AniMaker: Multi-Agent Animated Storytelling with MCTS-Driven Clip Generation</title>

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues. Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.

Abstract: Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its wide applicability in real-world scenarios. Among existing approaches, Long-Tailed Semi-Supervised Learning (LTSSL) has emerged as an effective solution by incorporating a large amount of unlabeled data into the imbalanced labeled dataset. However, most prior LTSSL methods are designed to train models from scratch, which often leads to issues such as overconfidence and low-quality pseudo-labels. To address these challenges, we extend LTSSL into the foundation model fine-tuning paradigm and propose a novel framework: LoFT (Long-tailed semi-supervised learning via parameter-efficient Fine-Tuning). We demonstrate that fine-tuned foundation models can generate more reliable pseudolabels, thereby benefiting imbalanced learning. Furthermore, we explore a more practical setting by investigating semi-supervised learning under open-world conditions, where the unlabeled data may include out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. To handle this problem, we propose LoFT-OW (LoFT under Open-World scenarios) to improve the discriminative ability. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to previous approaches, even when utilizing only 1\% of the unlabeled data compared with previous works.

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely used in clinical practice due to its cost-effectiveness, mobility, and safety. However, current AI research often treats disease prediction and tissue segmentation as two separate tasks and their model requires substantial computational overhead. In such a situation, we introduce UltraUPConvNet, a computationally efficient universal framework designed for both ultrasound image classification and segmentation. Trained on a large-scale dataset containing more than 9,700 annotations across seven different anatomical regions, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on certain datasets with lower computational overhead. Our model weights and codes are available at https://github.com/yyxl123/UltraUPConvNet

Abstract: Machine learning is gaining significant attention as a diagnostic tool in medical imaging, particularly in the analysis of retinal fundus images. However, this approach is not yet clinically applicable, as it still depends on human validation from a professional. Therefore, we present the design for a mobile application that monitors metrics related to retinal fundus images correlating to age-related conditions. The purpose of this platform is to observe for a change in these metrics over time, offering early insights into potential ocular diseases without explicitly delivering diagnostics. Metrics analysed include vessel tortuosity, as well as signs of glaucoma, retinopathy and macular edema. To evaluate retinopathy grade and risk of macular edema, a model was trained on the Messidor dataset and compared to a similar model trained on the MAPLES-DR dataset. Information from the DeepSeeNet glaucoma detection model, as well as tortuosity calculations, is additionally incorporated to ultimately present a retinal fundus image monitoring platform. As a result, the mobile application permits monitoring of trends or changes in ocular metrics correlated to age-related conditions with regularly uploaded photographs.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1) Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps; (2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of 3.1-5.8% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

Summary: 
The article introduces a novel Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF) module for hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) to improve spatial resolution and spectral fidelity in deep learning models. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with spectral--spatial feature extraction to enhance reconstruction in a ResNet-based convolutional neural network. Additionally, a customized Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function is proposed to optimize spatial and spectral feature reconstruction by integrating mean squared error with spatial and spectral gradient components. Experimental results on three public remote sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the hybrid model achieves competitive performance while reducing model complexity. This approach addresses the challenge of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral fidelity in hyperspectral imaging tasks.

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model complexity.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented. Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world generative AI systems.

Summary: 
1. Actions were found to be the most fragile modality in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models.
2. Existing visual-robust VLAs do not enhance robustness in other modalities.
3. The pi0 model displayed superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head.
4. RobustVLA was proposed to address perturbations in VLA inputs and outputs by optimizing against worst-case action noise and enforcing consistent actions.
5. Robustness was formulated as a multi-armed bandit problem and addressed using an upper confidence bound algorithm to identify harmful noise automatically.
6. Experiments showed RobustVLA outperformed baselines on various perturbations, achieving faster inference and gains under mixed perturbations.
7. RobustVLA was particularly effective on a real-world FR5 robot with limited demonstrations, showing significant improvements under perturbations of four modalities.

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0 demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing, and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations. Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four modalities.

<div> Keywords: vision-language models, capability-Attributed Data Curation, intrinsic capabilities, data curation, multimodal benchmarks

Summary:
Capability-Attributed Data Curation (CADC) is introduced as a framework for improving the control of large vision-language models (VLMs) through instruction tuning. By analyzing intrinsic capabilities discovered from learning trajectories, attributing training data based on these capabilities, and curating capability-aware curricula, CADC transforms instruction tuning into a controllable process. This approach surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks with as little as 5% of the original data, demonstrating the effectiveness of intrinsic capabilities in model learning. CADC establishes a principle paradigm for data curation in instruction tuning, shifting away from task-specific heuristics to capability-driven selection and sequencing. This framework shows the importance of understanding and leveraging the latent capabilities of models for improved performance. 

<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult. Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing. This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable, capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

Summary: 
- The article introduces C$^3$B, a new benchmark for evaluating cultural awareness capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
- Current benchmarks lack progression in task difficulty and do not cover cross-lingual tasks, making them insufficient for assessing MLLMs' cultural understanding.
- C$^3$B includes over 2000 images and 18000 QA pairs spanning three tasks of increasing difficulty, from visual recognition to cultural conflict understanding and content generation.
- Evaluation of 11 MLLMs on C$^3$B shows a significant performance gap compared to human performance, highlighting the challenges faced by current models in cultural awareness tasks.
- The findings underscore the need for further research to enhance MLLMs' cultural awareness capabilities, driving advancements in the field.

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics $\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs, constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance. The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness capabilities of MLLMs.

<div> gender bias, text-to-image models, occupational stereotypes, prompt wording, generative AI

Summary:
This paper examines gender representation in text-to-image models, focusing on six state-of-the-art models. The analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes, with nurses depicted exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. Different models exhibit varying levels of gender bias, with some skewing towards male dominance and others showing mixed outcomes. The study also highlights the influence of prompt wording on demographic outcomes, with certain terms reinforcing gender stereotypes. The findings emphasize the importance of bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI. Sensitivity to prompt formulation varies across models, underscoring the need for careful consideration in designing prompts to mitigate gender bias in text-to-image models. 
<br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional, educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev, Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL. Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse, paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral, aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However, differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones. Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

Summary: 
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have revolutionized text-to-image workflows, enabling rapid creation of unique visual concepts. The growth of a prompt trading market, where curated prompts defining specific styles are exchanged, has led to an overlooked security threat – prompt theft. This paper introduces RLStealer, an innovative prompt inversion framework that utilizes reinforcement learning to recover prompt templates from a small set of example images. By treating template stealing as a sequential decision-making problem and leveraging various similarity-based reward functions, RLStealer outperforms existing methods with minimal attack cost. Extensive experiments reveal RLStealer's ability to generalize across diverse image styles and efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. This study highlights the urgent need for security measures in the prompt trading ecosystem to safeguard against potential vulnerabilities in MLLMs. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold. Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs marketplace.

Vision-Language Models may produce convincing Natural Language Explanations that do not accurately reflect the causal factors behind their predictions. To address this issue, Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing (EDCT) has been introduced. This verification procedure treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis. EDCT parses the model's NLE into testable visual concepts, generates targeted counterfactual edits, and calculates a Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) to assess faithfulness. Through testing on 120 curated OK-VQA examples and multiple VLMs, EDCT reveals significant gaps in faithfulness, providing audit artifacts for regulators to identify when cited concepts fail causal tests.<br /> <div>

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis. Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2) parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal tests.

The article introduces the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe) designed to enhance the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models on high-resolution images by addressing complex background interference. Through Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) and Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD), HiDe identifies key information tokens and eliminates background interference, achieving precise alignment with target visual regions.

Notably, HiDe boosts Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B to SOTA levels, outperforming previous training-free approaches while using 75% less memory after optimization. The provided code repository allows for easy implementation and further research.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

<br />
Summary:
The Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet) has been proposed to improve remote sensing image segmentation by incorporating spatial processing methods to extract multi-scale spatial features and fine-grained details, addressing semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations. By integrating global and frequency-domain information through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the model can better discern global representations under grayscale variations. Utilizing Haar wavelet transform helps decompose features into high- and low-frequency components, enhancing boundary segmentation. The model achieves a dual-domain synergy by combining spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, leading to improved accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition zones. Experimental results show that FSDENet outperforms existing methods on various datasets, including LoveDA, Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g., shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA, Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset, delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines. Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability.

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods. This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a single model yields better compression results than using a single method uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

Summary:<br /><br />
Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise, but their ability to understand One-Image Guides, a format combining text, imagery, and symbols for easier comprehension, is not well-explored. The OIG-Bench benchmark was introduced to evaluate MLLMs' understanding of One-Image Guides using a semi-automated annotation pipeline involving intelligent agents. The benchmark evaluated 29 MLLMs, with Qwen2.5-VL-72B performing the best with 77% overall accuracy. However, all models struggled with semantic understanding and logical reasoning, indicating limitations in interpreting complex visual-text relationships. The multi-agent annotation system outperformed MLLMs in image captioning, showing potential as a high-quality image description generator and dataset construction tool.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%. Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset construction.

Summary:<br />
Geo-R1 is a new framework that focuses on geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, the framework instills a geospatial thinking paradigm through supervised fine-tuning on synthetic chain-of-thought exemplars. This helps models connect visual cues with geographic priors without requiring costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating stage, Geo-R1 uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on weakly-supervised cross-view pairing proxy to provide a scalable reward signal. This approach teaches models to capture and reconcile features across modalities and leverages reasoning for accurate prediction. By extending geospatial modeling beyond domain pretraining and supervised finetuning to reasoning-first post-training, Geo-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across various geospatial reasoning benchmarks. The model is publicly available for further exploration.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast. However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared to baselines.

<div> Keywords: hyperspectral anomaly detection, transport-based mathematical model, signed cumulative distribution transform, unsupervised subspace modeling, background signals<br />
Summary: 
This paper presents a new hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD) method using a transport-based mathematical model to analyze pixels in hyperspectral images. The approach treats pixels as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown deformations, allowing representation in the signed cumulative distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling technique is then employed to create a model of background signals in this domain, enabling the detection of anomalous signals. Extensive evaluations on five datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method over existing approaches. By addressing challenges faced in complex environments with limited prior knowledge, this method offers a significant advancement in HAD techniques. <div>
arXiv:2510.00148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures. Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Summary:
Generative models can produce realistic images on a large scale, leading to concerns about detecting and attributing synthetic images. Existing watermarking methods are vulnerable to distortions, removal, and updating costs. A new watermarking framework is proposed, using key-dependent perturbations of generative model parameters. Mixture of LoRA Markers (MOLM) is introduced within this framework, utilizing binary keys to activate lightweight adapters in residual and attention blocks. MOLM avoids the need for key-specific re-training and maintains imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experimental results on Stable Diffusion and FLUX demonstrate that MOLM maintains image quality while effectively recovering keys against various attacks, such as distortions, compression, averaging attacks, and adversarial attacks on the extractor. <div>

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions, susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the extractor.

CROWD combines data-discovery and representation learning tasks to discover and adapt to unknown objects by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain functions. It strategically mines unknown instances and disentangles known and unknown representations while maintaining discriminative coherence among known classes. CROWD significantly improves known-class accuracy on OWOD benchmarks and increases unknown recall compared to existing baselines. By reformulating the discovery and adaptation of unknown objects as a combinatorial task, CROWD effectively mitigates semantic confusion and catastrophic forgetting issues in traditional OWOD approaches. <br /><br />Summary: <div>
arXiv:2510.00303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting, leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection (CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery (CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain (SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading baselines.

Summary: <br />
The paper introduces a novel approach, ExpDWT-VAE, to enhance the latent space representation in satellite imagery utilizing Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). It combines spatial and frequency-domain features by employing dual branches, one processing spatial input through convolutional operations and the other extracting frequency-domain features using 2D Haar wavelet decomposition and reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian mapping. The proposed method is tested on a new satellite imagery dataset from the TerraFly mapping system, demonstrating improved performance metrics in enhancing the latent space representation. This innovative technique addresses a gap in existing studies by focusing on improvements within the intrinsic latent space of Latent Diffusion Models, offering significant advantages in the field of Remote Sensing applications. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications. Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation, designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method. Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

EgoTraj-Bench is introduced as a real-world benchmark for reliable trajectory prediction in robotic navigation. This benchmark addresses the limitations of existing methods by incorporating noisy, first-person visual histories into clean future trajectories. The proposed BiFlow model, a dual-stream flow matching model, denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by leveraging a shared latent representation. BiFlow also includes the EgoAnchor mechanism to better model agent intent by conditioning the prediction decoder on distilled historical features. Extensive experiments show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. This benchmark and model aim to enhance trajectory forecasting systems to be resilient to the challenges of real-world, ego-centric perception.

arXiv:2510.00405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy, first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories, enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of real-world, ego-centric perception.

Summary:<br /><br />This paper compares the performance of a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM) for pneumonia and tuberculosis detection on specific datasets. The study finds that while the VLM initially performs lower than the CNN, calibration of decision thresholds significantly enhances its performance. With calibration, the VLM achieves a higher F1-score for pneumonia detection than the CNN and comes close in tuberculosis detection. The research emphasizes that proper calibration is crucial for maximizing the diagnostic capability of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to potentially surpass task-specific supervised models in accuracy. <div>

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP, across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy: decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's 0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's 0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under data-efficient settings. Moreover, PAL-UI exhibits strong cross-domain generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory retrieval for long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents.

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT) planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025 Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of 64.8\%. These results emphasize the need for clinically tailored segmentation solutions in critical applications such as meningioma RT planning.

<div> Keywords: Diffusion Transformer, BindWeave framework, multimodal large language model, subject consistency, video generation<br />
Summary:<br />
The article introduces the BindWeave framework, which aims to improve subject-consistent video generation by integrating a multimodal large language model (MLLM-DiT) with a diffusion transformer. By leveraging deep cross-modal reasoning, the MLLM-DiT framework can effectively parse complex prompts and ground entities, roles, attributes, and interactions for subject-aware video generation. Experimental results on the OpenS2V benchmark show that the proposed method outperforms existing models in terms of subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos. The utilization of the diffusion transformer in conjunction with the MLLM-DiT framework allows for high-fidelity video generation across a wide range of subject-to-video scenarios, from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with heterogeneous entities. This approach addresses the challenges of handling complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and interactions among multiple subjects, ultimately leading to impressive results in video generation quality. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming existing open-source and commercial models.

<div> Keywords: self-supervised denoising, spectral bias, high-frequency details, Lipschitz constant, image restoration

Summary: 
The article introduces a Spectral Controlling network (SCNet) for optimizing self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images. The current methods suffer from limitations in preserving high-frequency structural details and learning high-frequency noise. The SCNet addresses these challenges by proposing a selection strategy for fast convergence, optimizing parameters using the Lipschitz constant to prevent learning high-frequency noise, and introducing the Spectral Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module) to retain high-frequency details. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SCNet in improving denoising performance. <div>
arXiv:2510.00454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image. However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images. First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant, without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify the effectiveness of SCNet.

<div> Keywords: Vision-language object detectors, test-time adaptation, domain shift, dense proposal overlap, image-conditioned prompt scores

Summary: 
Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain shift. In response, the VLOD-TTA framework introduces an IoU-weighted entropy objective to concentrate adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduce confirmation bias from isolated boxes. Additionally, image-conditioned prompt selection ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most informative prompts with detector logits. Benchmarking across diverse distribution shifts, including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light conditions, and common corruptions, shows the effectiveness of VLOD-TTA on YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent improvements over zero-shot and TTA baselines.

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic Compositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic manipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under strict conservation rules.

Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing compositional reasoning across vision and symbols.

Summary:  
The article introduces the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) framework for Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD), utilizing both normal and abnormal samples as references. Residual Mining (RM) extracts abnormal patterns from normal-abnormal reference residuals, while Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL) learns anomaly features in query images through residual mapping. The approach effectively combines normal and abnormal references for accurate cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to existing GAD methods. This work is the first to incorporate a mixture of normal and abnormal samples in generalist anomaly detection. <div>

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection.

Summary:
RAF (Relative-Absolute Fusion) is introduced as a feature extraction technique for improving image-based selection approaches in solving sparse linear systems. By combining image representations with corresponding numerical values, RAF prevents feature ambiguity across different matrices, leading to enhanced selection accuracy. Evaluations on SuiteSparse and BMCMat dataset show that RAF reduces solution time by 5.86%-11.50% compared to conventional image-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance. BMCMat dataset is available for further research. <div>

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF (Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset), demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

<div> Keywords: 3D hand pose reconstruction, occlusion, affordance, vision-language model, diffusion-based generative model

Summary: 
This article addresses the challenge of reconstructing 3D hand poses in scenarios where large portions of the hand are heavily occluded by itself or objects. Inspired by human reliance on contextual knowledge, the authors propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Their method utilizes a diffusion-based generative model conditioned on affordance descriptions inferred from a vision-language model (VLM) to refine occluded regions into more accurate hand poses. Experiments on the HOGraspNet dataset demonstrate that this affordance-guided refinement significantly enhances hand pose estimation compared to recent regression methods and diffusion-based refinement without contextual reasoning. <div>

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses. Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

Summary:
Efficient Multi-Modal Large Models (MLLMs) face challenges due to the computational resources consumed by visual tokens. Previous attempts to compress visual tokens during training have overlooked the learning difficulty caused by compression. This work introduces EPIC, a progressive learning framework that addresses these challenges by decomposing feature space perturbations through token and layer consistency distillation. By leveraging guidance from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory, EPIC aims to reduce training difficulty. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's superior effectiveness, robustness, and generalization capabilities. EPIC offers a promising solution for enhancing the efficiency of MLLMs while maintaining performance and adaptability. <br /> <div>

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework. Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation, respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

Summary:
CardioBench introduces a standardized benchmark for evaluating foundation models in echocardiography, addressing the lack of standardized benchmarks in the field. The benchmark includes eight publicly available datasets, covering various regression and classification tasks related to functional, structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. Evaluations are conducted on leading foundation models, revealing that temporal modeling is crucial for functional regression, retrieval enhances robustness under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture physiologically meaningful information. General-purpose encoders show strong transferability but struggle with fine distinctions in tasks like view classification and pathology recognition. Through the release of preprocessing pipelines and evaluation protocols, CardioBench aims to provide a reproducible reference point and offer insights for the development of future foundation models in echocardiography. <br /><br />Summary: <div>

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions, high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs. CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional, structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the design of future echocardiography foundation models.
